risk factors below. We also conduct gold exploration in West Africa and South America investing approximately $17 million in such activities during 2005. In Ghana, we are actively seeking to expand reserves around our existing mines, and we are planning to commence exploration activities with respect to the St. Jude Properties in 2006. We employ a number of different strategies to achieve our exploration goals including the following: o we maintain a staff of geologists in Ghana responsible for exploring for new resources in Ghana and for developing new reserves in areas around the existing operations; 13 o we contract with geologic consultants who advise us on existing holdings and who seek to identify new exploration opportunities; o we have purchased equity ownership in gold exploration companies that use the equity funds provided by us to explore in their areas of expertise; o we provide funding to joint venture partners that use our funding to conduct active exploration efforts; and o we maintain an international exploration group that carries out work on various properties in the Guiana Shield area of South America and in other areas of Africa outside of Ghana. OUR ASSETS Bogoso/Prestea Property- We own and operate the Bogoso/Prestea gold mine in southwest Ghana. Ore is currently mined from the Plant-North open-pit surface operation at Prestea and trucked approximately 15 kilometers to the Bogoso processing plant where the ore is processed. The current nominal capacity of the Bogoso processing plant is approximately 1.5 million tonnes per year. The Bogoso processing plant utilizes CIL technology along with gravity and flotation processes to separate gold from the ore. CIL, gravity and flotation technologies are well known and are widely used for treating gold ores. In addition to the mine and processing plant facility, Bogoso/Prestea's assets include a fleet of mining equipment, numerous ancillary facilities including warehouses, maintenance shops, roadways, administrative offices and a residential complex. Historical gold output at the Bogoso processing plant has typically ranged between 130,000 and 175,000 ounces per year. See the "Gold Production and Unit Costs" table below for additional details on historical production and operating costs. A new 3.5 million tonne per year bio-oxidation processing plant utilizing proprietary BIOXPP(R) technology is currently under construction at Bogoso. The new facility is located next to the existing Bogoso plant and will process refractory sulfide ores from the Bogoso and Prestea properties as well as from other deposits in the local area. The currently existing plant will continue to process oxide and certain non-refractory ores. The two side-by-side plants will have a combined capacity of approximately 5 million tonnes of ore per annum and should yield approximately 370,000 ounces of gold per annum once construction is completed in late 2006. Mampon - The Mampon deposit, located approximately 35 kilometers north of the Bogoso processing plant, was acquired in 2003 as part of the Dunkwa property acquisition. Mampon is an undeveloped gold deposit with 1.6 million tonnes of mineral reserves at an average grade of 4.53 g/t most of which should be recoverable by open pit mining methods. Development of this deposit as a satellite to our Bogoso/Prestea property is scheduled to begin in 2007. Pampe - The Pampe deposit is located approximately 19 kilometers west of the Bogoso processing plant. While we have owned the rights to Pampe for several years, drilling during 2005 identified an indicated mineral resource of 0.2 million tonnes at an average grade of 4.4 g/t, most of which should be recoverable by open pit mining methods. Development of this deposit as a satellite to our Bogoso/Prestea property is scheduled to begin in late 2006. Prestea Underground - The Prestea Underground is located directly beneath the Prestea property. It consists of a large underground gold mine that operated for over 100 years, under a number of former owners, producing a total of approximately nine million ounces of gold prior to its closure in early 2002. We are continuing to conduct exploration and development drilling and carry out engineering, geological and economic analysis of the mine to determine if it can be reopened on a profitable basis. The mine includes several useable shafts and several kilometers of underground workings on numerous levels extending as deep as 1,400 meters below the surface. Wassa Property- We own and operate the Wassa gold mine in southwest Ghana. The mine includes an open-pit mine, a CIL processing plant, a fleet of mining equipment, ancillary facilities including an administration building, a warehouse, a maintenance shop, a stand-by power generating facility and a residential site with associated facilities. The new Wassa processing plant was completed in early 2005 and placed in service on April 1, 2005. Wassa's 2005 gold production and operating costs are shown on the "Gold Production and Unit Costs" table below. St. Jude Properties - The St. Jude Properties consist of the Hwini-Butre and Benso concessions containing undeveloped zones of gold mineralization and which together cover an area of 201 square kilometers. These two properties are located between 60 and 85 kilometers south of our Wassa mine. Prior to being acquired by us, St. Jude conducted extensive exploration work at the St. Jude Properties, and based on our review of this past work we estimated a measured and indicated gold resource of approximately 5.3 million tonnes at an average grade of 4.56 g/t. 14 Rosebel Participation Right - Through our 53% owned subsidiary EURO, we own a participation right referred to as the "Rosebel Royalty." This royalty is paid to our subsidiary by Cambior Inc., operator of the Rosebel gold mine in Suriname. Royalty income totaled $4.7 million in 2005 and $3.0 million in 2004. Exploration Assets - We have interests in numerous gold exploration properties in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso, Niger, French Guiana, Suriname and in other areas of South America. GOLD PRODUCTION AND UNIT COSTS The following table shows historical and projected gold production and unit costs. 2006 Production and Cost Per Ounce (1) 2003 2004 2005 Projected - ------------------------------------------------------ ---- ---- ---- --------- BOGOSO/PRESTEA Ounces (thousands) 174.3 147.9 131.9 180.0 Cash Operating Cost ($/oz) 166 250 338 330 Total Cash Cost ($/oz) 184 264 351 344 Total Operating Cost ($/oz) 216 350 423 420 WASSA(3) Ounces (thousands) - - 69.1 120.0 Cash Operating Cost ($/oz) - - 468 340 Total Cash Cost ($/oz) - - 482 354 Total Operating Cost ($/oz) - - 587 420 CONSOLIDATED Consolidated Total Ounces(2) (thousands) 174.3 147.9 201.0 300.0 Consolidated Cash Operating Cost ($/oz) 166 250 383 335 Consolidated Total Cash Cost ($/oz) 184 264 396 348 Consolidated Total Operating Cost ($/oz) 216 350 479 420 (1) See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for definitions of the cost per ounce measures as used in this table. (2) Gold production is shown on a 100% basis, which represents our current beneficial interest in gold production and revenues. The Government of Ghana, which has a 10% carried interest in Bogoso/Prestea and Wassa, would receive 10% of any dividends distributed from Bogoso/Prestea and Wassa once all of the capital has been repaid. (3) Wassa's 2005 production figures are for the nine-month period following its April 1, 2005 in-service date. MINERAL RESERVES Our proven and probable Mineral Reserves are estimated in conformance with definitions set out in NI 43-101. Technical Reports on our Mineral Reserves for Bogoso/Prestea and Wassa have been filed as required by NI 43-101. The proven and probable Mineral Reserves are those ore tonnages contained within economically optimized pits, configured using current and predicted mining and processing methods and related operating costs and performance parameters. We believe that our Mineral Reserves are calculated on a basis consistent with the definition of proven and probable mineral reserves prescribed for use in the US by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and set forth in SEC Industry Guide 7. See our "Glossary of Terms." We prepare our estimates of Mineral Reserves based on information compiled and/or validated by Mr. William Tanaka, our employee, who holds the position of Group Reserves Manager. Mr. Tanaka is a qualified geological engineer with 20 years of experience and is a member of the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. Mr. Tanaka is considered a qualified person under NI 43-101. 15 The proven and probable Mineral Reserves as of December 31, 2005 have been estimated at an economic cut-off grade based on a gold price of $400 per ounce, which approximately equates to the three year-rolling average gold price. This compares to $360 per ounce used for the estimate of our Mineral Reserves at December 31, 2004. The cut-off grade defines reserve material that is demonstrated to be technically and economically feasible to extract. In determining reserves, we first design an economically optimized pit based on all operating costs, including the costs to mine. Since all material lying within the optimized pit shell will be mined, the cut-off grade used in determining our reserves is calculated on the basis of material that, having been mined, is economic to transport and process without regard to primary mining costs (i.e. mining costs that were appropriately applied at the economic optimization stage). The QA/QC controls program used in connection with the estimation of our reserves consists of regular insertion and analysis of blanks and standards to monitor laboratory performance. Blanks are used to check for contamination. Standards are used to check for grade-dependence biases. A total of eleven standards are used, five generated by Golden Star ranging from 0.24 to 4.55 g/t and six commercially available standards ranging from 0.22 to 3.42 g/t. The following table summarizes our estimated proven and probable Mineral Reserves as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004: 16 PROVEN AND PROBABLE MINERAL RESERVES As of December 31, 2005 As of December 31, 2004 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Property Tonnes Gold Grade Ounces Tonnes Gold Grade Ounces Mineral Reserve Category (millions) (g/t) (millions) (millions) (g/t) (millions) - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bogoso/Prestea Proven Mineral Reserves: Non-refractory 1.9 3.82 0.23 3.0 4.20 0.41 Refractory 13.0 3.00 1.25 11.4 2.97 1.09 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 14.9 3.11 1.48 14.5 3.23 1.51 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Probable Mineral Reserves: Non-refractory 7.0 2.26 0.51 7.3 2.34 0.55 Refractory 11.4 2.42 0.89 9.0 2.60 0.76 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 18.4 2.36 1.40 16.4 2.48 1.31 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Proven and Probable: Non-refractory 8.9 2.59 0.74 10.4 2.89 0.96 Refractory 24.4 2.73 2.14 20.5 2.81 1.85 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Bogoso/Prestea Proven and Probable 33.3 2.69 2.88 30.9 2.83 2.81 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mampon Probable Mineral Reserves: Non-refractory 1.0 3.54 0.12 0.3 4.63 0.04 Refractory 0.5 6.37 0.11 0.7 5.35 0.12 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Mampon Probable 1.5 4.53 0.23 1.0 5.16 0.16 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Wassa Probable Mineral Reserves: Non-refractory 21.9 1.34 0.94 19.3 1.31 0.81 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Wassa Probable 21.9 1.34 0.94 19.3 1.31 0.81 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Proven Mineral Reserves: Non-refractory 1.9 3.82 0.23 3.0 4.20 0.41 Refractory 13.0 3.00 1.25 11.5 2.97 1.09 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 14.9 3.11 1.48 14.5 3.23 1.51 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Probable Mineral Reserves: Non-refractory 30.0 2.26 1.57 26.9 1.62 1.40 Refractory 11.9 2.42 1.00 9.7 2.60 0.88 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 41.9 1.90 2.57 36.6 1.94 2.28 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Proven and Probable: Non-refractory 31.9 2.59 1.80 29.9 1.89 1.82 Refractory 24.9 2.73 2.25 21.2 2.89 1.97 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Proven and Probable 56.8 2.22 4.05 51.1 2.30 3.78 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) The terms "non-refractory" and "refractory" refer to the ore type and are defined in the Glossary of Terms. We plan to process the refractory ore in our BIOX(R) bio-oxidation plant that is currently being constructed at Bogoso and to process the non-refractory ore using more traditional gravity, flotation and/or cyanidation techniques in our existing processing plants at Bogoso and Wassa. (2) Mineral Reserves are expressed on a 100% basis. Golden Star's share of the Mineral Reserves is subject to the Government of Ghana's 10% carried interest which entitles them to a 10% dividend once our capital costs have been recovered. 17 Stockpiled Ores Included in Bogoso/Prestea's proven and probable Mineral Reserves at year-end 2005 and 2004 are stockpiled ores of 0.4 and 0.3 million tonnes at an average grade of 2.42 g/t and 2.67 g/t, respectively. Ounces in stockpiles at Wassa were nil at the end of 2005. The table below summarizes the Bogoso/Prestea stockpiled ores. - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- STOCKPILES INCLUDED IN RESERVES As of December 31, 2005 As of December 31, 2004 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Property Tonnes Gold Grade Ounces Tonnes Gold Grade Ounces Mineral Reserves Category (millions) (g/t) (millions) (millions) (g/t) (millions) - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bogoso/Prestea Proven Stockpiles: Non-refractory 0.20 2.39 0.02 0.1 2.74 0.01 Refractory 0.16 2.44 0.01 0.2 2.64 0.02 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Proven Stockpiles 0.36 2.42 0.03 0.3 2.69 0.03 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reconciliation of Mineral Reserves as shown under NI 43-101 and under SEC Industry Guide 7 Since we report our Mineral Reserves to both NI 43-101 and SEC Industry Guide 7 standards, it is possible for our reserve figures to vary between the two. Where such a variance occurs it will arise from the differing requirements for reporting Mineral Reserves. For example, NI 43-101 has a minimum requirement that reserves be supported by a pre-feasibility study, whereas Industry Guide 7 requires support from a detailed feasibility study that demonstrates that economic extraction is justified. For the Mineral Reserves at December 31, 2005 and 2004, there is no difference between the Mineral Reserves as disclosed under NI 43-101 and those disclosed under Industry Guide 7, and therefore we do not provide reconciliation.

(2) Increases and decreases in Mineral Reserves can result from the discovery of new mineralization, conversion of Non-Reserve Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves, and changes in price assumptions, unit costs and recoveries or any combination of these factors. The increases in Mineral Reserves during 2005 were due primarily to the results of exploration at Bogoso/Prestea and Wassa, and an increase to $400 per ounce from $360 per ounce in the estimated gold price used to calculate Mineral Reserves. NON-RESERVES - MEASURED AND INDICATED MINERAL RESOURCES Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources 18 Cautionary Note to US Investors concerning estimates of Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources This section uses the terms "measured Mineral Resources" and "indicated Mineral Resources." We advise US investors that while those terms are recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the US Securities and Exchange Commission does not recognize them. US investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into mineral reserves. Our measured and indicated Mineral Resources which are reported in this Form 10-K do not include that part of our Mineral Resources that have been converted to proven and probable Mineral Reserves as shown above, and have been estimated in conformance with definitions set out in NI 43-101. We have filed Technical Reports on our Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources (Mineral Resources stated in the Technical Reports include Mineral Reserves) for Bogoso/Prestea and Wassa as required by NI 43-101. See our "Glossary of Terms." The total measured and indicated Mineral Resources for our properties have been estimated at an economic cut-off grade based on a gold price of $480 per ounce for December 31, 2005 and $430 per ounce for December 31, 2004 and on economic constraints that we consider are realistic. The economic cut-off grades for resources are higher than those for reserves and are indicative of the fact that the resource estimates include material that may become economic under more favorable conditions including increases in gold price.

NON-RESERVES - INFERRED MINERAL RESOURCES Inferred Mineral Resources Cautionary Note to US Investors concerning estimates of Inferred Mineral Resources This section uses the term "inferred Mineral Resources." We advise US investors that while this term is recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the US Securities and Exchange Commission does not recognize it. "Inferred Mineral Resources" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of inferred Mineral Resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category. In accordance with Canadian rules, estimates of inferred Mineral Resources cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies. US investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of the inferred Mineral Resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable. 19 Our inferred Mineral Resources which are reported in this Form 10-K do not include that part of the Mineral Resources converted to proven and probable Mineral Reserves or measured and indicated Mineral Resources as shown above, and have been estimated in conformance with definitions set out in NI 43-101. We have filed Technical Reports on our Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources (Mineral Resources stated in the Technical Reports include Mineral Reserves) for Bogoso/Prestea and Wassa as required by NI 43-101. See our "Glossary of Terms." The inferred Mineral Resources for our properties have been estimated at economic cut-off grades based on gold prices of $480 and $430 per ounce as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively, and economic constraints that we consider are realistic. The following table summarizes our estimated non-reserves - inferred Mineral Resources as of December 31, 2005 as compared to the total for December 31, 2004: - ------------------------ ------------------------------- Inferred Property ------------------------------- Tonnes Gold Grade (millions) (g/t) - ------------------------ --------------- --------------- Bogoso/Prestea 24.5 2.10 Wassa 10.1 1.20 Pampe 0.8 3.76 Benso 0.9 3.57 Hwini-Butre 0.2 3.21 Prestea Underground 6.1 8.14 Goulagou 4.4 1.55 Paul Isnard 8.2 1.78 - ------------------------ --------------- --------------- Total 2005 55.2 2.57 - ------------------------ --------------- --------------- Total 2004 70.4 2.15 - ------------------------ --------------- --------------- Notes to Non-Reserves - Inferred Mineral Resources Table (1) The qualified person for the estimates of the inferred Mineral Resources at all properties except Paul Isnard, is our Exploration Manager, Mr. S. Mitch Wasel. Mr. Wasel is a qualified geologist who has 16 years of experience in gold and base metal exploration and is a member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. The qualified person for the estimates of inferred Mineral Resources at Paul Isnard is Mr. Colin Jones, an independent mineral resources consultant. Mr. Jones is a professional geologist with 22 years of experience. Mr. Jones is a member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. (2) Inferred Mineral Resources are shown on a 100% basis. Golden Star's share of the inferred Mineral Resources shown above for Bogoso/Prestea, Wassa, Pampe, Benso and Hwini-Butre are or will be subject to the Government of Ghana's 10% carried interest which entitles the government to a 10% dividend once our capital costs have been recovered. Inferred Mineral Resources at the Prestea Underground are subject to a Government of Ghana 19% carried interest. Inferred Mineral Resources at Goulagou are subject to the Government of Burkina Faso's 10% carried interest. (3) The Paul Isnard property, located in French Guiana, is owned by EURO, a 53% owned subsidiary. Golden Star has the right to earn a 100% interest in this property pursuant to the terms of a joint venture agreement with EURO. The amount of Inferred Mineral Resource at the Paul Isnard property that might have been removed by illegal mining is not known but could be material. See Risk Factors below. (4) Table may not add due to rounding. EMPLOYEES 20 As of December 31, 2005, Golden Star, including our majority-owned subsidiaries, had approximately 1,500 employees and contract employees, a 30% increase from the approximately 1,150 people employed at the end of 2004. Employees hired during 2005 at our new Wassa operations made up most of the increase. The 2005 total includes 12 employees and one contract employee at our principal office in Littleton, Colorado, four employees and one contract employee in Delta, British Columbia and three people in South America. CUSTOMERS Currently all our gold production is sold to a South African gold refinery in accordance with a long-term contract. We receive payment for gold sold approximately five working days after the gold leaves the mine site. We recognize revenue when title passes to the buyer which occurs upon delivery to the refinery, unless we decide to retain title and hold the gold as inventory. During 2005 we sold all of the gold shipped, retaining no inventory of saleable dore bars. The global gold market is competitive with numerous banks and refineries willing to buy gold on short notice, therefore we believe that the loss of our current customer would not materially delay or disrupt revenues. COMPETITION Our competitive position depends upon our ability to successfully and economically explore, acquire and develop new and existing mineral properties. Factors that allow producers to remain competitive in the market over the long term include the quality and size of ore bodies, costs of operation, and the acquisition and retention of qualified employees. We compete with other mining companies and other natural mineral resource companies in the acquisition, exploration, financing and development of new mineral properties. Many of these companies are larger and better capitalized than we are. There is significant competition for the limited number of gold acquisition and exploration opportunities. We also compete with other mining companies for skilled mining engineers, mine and processing plant operators and mechanics, geologists, geophysicists and other technical personnel. This could result in higher turnover and greater labor costs.

RISK FACTORS RISK FACTORS You should consider the following discussion of risks in addition to the other information contained in or included by reference in this Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the information in this form 10-K contains "forward-looking" statements about our future business and performance. Our actual operating results and financial performance may be very different from what we expect as of the date of this Form 10-K. The risks below address material factors that may affect our future operating results and financial performance. FINANCIAL RISKS A substantial or prolonged decline in gold prices would have a material adverse effect on us. The price of our common shares, our financial results and our exploration, development and mining activities have previously been, and would in the future be, significantly adversely affected by a substantial or prolonged decline in the price of gold. The price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation or deflation, fluctuation in the value of the United States dollar and foreign currencies, global and regional demand, and the political and economic conditions of major gold-producing countries throughout the world. Any drop in the price of gold adversely impacts our revenues, profits and cash flows. In particular, a sustained low gold price could: 21 o cause suspension of our mining operations at Bogoso/Prestea and Wassa if such operations become uneconomic at the then-prevailing gold price, thus further reducing revenues; o cause us to be unable to fulfill our obligations under agreements with our partners or under our permits and licenses which could cause us to lose our interests in, or be forced to sell, some of our properties; o cause us to be unable to fulfill our debt payment obligations; o halt or delay the development of new projects; o reduce funds available for exploration, with the result that depleted reserves are not replaced; and o reduce or eliminate the benefit of enhanced growth opportunities anticipated from the St. Jude acquisition. Furthermore, the need to reassess the feasibility of any of our projects because of declining gold prices could cause substantial delays or might interrupt operations until the reassessment can be completed. Mineral reserve calculations and life-of-mine plans using significantly lower gold prices could result in reduced estimates of mineral reserves and non-reserve mineral resources and in material write-downs of our investment in mining properties and increased amortization, reclamation and closure charges. We may incur substantial losses in the future that could make financing our operations and business strategy more difficult. We had a net loss of $13.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and annual earnings of $2.6 million, $22.0 million and $4.9 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We reported net losses of $20.6 million in 2001 and $14.9 million in 2000. Numerous factors, including declining gold prices, lower than expected ore grades or higher than expected operating costs (including increased commodity prices), and impairment write-offs of mine property and/or exploration property costs, could cause us to be unprofitable in the future. The acquisition of St. Jude, which has no operating properties, may result in increased future losses. Any future operating losses could make financing our operations and our business strategy, including pursuit of the growth opportunities anticipated as a result of our acquisition of St. Jude, or raising additional capital, difficult or impossible and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Our obligations could strain our financial position and impede our business strategy. We had total consolidated debt and liabilities as of December 31, 2005 of $165.7 million, including $7.6 million payable to banks, $15.8 million in equipment financing loans, $47.7 million in senior convertible notes maturing on April 15, 2009, $26.1 million of current trade payables, accrued current and other liabilities, $45.1 million of future taxes, $12.0 million of derivative liabilities and an $11.4 million accrual for environmental rehabilitation liabilities. We expect that our indebtedness and other liabilities will increase as a result of our corporate development activities. These liabilities could have important consequences, including the following: o increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; o limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, operating and exploration costs and other general corporate requirements; o requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments, which would reduce our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, operating and exploration costs and other general corporate requirements; o limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; and o placing us at a disadvantage when compared to our competitors that have less relative to their market capitalization. Our estimates of mineral reserves could be inaccurate, which could cause production and costs to differ from estimates. Our estimates of non-reserves mineral resources could also be inaccurate. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating proven and probable mineral reserves and non-reserve measured, indicated and inferred mineral resources, including many factors beyond our control. The accuracy of estimates of mineral reserves and non-reserves is a function of the quantity and quality 22 of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation, which could prove to be unreliable. These estimates of mineral reserves and non-reserves may not be accurate, and mineral reserves and non-reserves may not be able to be mined or processed profitably. Fluctuation in gold prices, results of drilling, metallurgical testing and production, and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimate could require revision of the estimates. The volume and grade of mineral reserves mined and processed and recovery rates might not be the same as currently anticipated. Any material reductions in estimates of our mineral reserves and non-reserves, or of our ability to extract these mineral reserves and non-reserves, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We currently have only two major sources of operational cash flows, which will likely be insufficient by themselves to fund our continuing exploration and development activities. While we have received significant infusions of cash from sales of equity and debt, our only current significant internal sources of funds are operational cash flows from Bogoso/Prestea and Wassa. The newly constructed Wassa processing plant and open pit mine were completed and placed in service on April 1, 2005, and we currently process through the plant a mixture of ore from the open pit and materials from the prior owner's heap leach pads. Production at Wassa was 69,070 ounces during the last nine months of 2005 and is expected to average approximately 120,000 to 130,000 ounces per year after 2005. However, Wassa's production goal may not be achieved. The anticipated continuing exploration and development of our properties will require significant expenditures over the next several years, which we expect to increase with the acquisition of St. Jude. We expect that these expenditures will exceed free cash flows generated by Bogoso/Prestea and Wassa during 2006 and possibly in later years and therefore we expect in the future to require additional external debt or equity financing. Lower gold prices during the five years prior to 2002 adversely affected our ability to obtain financing, and recurring lower gold prices could have similar effects in the future. In the future, we may not be able to obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, we might need to delay or indefinitely postpone further exploration and development of our properties, and as a result, we could lose our interest in, or could be forced to sell, some of our properties. Implementation of a gold hedging program might be unsuccessful and incur losses. EURO Ressources S.A., our 53% owned subsidiary, has entered into a cash-settled forward gold price agreement with its lender designed to reduce in part the impact of gold price fluctuations on expected future Rosebel royalty revenues it receives from Cambior Inc., as required by its loan agreement. While there is a risk of loss if the derivative positions were to be liquidated early and during a period of unfavorable gold prices, loan covenants prohibit liquidation of the position prior to the end of the loan repayment. Also, while the derivatives EURO has entered into are economically effective, accounting for the derivatives on a mark-to-market basis could show large swings in any period as any unrealized, non-cash losses/gains are recognized through the statement of operations. We have purchased and may continue to purchase put options ("puts") and sell call options ("calls") from time to time during the construction phase of the new processing plant at Bogoso in Ghana. Puts give us the right but not the obligation to sell gold in the future at a fixed price. Calls are contractual commitments which require us to sell gold at a fixed price on specified future dates. If the spot market gold price exceeds the call option price on the specified sale date we would receive the call price rather than the higher spot market price for the gold ounces covered by the call option. Our call options are set at $525 per ounce. There will be no cost to us unless the spot market price of gold exceeds this level on the call options' specified sales dates. Of our 2006 production, approximately 17% is subject to calls at $525 per ounce, and approximately 50% is protected by puts at a floor price of $406 per ounce. We continue to review whether or not, in light of the potential for gold prices to fall, it would be appropriate to establish a more general hedging program. To date, we have decided not to implement a more general hedging program on gold production from our own properties. We are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could materially adversely affect our financial position. Our revenues are in United States dollars, and we maintain most of our working capital in United States dollars or United States dollar-denominated securities. We typically convert our United States funds to foreign currencies as payment obligations become due. Accordingly, we are subject to fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the United States dollar and these foreign 23 currencies, and these fluctuations could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. A significant portion of the operating costs at Bogoso/Prestea and Wassa is based on the Ghanaian currency, the Cedi. We are required to convert into Cedis only 20% of the foreign exchange proceeds that we receive from selling gold, but the Government of Ghana could require us to convert a higher percentage of gold sales proceeds into Cedis in the future. In addition, we currently have future obligations that are payable in South African Rand and Euros, and receivables collectible in Euros. We obtain construction and other services and materials and supplies from providers in South Africa and other countries. The costs of goods and services could increase due to changes in the value of the United States dollar or the Cedi, Euros, the South African Rand or other currencies, such as the recent cost increase due to the decrease in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies. Consequently, operation and development of our properties might be more costly than we anticipate. We have purchased, and expect to continue to purchase South African Rand and Euro forward contracts to hedge the expected purchase of capital assets in South Africa and Europe in connection with the Bogoso sulfide expansion project. We may engage in additional currency hedges in the future in connection with other projects. Implementation of a currency hedging program may not adequately protect us from the effects of fluctuation in currency exchange rates. Risks inherent in acquisitions that we might undertake could adversely affect our current business and financial condition and our growth. We plan to continue to pursue the acquisition of producing, development and advanced stage exploration properties and companies, and we have recently completed the acquisition and joint venture of exploration and development properties in Ghana and Sierra Leone and the acquisition of St. Jude on December 21, 2005. The search for attractive acquisition opportunities and the completion of suitable transactions are time consuming and expensive, divert management attention from our existing business and may be unsuccessful. Our success in our acquisition activities depends on our ability to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms and integrate the acquired operations successfully with those of Golden Star. Any acquisition would be accompanied by risks. For example, there may be a significant change in commodity prices after we have committed to complete a transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio, a material ore body may prove to be below expectations or the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant. We may lose the services of our key employees or the key employees of any business we acquire or have difficulty integrating operations and personnel. The integration of an acquired business or assets may disrupt our ongoing business and our relationships with employees, suppliers and contractors. Any one or more of these factors or other risks could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition of properties or companies, and could have a material adverse effect on our current business and financial condition and on our ability to grow. We are subject to litigation risks All industries, including the mining industry, are subject to legal claims, with and without merit. We are involved in various routine legal proceedings, which include labor matters such as unfair termination claims, supplier matters and property issues incidental to our business. Defense and settlement costs can be substantial, even with respect to claims that have no merit. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal proceeding could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. OPERATIONAL RISKS The technology, capital costs and cost of production of refractory mineral reserves and non-reserves at Bogoso/Prestea remain subject to a number of uncertainties, including funding uncertainties. Based upon the completion of our Bogoso sulfide project feasibility studies in 2001 and 2005, the refractory material at Bogoso/Prestea has been included in our proven and probable mineral reserves, which are prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 of the Canadian securities regulators. While the sulfide project feasibility study indicated that refractory mineral reserves can be profitably mined and processed at current gold prices, the capital cost to construct a new bio-oxidation or BIOX(R) plant at Bogoso to process refractory ore, together with related mining equipment and facilities, is significant, and is forecast to be $125 million, of which approximately $36 million had been spent on the project through December 31, 2005. While the processing technology envisioned in the feasibility study has been successfully utilized at other mines, and despite our testing, engineering and analysis, the technology may not perform successfully at commercial production levels on the Bogoso/Prestea refractory sulfide ores, in which case our production estimates may not be achieved. 24 The integration of Golden Star and St. Jude may not occur as planned. We have only recently begun the process of integrating the operations of Golden Star and St. Jude. The acquisition of St. Jude was proposed with the expectation that its successful completion would over time result in enhanced growth opportunities and the synergies resulting from the combination of increased earnings and reduced costs. These anticipated benefits depend in part on whether the operations of Golden Star and St. Jude can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner and whether the St. Jude Properties can be developed. If these do not occur, the benefits we receive from the acquisition will be significantly less than anticipated. Most operational and certain staffing decisions with respect to the combined company have not yet been made. These decisions and the integration of the two companies will present challenges to management, including the integration of systems and personnel of the two companies, and special risks, including possible unanticipated liabilities and costs. We are subject to a number of operational hazards that can delay production or result in liability to us. Our activities are subject to a number of risks and hazards including: o environmental hazards; o discharge of pollutants or hazardous chemicals; o industrial accidents; o labor disputes and shortages; o supply and shipping problems and delays; o shortage of equipment and contractor availability; o difficulty in applying technology such as bio-oxidation processing; o unusual or unexpected geological or operating conditions; o slope failures; o cave-ins of underground workings; o failure of pit walls or dams; o fire; o marine and transit damage and/or loss; o changes in the regulatory environment; and o natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions, floods and earthquakes. These or other occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in mining, delayed production, monetary losses and possible legal liability. We could incur liabilities as a result of pollution and other casualties. Satisfying such liabilities could be very costly and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Our mining operations are subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations and permitting requirements that can delay production and adversely affect operating and development costs. Compliance with existing regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to environmental protection, in the jurisdictions where we have projects may have a material adverse effect on our exploration activities, results of operations and competitive position. New or expanded regulations, if adopted, could affect the exploration or development of our projects or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations. 25 A significant portion of our Dunkwa property and portions of our Wassa property, as well as some of our exploration properties in Ghana, are located within forest reserve areas. Although Dunkwa and Wassa have been identified by the Government of Ghana as eligible for mining permits subject to normal procedures and a site inspection, permits for projects in forest reserve areas may not be issued in a timely fashion, or at all, and such permits may contain special requirements with which it is burdensome or expensive to comply. Mining and processing gold from the south end of the Prestea property, the new tailings dam at Bogoso and other activities will require mining and other permits from the Government of Ghana. These permits may not be issued on a timely basis or at all, and such permits, when issued, may be subject to requirements or conditions with which it is burdensome or expensive to comply. Such permitting issues could adversely affect our projected production commencement dates, production amounts and costs. Due to an increased level of non-governmental organization activity targeting the mining industry in Ghana, the potential for the Government of Ghana to delay the issuance of permits or impose new requirements or conditions upon mining operations in Ghana may be increased. Any changes in the Government of Ghana's policies may be costly to comply with and may delay mining operations. The exact nature of other environmental control problems, if any, which we may encounter in the future cannot be predicted, primarily because of the changing character of environmental requirements that may be enacted within various jurisdictions. To the extent that we are subject to any such changes, they may have a material adverse effect on our operations. As a result of the foregoing risks, project expenditures, production quantities and rates and cash operating costs, among other things, could be materially and adversely affected and could differ materially from anticipated expenditures, production quantities and rates, and costs. In addition, estimated production dates could be delayed materially. Any such events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The development and operation of our mining projects involve numerous uncertainties that could affect the feasibility or profitability of such projects. Mine development projects, including our recent development at Wassa and expansion at Bogoso/Prestea, and the potential development of any of the St. Jude Properties if reserves are established, typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible. Development projects are subject to the completion of successful feasibility studies and environmental assessments, issuance of necessary governmental permits and receipt of adequate financing. The economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors such as: o estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources; o anticipated metallurgical recovery rates; o environmental considerations and permitting; o future gold prices; and o anticipated capital and operating costs. Our mine development projects could have limited relevant operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves and operating costs determined in feasibility studies are based on geologic and engineering analyses and might not prove to be accurate. The management of mine development projects and start up of new operations are complex, and we do not have a history of simultaneously managing an ongoing operation, the start-up of a new operation and a significant development project. Completion of development and the commencement of production may be subject to delays, as occurred at Wassa. Any of the following events, among others, could affect the profitability or economic feasibility of a project: o unanticipated changes in grade and tonnage of ore to be mined and processed; o unanticipated adverse geotechnical conditions; 26 o incorrect data on which engineering assumptions are made; o costs of constructing and operating a mine in a specific environment; o availability and cost of processing and refining facilities; o availability of economic sources of power; o adequacy of water supply; o adequate access to the site including competing land uses (such as agriculture and illegal mining); o unanticipated transportation costs and shipping incidents and losses; o significant increases in the cost of diesel fuel, cyanide or other major components of operating costs; o government regulations (including regulations relating to prices, royalties, duties, taxes, permitting, restrictions on production, quotas on exportation of minerals, as well as the costs of protection of the environment and agricultural lands); o fluctuations in gold prices; and o accidents, labor actions and force majeure events. Adverse effects on the operations or further development of a project could also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Because of these uncertainties, and others identified in these "Risk Factors," our production estimates at Bogoso/Prestea and Wassa may not be achieved. We need to continually discover, develop or acquire additional mineral reserves for gold production and a failure to do so would adversely affect our business and financial position in the future. Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable mineral reserves, we must continually replace and expand our mineral reserves as our mines produce gold. At current average production rates, we estimate that Bogoso/Prestea has about ten years of mine life and Wassa has about five years of mine life, but our estimates might not be correct and the mine life would be shortened if we expand production. Our ability to maintain or increase our annual production of gold will be dependent in significant part on our ability to bring new mines into production and to expand or extend the life of existing mines. Gold exploration is highly speculative, involves substantial expenditures, and is frequently non-productive. Gold exploration, including the exploration of the Prestea Underground and the St. Jude Properties and other projects, involves a high degree of risk and exploration projects are frequently unsuccessful. Few prospects that are explored end up being ultimately developed into producing mines. To the extent that we continue to be involved in gold exploration, the long-term success of our operations will be related to the cost and success of our exploration programs. We cannot assure you that our gold exploration efforts will be successful. The success of gold exploration is determined in part on the following factors: o the identification of potential gold mineralization based on superficial analysis; o availability of prospective land; o availability of government-granted exploration and exploitation permits; o the quality of our management and our geological and technical expertise; and o the capital available for exploration and development. Substantial expenditures are required to determine if a project has economically mineable mineralization. It could take several years to establish proven and probable mineral reserves and to develop and construct mining and processing facilities. As a result of these uncertainties, we cannot assure you that current and future exploration programs will result in the discovery of mineral reserves, the expansion of our existing mineral reserves and the development of mines. 27 We face competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties. We face strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing, or capable of producing, precious metals. Many of these companies have greater financial resources, operational experience and technical capabilities. As a result of this competition, we might be unable to maintain or acquire attractive mining properties on terms we consider acceptable or at all. Consequently, our revenues, operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Title to our mineral properties could be challenged. We seek to confirm the validity of our rights to title to, or contract rights with respect to, each mineral property in which we have a material interest. We have mining leases with respect to our Bogoso/Prestea, Wassa and Prestea Underground properties. However, we cannot guarantee that title to our properties will not be challenged. Title insurance generally is not available, and our ability to ensure that we have obtained a secure claim to individual mineral properties or mining concessions could be severely constrained. We generally do not conduct surveys of our properties until they have reached the development stage, and therefore, the precise area and location of such properties could be in doubt. Accordingly, our mineral properties could be subject to prior unregistered agreements, transfers or claims, and title could be affected by, among other things, undetected defects. In addition, we might be unable to operate our properties as permitted or to enforce our rights with respect to our properties. We depend on the services of key executives. We are dependent on the services of key executives including our President and Chief Executive Officer and a small number of highly skilled and experienced executives and personnel. Due to the relatively small size of our management team, the loss of these persons or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees could adversely affect the exploration and development of our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and future operations. We have obtained key person insurance only with respect to our President and Chief Executive Officer. The period of weak gold prices prior to 2002 resulted in depletion of the number of trained and experienced professionals and managers in our industry. Higher gold prices have resulted in an increased demand for these people, and it could therefore be more difficult to attract or retain such experienced professionals and managers without significantly increasing the cost to us. Our insurance coverage could be insufficient. Our business is subject to a number of risks and hazards generally, including: o adverse environmental conditions; o industrial accidents; o labor disputes; o unusual or unexpected geological conditions; o ground or slope failures; o cave-ins; o changes in the regulatory environment; o marine transit and shipping damage and/or losses; o natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions, floods and earthquakes; and o political risks including expropriation and civil war. Such occurrences could result in: o damage to mineral properties or production facilities; 28 o personal injury or death; o loss of legitimate title to properties; o environmental damage to our properties or the properties of others; o delays in mining, processing and development; o monetary losses; and o possible legal liability. Although we maintain insurance in amounts that we believe to be reasonable, our insurance might not cover all the potential risks associated with our business. We might also be unable to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums. Insurance coverage might not continue to be available or might not be adequate to cover any resulting liability. Moreover, insurance against risks such as environmental pollution or other hazards as a result of exploration and production is not generally available to us or to other companies in the mining industry on acceptable terms. We might also become subject to liability for pollution or other hazards which we cannot insure against or which we might elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons. Losses from these events might cause us to incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance and results of operations. In addition, as of the completion of the Arrangement with St. Jude, our insurance policies do not cover St. Jude and its properties, and we may not be able to obtain insurance to cover St. Jude and its properties at economically feasible premiums or at all. GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY RISKS As a holding company, limitations on the ability of our operating subsidiaries to make distributions to us could adversely affect the funding of our operations. We are a holding company that conducts operations through foreign (principally African) subsidiaries and joint ventures, and substantially all of our assets consist of equity in these entities. Accordingly, any limitation on the transfer of cash or other assets between the parent corporation and these entities, or among these entities, could restrict our ability to fund our operations efficiently, or to repay our convertible notes or other debt. Any such limitations, or the perception that such limitations might exist now or in the future, could have an adverse impact on available credit and our valuation and stock price. We are subject to changes in the regulatory environment where we operate which may increase our costs of compliance. Our mining operations and exploration activities are subject to extensive regulation governing various matters, including: o licensing; o production; o taxes; o disposal of process water or waste rock; o toxic substances; o development and permitting; o exports; o imports; o labor standards; o occupational health and safety; 29 o mine safety; and o environmental protections; Compliance with these regulations increases the costs of the following: o planning; o designing; o drilling; o operating; o developing; o constructing; and o closure and reclamation. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations in Ghana and elsewhere. However, these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and reinterpretation. Due to the substantial increase in mining development in Ghana in recent years, the Government of Ghana has been reviewing the adequacy of reclamation bonds and guarantees throughout the country and in some cases has requested higher levels of bonding than previously had been required. Our bonds may be increased. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities of mining companies or more stringent implementation or interpretation of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on us, cause a reduction in levels of production and delay or prevent the development or expansion of our properties in Ghana. Government regulations limit the proceeds from gold sales that could be withdrawn from Ghana. Changes in regulations that increase these restrictions could have a material adverse impact on us, as Bogoso/Prestea and Wassa are currently our only sources of internally generated operating cash flows. The Government of Ghana has the right to increase its ownership and control of certain subsidiaries. The Government of Ghana is entitled to a 10% carried interest in gold properties in Ghana. The carried interest comes into existence at the time the government issues a mining license. As such, the Government of Ghana currently has a 10% carried interest in our subsidiaries that own the Bogoso Prestea mine, the Wassa mine and a 19% carried interest in the Prestea Underground property in Ghana. The Government of Ghana also has: (a) the right under the current mining law to acquire up to an additional 20% equity interest in each of these subsidiaries for a price to be determined by agreement or arbitration (although this right does not exist in the new Minerals and Mining Bill which is expected to receive Presidential assent in 2006); (b) the right to acquire a special share or "golden share" in such subsidiaries at any time for no consideration or such consideration as the Government of Ghana and such subsidiaries might agree; and (c) a pre-emptive right to purchase all gold and other minerals produced by such subsidiaries. The Government of Ghana may seek to exercise one or more of these rights, which could reduce our equity interest. A reduction in our equity interest could reduce our income or cash flows from Bogoso/Prestea or Wassa, reducing amounts available to us for reinvestment and adversely affecting our ability to take certain actions. We are subject to risks relating to exploration, development and operations in foreign countries. Certain laws, regulations and statutory provisions in certain countries in which we have mineral rights could, as they are currently written, have a material negative impact on our ability to develop or operate a commercial mine. For countries where we have exploration or development stage projects, we intend to negotiate mineral agreements with the governments of these countries and seek variances or otherwise be exempted from the provisions of these laws, regulations and/or statutory provisions. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be successful in obtaining mineral agreements or variances or exemptions on commercially acceptable terms. In addition, our assets and operations are affected by various political and economic uncertainties, including: o the risks of war, civil unrest, coups or other violent or unexpected changes in government; 30 o political instability and violence; o expropriation and nationalization; o renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions, licenses, permits, and contracts; o illegal mining; o changes in taxation policies; o restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation; and o changing political conditions, currency controls, and governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. Illegal mining occurs on our properties, is difficult to control, can disrupt our business and can expose us to liability. We continue to experience significant illegal mining activity on our Bogoso/Prestea property involving illegal miners numbering in the thousands. Most of this activity is close to our Plant-North pit and planned Bogoso North and Beta Boundary pit areas and includes areas where we have established reserves. It is difficult to quantify the exact impact of this activity on our reserves and non-reserve mineral resources. The impact of this illegal mining, to the extent known at this time, on our currently reported Mineral Reserves and Non-Reserve Mineral Resources, has been reflected in our year-end 2005 reserve figures. While we are proactively working with local, regional and national governmental authorities to obtain protection of our property rights on a timelier basis, any action on the part of such authorities may not occur, may not fully address our problems or may be delayed. In addition to the impact on our mineral reserve and non reserve mineral resources, the presence of illegal miners could lead to project delays and disputes and delays regarding the development or operation of commercial gold deposits. The work performed by the illegal miners could cause environmental damage or other damage to our properties, or personal injury or death for which we could potentially be held responsible. Illegal miners work on other of our properties from time to time, including on the Paul Isnard property in French Guiana, and they may in the future increase their presence and have increased negative impacts such as those described above on such other properties. Our activities are subject to complex laws, regulations and accounting standards that can adversely affect operating and development costs, the timing of operations, the ability to operate and financial results. Our business, mining operations and exploration and development activities are subject to extensive Canadian, United States, Ghanaian and other foreign, federal, state, provincial, territorial and local laws and regulations governing exploration, development, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, waste disposal, protection of the environment, reclamation, historic and cultural resource preservation, mine safety and occupational health, toxic substances, reporting and other matters, as well as accounting standards. Compliance with these laws, regulations and standards or the imposition of new such requirements could adversely affect operating and development costs, the timing of operations, the ability to operate and financial results. We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; failure in the future to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price. We are required to annually test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditor addressing these assessments. In connection with management's assessments for the year ended December 31, 2005, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to not maintaining appropriate documentation to support the use of hedge accounting in our subsidiary, EURO Ressources S.A. We determined that Golden Star did not have the necessary controls in place to properly identify the lack of documentation, which was necessary to properly evaluate the derivative instruments to determine if hedge accounting was appropriate. As a result of this, management has concluded that, for the year ended December 31, 2005, Golden Star did not maintain effective control over financial reporting. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an adverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. 31 The treatment of the EURO derivative contracts has been properly reflected in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we plan to restate our consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2005 to reflect such change in accounting treatment. We have taken steps to remediate the material weakness discussed above; however failure in the future to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price. MARKET RISKS The market price of our common shares could experience volatility and could decline significantly. Our common shares are listed on the American Stock Exchange ("AMEX") and the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX"). Securities of small-cap companies have experienced substantial volatility in the past, often based on factors unrelated to the financial performance or prospects of the companies involved. These factors include macroeconomic developments in North America and globally and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries. Our share price is also likely to be significantly affected by short-term changes in gold prices or in our financial condition or results of operations as reflected in our quarterly earnings reports. Other factors unrelated to our performance that could have an effect on the price of our common shares include the following: o the extent of analytical coverage available to investors concerning our business could be limited if investment banks with research capabilities do not continue to follow our securities; o the trading volume and general market interest in our securities could affect an investor's ability to trade significant numbers of common shares; o the size of the public float in our common shares may limit the ability of some institutions to invest in our securities; and o a substantial decline in our stock price that persists for a significant period of time could cause our securities to be delisted from the AMEX and the TSX, further reducing market liquidity. As a result of any of these factors, the market price of our common shares at any given point in time might not accurately reflect our long-term value. Securities class action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We could in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and damages and divert management's attention and resources. Investors could have difficulty or be unable to enforce certain civil liabilities on us, certain of our directors and our experts. Golden Star is a Canadian corporation. Substantially all of our assets are located outside of Canada and the United States, and our head office is located in the United States. It might not be possible for investors to collect judgments obtained in Canadian courts predicated on the civil liability provisions of Canadian or U.S. securities legislation. It could also be difficult for you to effect service of process in connection with any action brought in the United States upon our directors and experts. Execution by United States courts of any judgment obtained against us or, any of the directors, executive officers or experts named in this report in the United States courts would be limited to our assets or the assets of such persons or corporations, as the case might be, in the United States. The enforceability in Canada of United States judgments or liabilities in original actions in Canadian courts predicated solely upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States is doubtful. There may be certain tax risks associated with investments in Golden Star. Potential investors that are United States taxpayers should consider that we could be considered to be a "passive foreign investment company" ("PFIC") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although we believe that we currently are not a PFIC and do not expect to become a PFIC in the future, the tests for determining PFIC status are dependent upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, and we can not assure you that we would not become a PFIC in the future. If we were deemed to be a PFIC, then a United States taxpayer who disposes of common shares at a gain, or who received a so-called "excess distribution" on the common shares, generally would be required to treat such gain or excess distribution as ordinary income and pay an interest charge on a portion of the gain or distribution. 32 The existence of outstanding rights to purchase or acquire common shares could impair our ability to raise capital. As of March 27, 2006 approximately 18.6 million common shares are issuable on exercise of warrants, options or other rights to purchase common shares (including options and warrants issued in exchange for St. Jude options and warrants) at prices ranging from Cdn$0.29 to Cdn$9.07. In addition, 11.1 million common shares are currently issuable upon conversion of our senior convertible notes issued in April 2005. During the life of the warrants, options, notes and other rights, the holders are given an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of common shares, with a resulting dilution in the interest of the other shareholders. Our ability to obtain additional financing during the period such rights are outstanding could be adversely affected, and the existence of the rights could have an adverse effect on the price of our common shares. The holders of the warrants, options, notes and other rights can be expected to exercise or convert them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital by a new offering of securities on terms more favorable than those provided by the outstanding rights.

Accra, the capital city of Ghana, is located on the Prime Meridian. Following a period as a British colony, Ghana achieved independence in 1957 and it is now a republic with a democratically elected government. Ghana has a population of approximately 21 million people. English is the official and commercial language. The total land area of the country is approximately 238,000 square kilometers and the topography is relatively flat. Ghana has a tropical climate with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year. Rights to explore and develop a mine are administered by the Minister of Mines through the Minerals Commission, a governmental organization designed to promote and control the development of Ghana's mineral wealth in accordance with the current mining law. A company or individual can apply to the Minerals Commission for a renewable exploration concession granting exclusive rights to explore for a particular mineral in a selected area for a period of two years subject to renewal. When exploration has successfully delineated a mineable mineral reserve, an application is made to the Minerals Commission for conversion to a mining lease, granting a company the right to produce a specific product from the concession area, normally for a period of 20 to 30 years. Production must typically begin within two years of the date of grant of a mining lease. An amendment made to the current mining law in 1994 requires that any person who intends to acquire a controlling share of the equity of any mining company that has been granted a mining lease by the Government of Ghana shall first give notice of such intention to the Government and obtain its consent prior to acquiring such controlling share. In accordance with the current mining law, the Government of Ghana is granted a 10% carried interest in all companies such as BGL and WGL that hold mining leases. The 10% carried interest entitles the Government of Ghana to a pro-rata share of future dividends (none have been declared to date), if any, from BGL and WGL once all capital is repaid, and the Government of Ghana has no obligation to contribute development or operating expenses. BGL and WGL owe $142.5 million and $120.6 million, respectively, to Golden Star or its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 for past advances, and these amounts would be repaid to us before payment of any dividends. Under the current mining law the Government of Ghana is entitled to acquire up to an additional 20% interest in our operating companies. If the Government of Ghana wished to exercise this right, it must first give reasonable notice, and pay a mutually agreed price. Under the new Minerals and Mining bill, which will become law when it receives Presidential assent, expected later in 2006, the Government of Ghana would no longer have the right to acquire this additional interest. The Government of Ghana is also entitled to acquire a special or golden share in BGL or WGL or any mining company at any time for no consideration or such consideration as the Government of Ghana and BGL or WGL might agree. The special share would constitute a separate class of shares with such rights as the Government of Ghana and BGL or WGL might agree. In the absence of such agreement, the special share would have the following rights: 37 o the special share would carry no voting rights, but the holder would be entitled to receive notice of and attend and speak at any general meeting of the members or any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares; o the special share could only be issued to, held by, or transferred to the Government or a person acting on behalf of the Government; o the written consent of the holder of the special share would be required for all amendments to the organizational documents of the company, the voluntary winding-up or liquidation of the company or the disposal of any mining lease or the whole or any material part of the assets of the company; and o the holder of the special share would be entitled to the payment of a nominal sum of 1,000 Ghanaian Cedis in a winding-up or liquidation of the company in priority to any payment to other members and could require the company to redeem the special share at any time for a nominal sum of 1,000 Cedis. BGL and WGL have not issued nor to date been requested to issue any such special share to the Government of Ghana. The Government of Ghana has a pre-emptive right to purchase all gold and other minerals produced by BGL and WGL. The purchase price would be agreed by the Government of Ghana and BGL and WGL, or the price established by any gold hedging arrangement between BGL or WGL and any third party approved by the Government, or the publicly quoted market price prevailing for the minerals or products as delivered at the mine or plant where the right of preemption was exercised. The Government of Ghana has agreed to take no preemptive action pursuant to its right to purchase gold or other minerals so long as BGL and WGL sell gold in accordance with certain procedures approved by the Bank of Ghana. The existing legal structure for mining in Ghana has been under review with the intent to make it more competitive and bring it in line with international best practice. To this end the new Minerals and Mining Bill was placed before the Ghanaian parliament in late 2004. After being subjected to public critique by various stakeholders, a revised bill was considered by the Ghanaian Parliament and passed in late December 2005. The new law will come into force when it has been given Presidential assent and gazette notification as required by the Ghana constitution. Based on currently available information, we do not believe that the implementation of the new Bill will have a material impact on our operations in Ghana. Ghanaian Royalty Requirements Under the laws of Ghana, a holder of a mining lease is required to pay quarterly a royalty of not less than 3% per annum and not more than 12% per annum of the total revenues earned from the lease area. Under the new Minerals and Mining Bill, the upper limit on the royalty would be capped at 6%. The Government of Ghana determines the royalty percentage each year based on the ratio that the operating margin bears to the value of gold produced from a mining lease in that year. Based on the Mineral Royalty Regulation of 1987, the royalty is 3% when the operating ratio is 30% or less, the royalty increases 0.225% for each 1% increase in operating ratio until the royalty reaches a maximum of 12% (see above) at an operating ratio of 70%. In 2005, 2004 and 2003 the royalty rate for BGL was 3% of revenues and BGL paid $1.8 million, $1.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively. The royalty payments from BGL have not exceeded 3% per annum in any year. WGL also paid a 3% royalty in 2005 or $0.9 million. Ghanaian Environmental Regulations All environmental matters in Ghana, including those related to mining, fall under the oversight of the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"). The EPA has formulated rules and guidelines which govern environmental impact statements, mine operations, and mine closure and reclamation, to which our operations are subject. In conformance with EPA requirements, we posted reclamation bonds for the Wassa and Bogoso/Prestea properties in 2005. We bonded $3.0 million to cover future reclamation obligations at Wassa comprised of a $2.85 million letter of credit and cash deposit of $0.15 million. We also bonded $9.45 million for Bogoso/Prestea comprised of an $8.55 million letter of credit and $0.9 million of cash. Signed bonding agreements are now in place for both Wassa and Bogoso/Prestea. 38 BGL completed significant work during 1999 to identify the outstanding reclamation liabilities for Bogoso/Prestea and to prepare a rehabilitation work plan. Significant work has been performed since that time to advance this plan and to reduce the outstanding historic reclamation liability. Expenditures for ongoing rehabilitation work, including the capping of sulfide material, back-filling of worked out pits, and the contouring and re-vegetation of waste dumps, were approximately $0.7 million, $0.7 million and $0.8 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. In addition to the bonds detailed above, as at December 31, 2005, BGL still had $3.4 million of restricted cash set aside for environmental reclamation of the Bogoso mine since 1999 when we purchased Bogoso from the International Finance Corporation and a consortium of banks. The Plant-North pit at Prestea has been developed in stages with the development of the final stage (Phase 3) commencing in August 2005. Initiation of Phase 3 mining was conditional on a number of mitigation measures identified in our Environmental Impact Statement. The EPA requested suspension of mining of the Plant-North Phase 3 pit on September 13, 2005 and of the Plant-North pit on September 28, 2005 until certain outstanding mitigation measures were completed. The mitigation measures were completed and inspected by the EPA on October 19, 2005. On November 1, 2005, we received approval from the EPA to recommence mining operations at the Plant-North pit and mining activity was recommenced a few days later following a series of informational meetings with the Prestea community. During the mining suspension at Plant-North, processing operations continued at the Bogoso processing plant using stockpiled ore. Mining and processing operations at the Wassa mine and construction activities on the Bogoso sulfide expansion project also continued without interruption. To our knowledge, all our operations in Ghana are currently in substantial compliance with all environmental requirements. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND SUSTAINABILITY It is our policy and our intent to be a responsible corporate citizen of Ghana and in all other areas where we conduct our business. We believe our success as an employer, as a citizen of the local community and as a participant in the local economy is dependent on achieving and maintaining good community relationships. As such, we strive to accommodate and support local efforts to improve the economic and overall well being of the communities around our operations. Alternative Livelihood and Sustainable Development Program (ALSD) - In mid-2001 we initiated the ALSD program in the Bogoso/Prestea area and expanded the program during 2004 to include Wassa. The goals of the ALSD program are to assist the communities in the vicinity of our mining operations to create alternative employment opportunities, promote growth of sustainable economic development and to reduce the community's dependence on mining. Given the importance of agriculture in the local economy, much of our efforts have been focused on agricultural opportunities. Palm Oil - Palm oil is a major cash crop for many farmers in Southern Ghana and based on the historical success of Ghana's palm oil industry, we believe palm oil farming has the potential to make a significant contribution to the local community's economic development. Palm oil production requires land. Historically the economic base of many of the communities surrounding our operations has been based on mine employment. As a result many of the residents have not acquired land and have thus been excluded from farming in general and the palm oil business specifically. In the past three years we have assisted and trained in excess of 300 local residents to establish palm oil plantations on approximately 1,050 acres of reclaimed waste rock dumps and other areas around our mines. In 2006 we plan to initiate a new four-year program to significantly expand on the success of our initial palm oil program. To this end we have procured about 2,400 acres of additional land holding and aim to increase this to 5,000 acres of additional land in 2006. The land will be used to expand the palm oil cooperative program providing employment and eventual land ownership to as many as 2,000 local residents. We are also negotiating with a business partner in the palm oil business who will assist by providing a processing facility and a market for the oil. These plantations should fully mature in about three years with an expected yield of about 4,200 metric tonnes of fresh fruit bunch annually. Fish Farm - We have established a fish farm in one of the completed pits at Bogoso. The fish have done well and we now estimate there are approximately 10 tonnes of fish ready for harvesting. We hope that the success of this project will encourage development of private fish farms in the local communities. Sericulture - We have established a mulberry plantation and silk worm rearing facility at Bogoso. Thirty local farmers are now participating in this project and have to date produced 45 kilograms of silk cocoons. 39 Poultry - Our demonstration farm is also training and assisting local farmers with poultry production. A ban on importation of poultry products from several countries due to bird flu concerns has created this opportunity for local farmers. The program has implemented 12 poultry projects with 2,650 chicks in ten communities. The poultry project will focus on egg production. Other Projects - Other projects we are supporting or plan to support in 2006 include snail farming, mushrooms, citrus production and vocational training. In collaboration with government agencies, the Ghana Department of Cooperatives is assisting us in developing the project beneficiary groups into commodity based associations including the Oil Palm Farmers Association, Poultry Farmers Association and Sericulture Farmers Association and four Ministry of Agriculture staff are providing technical support to the beneficiary farmers in the areas surrounding our operations. Other contacts have been made with local and international non-governmental organizations in developing micro-credit schemes on behalf of the company. Community Assistance Programs - In addition to the alternative livelihood projects described above, we are involved in the ongoing funding of several community assistance projects. Over the past few years we have provided funding and assistance for school improvements and equipment, libraries, day care centers, community centers, potable water systems and wells, sports facilities, toilet facilities, electrification projects, health facilities, road improvements and hospital equipment. At our corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado the employees and their family members initiated a book donation program in late 2005 seeking to obtain 150,000 books which will be used to stock libraries in the communities around our operations. To date approximately 25,000 volumes have been donated, sorted and packed for shipment. Local high school student volunteers have done most of the sorting and packing. The books acquired to date include a wide assortment of topics including primary and secondary school texts, children's books, novels, reference, travel and general interest books. Endowment Fund - In late 2005, we established two endowment funds in Ghana, one at Wassa and one at Bogoso. The purposes of the endowment funds are to promote and facilitate sustainable socio-economic development and to improve the quality of life in the communities surrounding our operations and in 2006 we will transition to channeling all of our community assistance programs through these funds. The funds will provide funding for development projects and charitable causes. The fund will receive periodic cash contributions from BGL and WGL based on gold production and net income. OPERATING PROPERTIES The Bogoso/Prestea Gold Mine Overview of the Bogoso/Prestea Operation Bogoso/Prestea consists of a gold mining and processing operation located along the Ashanti Trend in western Ghana, approximately 35 kilometers northwest of the town of Tarkwa. It can be reached by paved roads from Tarkwa and from Accra, the capital of Ghana. Bogoso and Prestea are adjoining mining concessions that together cover approximately 40 kilometers of strike of the southwest trending Ashanti gold district. The mining areas at Prestea are linked to the Bogoso processing plant by approximately 12 kilometers of paved and gravel haul-roads located on our properties. Equipment and facilities at Bogoso/Prestea include several open pit mines, a nominal 6,000 tonne per day CIL gold processing plant and a fleet of haul trucks, loaders and mining support equipment. In addition, there are numerous ancillary support facilities such as power and water supply equipment, haul roads, housing for management and technical staff, a medical clinic, tailings storage facility, waste dumps, warehouse, maintenance shops, offices and administrative facilities. The Bogoso/Prestea properties and mining rights are granted under four mining leases, which expire on or after August 2017. Commercial mining at Bogoso dates back to the early years of the 20th century. During its 20-year period of operations from 1935 to 1955, production totaled over 900,000 ounces of gold at an average recovered grade of 3.73 g/t. From 1873 to 1965, the current Prestea property was comprised of a number of different licenses operated by independent mining companies, which in 1965 were amalgamated by the Government of Ghana into Prestea Goldfields Limited, under the aegis of the State Gold Mining Corporation. Total gold production from the Prestea area since recorded mining commenced in the 1870s is reported by the Ghana Mineral Commission to be in excess of nine million ounces, making it the second largest historical gold producing area in Ghana, after the Obuasi mine. 40 We acquired Bogoso in late 1999 and all of our production came from reserves located on the Bogoso concession until October 2001 when we commenced surface mining on the adjoining Prestea concession. The Prestea concession was acquired in mid-2001. From 1999 through 2005 we have produced 811,800 ounces of gold from Bogoso/Prestea. Operating Results for Bogoso/Prestea The following table displays historical operating results at Bogoso/Prestea. Bogoso/Prestea Operating Results 2005 2004 2003 - -------------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- Ore milled (t) 1,557,881 1,650,412 2,093,600 Rate (t/day) 4,268 4,526 5,736 Grade milled (g/t) 4.14 4.09 3.29 Recovery % 60.7 67.3 81.2 Total gold production (oz)(1) 131,898 147,875 174,315 Cash operating cost ($/oz) 338 250 166 Total cash cost ($/oz) 351 264 184 (1) Gold production is shown on a 100% basis, which represents our current beneficial interest in gold production and revenues. Once all capital has been repaid, the Government of Ghana would receive 10% of the dividends from the subsidiaries owning the Bogoso/Prestea and Wassa mines. Bogoso/Prestea Expansion Project Gold ore reserves in general and specifically at Bogoso/Prestea can be segregated into two general ore types referred to as "refractory" and "non-refractory." Refractory ores typically contain un-oxidized sulfide minerals with the gold trapped within the sulfide minerals. Such ores are also commonly referred to as "sulfide" ores and they cannot be economically processed in conventional CIL circuits such as our existing Bogoso processing plant. Non-refractory ores typically contain no sulfides or the sulfide minerals have been naturally oxidized. There are also certain sulfide ores that are non-refractory if the gold exists on surface of the sulfide minerals rather than embedded within the sulfide minerals. Ores that have been naturally oxidized are referred to as "oxide" ores. Non-refractory ores, including oxide ores, can be efficiently processed through the existing Bogoso CIL processing plant. Since 75% of the remaining ore reserves at Bogoso/Prestea are refractory and cannot be processed by our existing plant, a decision was made in June 2005 to construct a new 3.5 million tonne per annum processing facility at Bogoso, located next to the existing non-refractory processing plant, which will utilize a proprietary BIOX(R) bio-oxidation technology to treat the refractory sulfide ore. When completed in late 2006, the new sulfide plant together with the existing CIL plant, are expected to be able to process a combined 5.0 million tonnes per year of ore. Completion on schedule and anticipated production levels for the new facility are subject to a number of risks, including the issuance in a timely manner of all necessary development and operating permits. The existing CIL processing plant will retain its current configuration and will continue to process non-refractory ores during the construction phase of the new BIOX(R) plant. After the new BIOX(R) plant comes on line, it is anticipated that the existing Bogoso CIL processing plant will process mostly oxide ores and the BIOX(R) plant will process mostly refractory sulfide ores and mixed oxide-refractory ores. The two plants sitting side-by-side are expected to provide operational efficiencies since they will share management, labor, reagents, warehouse parts and maintenance efforts. And with the two plants and their differing technologies, we should be able to effectively process all of the ore types known to exist in the Bogoso/Prestea area. Construction work on the BIOX(R) plant is proceeding within schedule and budget. Ordering of long lead-time items is substantially complete as is the detailed engineering design. Concrete work is well progressed for all of the equipment. The stainless steel BIOX(R) reactor tanks have been erected and structural steel erection has commenced. Erection of the CIL tanks is also nearing completion which will allow structural steel erection to also commence in this area. The electrical contractor has mobilized and has commenced work. The crusher and new SAG mill were shipped to Ghana in March and the ball mill is already on site and mounted on its pedestal. 41 The design and construction of the expansion project is being managed by GRD Minproc on an engineering, procurement and construction management basis. Work has proceeded under a letter of agreement entered into in February 2005 and a definitive contract is expected to be finalized shortly. Pre-stripping of two sulfide pits in readiness for the commissioning of the BIOX(R) plant has already commenced and will be accelerated when additional trucks are delivered, commencing in April 2006. The non-refractory plant will continue to process non-refractory ores from the Plant-North pit at Prestea until completion of mining in the fourth quarter of 2006. Afterward we plan to feed the non-refractory plant with oxide ores from Pampe, Mampon and various areas on the south end of the Prestea property. We estimate that the total capital cost of the new sulfide plant project, including the expansion of the mining fleet, to be approximately $125 million, and we expect a 15 to 18 month construction period, ending in late 2006. At the end of 2005, approximately $36 million of the total had been spent. In 2007, following the completion of the BIOX(R) plant, we expect the combined gold production from the two Bogoso plants to be approximately 370,000 ounces per annum at an average cash operating cost of $330 per ounce. Based on our test work, we expect gold recoveries from the BIOX(R) process to average 86% and vary between 78% and 88%. Geology at Bogoso/Prestea The Bogoso/Prestea property lies within the Eburnean Tectonic Province in the West African Precambrian Shield along a 40 kilometer stretch of the Ashanti Trend located immediately south of the town of Bogoso. The area is dominated by a major northeast-southwest trending structural fault zone referred to as the Ashanti Trend, which hosts the Prestea, Bogoso, Obuasi and Konongo gold deposits, among others. Parallel to the Ashanti Trend is the Akropong Trend, which hosts the Ayanfuri deposit. The Akropong Trend is about 15 kilometers west of the Ashanti Trend in the Bogoso region, and gradually converges with it, converging at Obuasi and forming the basis for the Obuasi deposit, owned and operated by AngloGold Ashanti Limited. Mineral Reserves and Non-Reserve Mineral Resources at Bogoso/Prestea Bogoso/Prestea has proven and probable Mineral Reserves, excluding the Mineral Reserves at Mampon discussed below, of 33.3 million tonnes at a grade of 2.69 g/t containing approximately 2.88 million ounces of gold (before any reduction for the Government of Ghana's 10% minority interest). Total measured and indicated Mineral Resources, excluding those Mineral Resources at Mampon and Pampe discussed below, total 20.7 million tonnes with a grade of 2.18 g/t before a reduction for the 10% minority interest. Assuming no new reserves are discovered, the current proven and probable Mineral Reserves should support mining operations for approximately seven years, although we expect the mine life to be extended as we continue to evaluate mineral resources through ongoing exploration efforts. See the Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves table and the Non-Reserves - Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource table in Item 1 of this Form 10-K. Exploration at Bogoso/Prestea Exploration activities on the Bogoso property in 2005 focused on defining and expanding the sulfide reserves in advance of initiation of a sulfide ore pre-strip program in early 2006. The drilling also focused on requirements to finalize pit designs at Chujah and Buesichem. These two pits are scheduled to provide sulfide feed to the new sulfide plant in 2006, 2007 and into 2008. In addition, drilling at other areas at Bogoso was conducted to understand and expand the sulfide reserves beneath several of the other old oxide pits. A total of $7.5 million was spent on exploration at Bogoso in 2005. Surface exploration drilling on the Prestea property during 2005 was limited to the evaluation of shallow underground targets in the Plant-North pit vicinity. While results in areas drilled during 2005 were not encouraging, other zones directly beneath the Plant-North pit will be tested in 2006. A Bogoso/Prestea regional geologic mapping program initiated in 2004 continued during 2005. The program will cover approximately 265 square kilometers around the Bogoso and Prestea properties when completed in early 2006. The Mampon Project The Mampon deposit, which is located within the Dunkwa properties, is approximately 35 kilometers north of the Bogoso processing plant. It was acquired in 2003, as part of the Dunkwa property acquisition. An analysis of the drilling and other geologic data provided by the former owner as well as our own drilling in 2004 and 2005 has established a probable reserve of approximately 1.6 million tonnes grading 4.53 grams per tonne or approximately 230,000 ounces of gold which is accessible by open pit mining methods. The geology of the 42 Mampon deposit is similar to the geology at Bogoso/Prestea. Our current plan is to haul the Mampon ore by truck to the Bogoso processing plant to supplement ores from the Bogoso/Prestea deposits. Our current long-term plan calls for mining Mampon in 2007 and 2008. Mampon ore is approximately 50% refractory and 50% non-refractory. The Pampe Project The Pampe deposit is located approximately 19 kilometers west of the Bogoso processing plant on the Akropong trend. While we have owned the rights to Pampe for several years, drilling during 2005 identified a measured and indicated resource of 0.2 million tonnes at an average grade of 4.4 g/t most of which is either oxide ore or non-refractory sulfide ore and most of which should be recoverable by open pit mining methods. Permitting for this project is now underway and haul road construction is scheduled for 2006. We expect to commence mining at Pampe before the end of 2006. Bondaye/Tuapim Area Due to the presence of illegal miners no work was carried out on the south end of the Prestea property during 2005. Once the illegal miner situation is resolved, we anticipate additional exploration work in these areas with the ultimate goal of mining oxide ores for the Bogoso oxide plant after 2007. We also expect to further investigate initially the shallow and ultimately the deeper underground potential of this area. The Wassa Gold Mine Overview of the Wassa Gold Mine The Wassa gold mine located approximately 35 kilometers east of Bogoso/Prestea, was initially developed in the late 1990s by a consortium of European mining companies and consisted of an open pit mine, a crusher and a conventional heap leach operation. While operating as a heap leach property, Wassa produced approximately 90,000 ounces of gold per annum for a period of just over two years beginning in 1999 and ending in mid-2001 when mining operations were suspended. In September 2002 WGL, our 90% owned subsidiary, acquired the inactive Wassa gold property located 35 kilometers east of Bogoso/Prestea. As with Bogoso/Prestea, the Government of Ghana holds a 10% carried interest which entitles it to 10% of any future dividends (none have been declared to date). Dividend payments will not be made until WGL has repaid all contributed capital and shareholder advances to Golden Star. In late 2003, following completion of a feasibility study we initiated construction of a nominal 3.5 million tonnes per year (10,000 tonne per day) CIL processing plant at Wassa. The construction phase ended in early 2005, and the Wassa open-pit mine and plant was placed in service on April 1, 2005. In the nine months ended December 31, 2005, Wassa processed 2.7 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 0.91 grams per tonne and shipped 69,070 ounces of gold at an average total cash cost per ounce of $482. Plant feed is a mixture of newly mined ore from the Wassa pit blended with material from the heap leach pads left by the prior owners. During 2006, we expect to produce approximately 120,000 ounces of gold at Wassa at an average cash operating cost of approximately $340 per ounce. We expect production to increase and unit costs to decline later in 2006 and beyond as we expose higher grade ores at deeper levels in the pit and also resolve certain plant design issues which have limited plant through-put to less than design capacity since its in-service date. In 2007, we expect annual gold production of approximately 130,000 ounces per year, at an average cash operating cost of around $340 per ounce. The reserves at Wassa at the end of 2005 should be sufficient to support operations to early 2011. Geology at Wassa Wassa lies within the Eburnean Tectonic Province in the West African Precambrian Shield. The Proterozoic rocks that comprise most of the West African craton and host the major gold mineralization in Ghana are subdivided into metasedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Birimian and Tarkwaian sequences. Wassa is hosted within the same Birimian volcano-sedimentary greenstone package as Bogoso/Prestea. Wassa is situated on the southeastern limb of the Tarkwa Syncline while Bogoso and Prestea occur along the northwestern limb. The northwestern belt hosts the Obuasi, Prestea, and Bogoso gold mines but the southeastern limb also is characterized by gold mines and mineral occurrences. Tarkwaian-hosted deposits along the southeastern limb include Goldfield's Tarkwa and Abosso mines, while Birimian-hosted gold occurrences include our Hwini-Butre concession and Wassa. 43 Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources at Wassa At December 31, 2005, Wassa has a probable mineral reserve of 21.9 million tonnes with an average grade of 1.34 g/t containing approximately 0.94 million ounces of gold before any reduction for the Government of Ghana's 10% minority interest. Total indicated mineral resources consist of 11.3 million tonnes with a grade of approximately 0.76 g/t before any reduction for the 10% minority interest. See the Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves table and the Non-Reserves - Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource table in Item 1 of this 10-K. Exploration at Wassa Exploration activities at Wassa during 2005 concentrated on RC drilling of two parallel geochemical anomalies identified in 2004 which extend southwest approximately 2 kilometers from the main pit area. Other than one narrow zone that typically carried 3 to 3.5 grams per tonne, results were not encouraging. Various other geochemical anomalies were also tested at Wassa by RAB drilling during 2005 and while most of these projects are at a very preliminary stage, results were encouraging with several intercepts at various places on the property exceeding minimum ore grades. Work continued on the South Akyempim zone discovered in 2004. We have now identified approximately 2.7 million tonnes of near-surface ore at an average grade of 1.47 grams per tonne in this area and we have initiated the process to acquire mining permits to allow mining of this deposit in the second half of 2006. EXPLORATION STAGE PROPERTIES IN GHANA Prestea Underground Overview The Prestea Underground is an inactive underground gold operation located directly beneath our Prestea property consisting of two operating shafts and extensive underground workings and support facilities. Support facilities include an administrative office, maintenance shops, a warehouse and electrical substations. Access to the mine site is via a paved road from Tarkwa and Accra maintained by the Government of Ghana. Any potential future production from the Prestea Underground would most likely be trucked to the Bogoso processing plant for processing. The Prestea Underground has produced approximately nine million ounces of gold, the second highest production of any mine in Ghana. The underground workings are extensive, reaching depths of approximately 1,400 meters and extending along a strike length of approximately ten kilometers. Underground workings can currently be accessed via two shafts, one near the town of Prestea and a second approximately four kilometers to the southwest. Underground operations ceased in early 2002, following an extended period of low gold prices. In March 2002, our subsidiary BGL entered into a joint venture agreement with the former owners to further explore and evaluate the remaining potential of the underground operations. In late 2003, our partner in the Prestea Underground joint venture filed for bankruptcy in Ghana. Our partner's position, under the provisions of the joint venture agreement has now reverted to a 2.5% net profits interest, which is currently controlled by the former partner's bankruptcy trustee. Since there is currently no production from the Prestea Underground mine there is no net profit to share with our bankrupt partner. BGL now holds a 90% ownership in the Prestea Underground. The Government of Ghana continues to hold a 10% ownership in Prestea Underground as well as its 10% holding in BGL, resulting in an 81% beneficial ownership by Golden Star. Geology of Prestea Underground The Prestea deposits are found along the Ashanti Trend which extends over 220 kilometers and which accounts for 80% to 90% of the total quartz lode-hosted gold extracted in Ghana. Other mines located along the same shear are our Bogoso pits and the Obuasi and Konongo mines owned by others. Two types of gold hosts have historically been recognized at Prestea: fault-related hydrothermal quartz veins; and disseminated sulfide-hosted gold mineralization associated with metavolcanic pods. The first type of ore was the focus of intense mining during Prestea's past production. We intend to evaluate both types of mineralization. 44 Mineral Resources at Prestea Underground As of December 31, 2005 we have identified total non-reserve inferred mineral resources at the Prestea Underground of 6.1 million tonnes at an average grade of 8.1 g/t before any reduction for the 19% minority interest. Exploration Activities at Prestea Underground A total of 8,096 meters of underground exploration drilling was completed at the Prestea Underground during 2005. The drilling focused on testing extensions of the high grade West Reef shoot between levels 17-24 (a depth of between 700 and 900 meters) and also prospective zones of remnant mineralization lying below and to the south of the Plant-North pit which could be exploited via a decline at the base of the pit. Results from both these areas have been encouraging with drilling to continue in 2006. A deep surface hole at Bondaye was initiated during 2004 to test the down plunge extension of high grade mineralization to approximately 250 meters below the extent of current historical workings. Although technical problems and delays were seen in 2004, the drilling was completed mid 2005 for a total of 2,109 meters including a parent hole to 1,604 meters and a "wedged" daughter hole to 1,504 meters. Only spotty, discontinuous gold mineralization was encountered in the reef zone at both the parent and daughter hole. However this may simply reflect the typical "pinch and swell" character of the Prestea reef system and cannot be considered a definitive test of the Bondaye plunge potential. Total spending on long term assets at Prestea Underground totaled $12.1 million in 2005, up from $7.1 million during 2004. Spending in 2005 included $2.6 million on underground drilling and other geological activities, $5.8 million on feasibility work, $2.3 million on dewatering, security and site maintenance, and $1.4 million on equipment purchases. Support crews continue to maintain the underground and surface facilities in good working order and assist the underground drilling teams. By the end of 2005, dewatering efforts had cleared the lowest sections of the old underground workings and an extensive underground drilling program has been initiated which will continue during most of 2006 to test areas immediately below the deepest old workings. We believe these deeper levels provide the best opportunities for significant new discoveries in the Prestea Underground. We intend to complete an initial feasibility study by the end of 2006 evaluating the economic potential of restarting production from the Prestea Underground mine. St. Jude Properties The St. Jude Properties were acquired in late December 2005 as part of the St. Jude acquisition. These properties consist of the Hwini-Butre and Benso gold concessions (prospecting licenses) at the southeastern end of the Ashanti gold belt region in Ghana. While we now hold a 100% interest in these properties (through our subsidiaries), the Government of Ghana will become entitled to a 10% carried interest at the time mining permits are granted. The Hwini-Butre concession is located approximately 80 kilometers south of Wassa and occupies an area of approximately 180 square kilometers. St. Jude and its predecessors have previously carried out numerous exploration programs on the concessions and identified two significant zones of gold mineralization. The St. Jude Properties also include the Benso concession, located in the Tarkwa District, directly north of the Hwini-Butre concession and about 40 kilometers south of Wassa. The Benso concession covers an area of approximately 21 square kilometers, and consists of three blocks: the Amantin, Subriso, and Chichiwelli blocks. St. Jude and its predecessors previously conducted a geochemical soil sampling survey over the Benso concession and drill programs on the three blocks. We commenced our own exploration activities on the St. Jude Properties in early 2006, and have budgeted approximately $4.6 million for the program in 2006. The Hwini-Butre and Benso concessions lie along the southeastern flank of the Birimian-aged (lower Proterozoic) Ashanti Belt, along the same structural trend as Wassa. The southwestern part of the Hwini-Butre concession covers the Mpohor Complex, a syn-volcanic mafic intrusive that is bound to the east and north by the Butre volcanic sequence. The Mpohor Complex is a polyphase intrusion with compositions ranging from gabbroic to granophyric, with intermediate phases such as diorite and granodiorite. The Butre volcanic sequence, which also underlies the Benso concession further north, mostly comprises volcanic flows with minor metasediment horizons. The main regional structural orientation trends northeasterly but extensive north to northwest trending cross-cutting fracture systems are also well developed. The latter host much of the mineralization in 45 the district, with vein systems at Dabokrom, Father Brown, Adoikrom, the Subriso zones and Amantin located within or marginal to the Mpohor Complex. Mineralization on the Hwini-Butre concession is typically associated with shallowly east-dipping narrow quartz veins and their associated sericitic alteration halos, with coarse free gold associated with sulfides and as specks within the quartz veins and altered host rocks. In contrast, mineralization at Subriso West and Central Subriso forms a series of relatively steep dipping, north-trending zones characterized by strong shearing and pervasive silica replacement with local silica flooding and only minor thin quartz veining. Studies will be carried out during 2006 to determine if ore from the St. Jude Properties should be hauled to the Wassa plant for processing or if a stand-alone processing plant should be built in the general vicinity of the St. Jude Properties. Akropong Trend Properties During 2005, we continued working on the Akropong Trend properties located approximately 10 to 20 kilometers to the west of Bogoso/Prestea. The objective of this work was to identify additional mineral reserve opportunities in the immediate vicinity of Bogoso/Prestea that could, in the future, provide additional sources of processing plant feed for the Bogoso processing plants. As explained above, drilling at the Pampe property established a measured and indicated resource at Pampe during 2005. The other Akropong Trend projects are still at an early stage of exploration and to date they do not have, and ultimately might not have, proven and probable mineral reserves. We spent approximately $1.4 million on Akropong projects during 2005 compared to $0.4 million in 2004. Most of the Akropong spending was related to RAB and RC drilling at the Pampe property. Dunkwa Properties (including Mampon) Overview of the Dunkwa Properties In 2003, we purchased two prospecting licenses, Asikuma and Mansiso, along the Ashanti Trend from Birim Goldfields Inc., which we refer to as the Dunkwa properties. These properties cover 45 kilometers of strike along the Ashanti Trend directly north of and contiguous with the current Bogoso concession. They are accessible by Ghanaian public roads. The addition of the Asikuma and Mansiso prospecting licenses, which cover 56 and 69 square kilometers, respectively, increases our property holdings along the trend to over 100 kilometers in length. In 2003, we also acquired from Ashanti Goldfields Company Limited the rights to the Mampon prospect located on the Asikuma license. Ore from Mampon is expected to be trucked to the Bogoso processing plant commencing in 2007. The Mampon prospect was discovered in 1988 using regional geochemical methods and consists of narrow quartz veins with strong pyrite and arsenopyrite mineralization in the wall rocks ranging up to 15% total sulfides. These prospects are also associated with shearing and/or graphitic faults, similar to those seen at Bogoso. There are five known gold prospects on the Dunkwa concession. All of these occur in the same approximate stratigraphic position within lower Birimian sediments from 1 to 1.5 kilometers west of the contact with the Birimian metavolcanics. Exploration Activities at the Dunkwa Properties Most of the work on the Dunkwa properties during 2005 was focused on the Mampon area where data was gathered to assist in pit design for surface mining now scheduled for late 2007. Late in 2005 we began a drilling program on an unexplored nine kilometer section of the property covered by Opon river valley sediments which coincides with a conductivity anomaly. Spending in the Dunkwa area totaled $1.4 million in 2005. Regional Activities in Ghana In 2005, we continued with several early stage regional projects in southern Ghana by conducting geochemical surveys over extensive areas to the east and south of the Bogoso/Prestea and Wassa areas extending east to within 30 kilometers of Accra (see map at the beginning of Item
