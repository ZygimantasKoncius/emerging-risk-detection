ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information included in, or incorporated by reference into in this Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks that we are not presently aware of, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also become important factors that affect us. All of these risks and uncertainties could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.17Table of ContentsWe face substantial capital requirements and financial risks.Our business requires a substantial investment of capital. The production, acquisition and distribution of motion pictures and television programs require a significant amount of capital. A significant amount of time may elapse between our expenditure of funds and the receipt of revenues from our motion pictures or television programs. This time lapse may require us to fund a significant portion of our capital requirements from our credit facilities or other financing sources. Although we intend to continue to reduce the risks of our production exposure through financial contributions from broadcasters and distributors, tax credit programs, government and industry programs, other studios and co-financiers and other sources, we cannot assure you that we will continue to successfully implement these arrangements or that we will not be subject to substantial financial risks relating to the production, acquisition, completion and release of future motion pictures and television programs. In addition, if we increase (through internal growth or acquisition) our production slate or our production budgets, we may be required to increase overhead and/or make larger up-front payments to talent and, consequently, bear greater financial risks. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.The costs of producing and marketing feature films is high and may increase in the future, which may make it more difficult for a film to generate a profit or compete against other films. The costs of producing and marketing feature films generally increase from year to year, which may make it more difficult for our films to generate a profit or compete against other films. A continuation of this trend would leave us more dependent on other media, such as home entertainment, television, international markets and digital, which revenues may not be sufficient to offset an increase in the cost of motion picture production and marketing. If we cannot successfully exploit these other media, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.Budget overruns may adversely affect our business. While our business model requires that we be efficient in the production of our motion pictures and television programs, actual motion picture and television production costs may exceed their budgets. The production, completion and distribution of motion pictures and television productions can be subject to a number of uncertainties, including delays and increased expenditures due to disruptions or events beyond our control. As a result, if a motion picture or television production incurs substantial budget overruns, we may have to seek additional financing from outside sources to complete production or fund the overrun ourselves. We cannot make assurances regarding the availability of such financing or on terms acceptable to us, nor can we assure you that we will recoup these costs. Increased costs incurred with respect to a particular film may result in any such film not being ready for release at the intended time and the postponement to a potentially less favorable date, all of which could cause a decline in box office performance, and, thus, the overall financial success of such film. Budget overruns could also prevent a picture from being completed or released. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior secured notes. In the absence of such cash flows or capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior secured notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from such dispositions. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result:•our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;•the lenders under our credit facilities could terminate their commitments to lend us money;•the holders of our secured debt could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings; and/or•we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.18Table of ContentsIf our level of corporate debt increases, it could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, require us to dedicate substantial capital to servicing our debt obligations, expose us to interest rate risk, limit our ability to pursue strategic business opportunities, affect our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations.As of March 31, 2015, our corporate debt was $718.0 million (carrying value - $714.1 million). In addition, our productionloan obligations were $600.9 million. On July 19, 2013, we redeemed $432.0 million of our 10.25% Senior Secured Second-Priority Notes (the “10.25% Senior Notes”), issued $225.0 million of our 5.25% Senior Secured Second-Priority Notes (the “5.25% Senior Notes”) and borrowed $225.0 million under our Second Lien Credit and Guarantee Agreement dated July 19, 2013 (the “Term Loan Due 2020”). On March 17, 2015, we redeemed the Term Loan Due 2020 and borrowed $375 million under our Second Lien Credit and Guarantee Agreement dated March 17, 2015 (the "Term Loan Due 2022"). On March 17, 2015, the April 2009 3.625% Notes were called for redemption and in April 2015, the holders of the notes converted substantially all of the outstanding principal amounts into common shares. On May 4, 2015, we amended the Term Loan Due 2022 to increase the aggregate principal amount to $400 million.A substantial degree of leverage could have important consequences, including the following:•it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, motion picture and television development, production and distribution, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes, or limit our ability to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us;•a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including funding motion picture and television production, development and distribution and other operating expenses, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;•the debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;•certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest, exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates;•it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;•it may limit our ability to pursue strategic acquisitions and other business opportunities that may be in our best interests;•we may be vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business; and/or•we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.Despite our current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional debt in the future.Although each of our credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior secured notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including guarantees, make restricted payments and investments, and grant liens on our assets, the covenants contained in such debt documents provide a number of important exceptions and thus, do not prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so. Such exceptions will provide us substantial flexibility to incur indebtedness, grant liens and expend funds to operate our business. For example, under the terms of the indenture governing our senior secured notes (i) with few restrictions, we may incur indebtedness in connection with certain film and television financing arrangements, including without limitation, purchasing or acquiring rights in film or television productions or financing print and advertising expenses, and such indebtedness may be secured by liens senior to the liens in respect of our senior secured notes, and (ii) in limited circumstances, we may make investments in assets that are not included in the borrowing base supporting our senior secured notes, in each case, without having to meet the leverage ratio tests for debt incurrence or to fit such investments within the restricted payments “build up basket” or within other categories of funds applicable to making investments and other restricted payments under the indenture governing our senior secured notes.In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness through our senior secured credit facility. We may borrow up to $800 million under the senior secured credit facility. At March 31, 2015, we have no borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, and no letters of credit outstanding. We could borrow some or all of the remaining permitted amount in the future. The amount we have available to borrow under this facility depends upon our borrowing base, which in turn depends on the value of our existing library of films and television programs, as well as accounts receivable and cash held in collateral accounts. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries' existing debt levels, this has the potential to magnify the risks discussed above relating to our ability to service our indebtedness and the potential adverse impact our high level of indebtedness could have on us.19Table of ContentsAn increase in the ownership of our common shares by certain shareholders could trigger a change in control under the agreements governing our long-term indebtedness.The agreements governing certain of our long-term indebtedness contain change in control provisions that are triggered when any of our shareholders, directly or indirectly, acquires ownership or control in excess of a certain percentage of our common shares. As of May 11, 2015, three of our shareholders, Mark H. Rachesky, M.D., Capital World Investors, and Capital Research Global Investors, and their respective affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 27.3%, 5.7% and 5.4%, respectively, of our outstanding common shares.Under certain circumstances, including the acquisition of ownership or control by a person or group in excess of 50% of our common shares, the holders of our senior secured notes and our convertible senior subordinated notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such notes upon a change in control and the holders of our convertible senior subordinated notes may be entitled to receive a make whole premium based on the price of our common shares on the change in control date. We may not be able to repurchase these notes upon a change in control because we may not have sufficient funds. Further, we may be contractually restricted under the terms of our secured credit facilities from repurchasing all of the notes tendered by holders upon a change in control. Our failure to repurchase our senior secured notes upon a change in control would cause a default under the indentures governing the senior secured notes and the convertible senior subordinated notes and a cross-default under our secured credit facilities.Our secured credit facilities also provide that a change in control, which includes a person or group acquiring ownership or control in excess of 50% of our outstanding common shares, will be an event of default that permits lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder and to enforce security interests in the collateral securing such debt, thereby limiting our ability to raise cash to purchase our outstanding senior secured notes and convertible senior subordinated notes. Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar provisions.Restrictive covenants may adversely affect our operations.Our credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior secured notes contain various covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability to, among other things:•incur or assume additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;•issue redeemable stock and preferred stock;•pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;•prepay, redeem or repurchase debt that is junior in right of payment to our senior secured notes;•make loans, investments and capital expenditures;•incur liens;•engage in sale/leaseback transactions;•restrict dividends, loans or asset transfers from our subsidiaries;•sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;•consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person;•enter into transactions with affiliates; and•enter into new lines of business.These covenants may prevent us from raising additional financing, competing effectively or taking advantage of new business opportunities. In addition, the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests and the indenture governing our senior secured notes, outside of specified exceptions, requires us to satisfy certain financial tests in order to engage in activities such as incurring debt or making restricted payments. Our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control (such as a change in control event), and we cannot assure you that we will meet them. See “An increase in the ownership of our common shares by certain shareholders could trigger a change in control under the agreements governing our long-term indebtedness.” Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facilities, the indenture governing our senior secured notes or the agreements governing our other financing arrangements, the holders of such debt could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and the lenders under our credit facilities could terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Further, the holders of our secured debt that is secured by a first priority or other senior lien, could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which collateral represents substantially all of our assets. If the holders of our debt accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flow or assets to repay our debt, or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, or terms that are acceptable to us.20Table of ContentsVariable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Certain of our borrowings, primarily borrowings under our senior credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same. The applicable margin with respect to loans under our senior secured credit facility is a percentage per annum equal to 2.50% plus an adjusted rate based on LIBOR.Assuming that our senior secured credit facility is fully drawn, based on the applicable LIBOR in effect as of March 31, 2015, each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a $2.0 million change in annual interest expense. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps, involving the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments, to reduce interest rate volatility.We have had losses in the past, and we cannot assure future profitability.Even though we have reported operating income for fiscal years 2010 through 2015, we had an operating loss for fiscal year 2009. We have also reported net losses for the fiscal years 2009 through 2012. Our retained earnings were $13.7 million at March 31, 2015. We cannot assure you that we will operate profitably in future periods and, if we do not, we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements, working capital requirements, capital expenditure plans, production slate, acquisition and releasing plans or other cash needs. Our inability to meet those needs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.We may incur significant write-offs if our feature films and other projects do not perform well enough to recoup production, marketing and distribution costs.We are required to amortize capitalized production costs over the expected revenue streams as we recognize revenue from the associated films or other projects. The amount of production costs that will be amortized each quarter depends on, among other things, how much future revenue we expect to receive from each project. Unamortized production costs are evaluated for impairment each reporting period on a project-by-project basis. If estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized production costs, the unamortized production costs will be written down to fair value. In any given quarter, if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue from any individual feature film or other project, we may be required to accelerate amortization or record impairment charges with respect to the unamortized costs, even if we have previously recorded impairment charges for such film or other project. Such impairment charges could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.Our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly.Our results of operations are difficult to predict and depend on a variety of factors. Our results of operations depend significantly upon the commercial success of the motion pictures and television programming that we distribute, which cannot be predicted with certainty. In particular, the underperformance at the box office of one or more motion pictures in any period may cause our revenue and earnings results for that period (and potentially, subsequent periods) to be less than anticipated, in some instances to a significant extent. Accordingly, our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and the results of any one period may not be indicative of the results for any future periods.Our results of operations also fluctuate due to the timing, mix, number and availability of our theatrical motion picture and home entertainment releases, as well as license periods for our content. Our operating results may increase or decrease during a particular period or fiscal year due to differences in the number and/or mix of films released compared to the corresponding period in the prior year or prior fiscal year.Moreover, our results of operations may be impacted by the success of all of our theatrical releases, including critically acclaimed and award winning films. We cannot assure you that we will manage the production, acquisition and distribution of all future motion pictures successfully including critically acclaimed, award winning and/or commercially popular films or that we will produce or acquire motion pictures that will receive critical acclaim or perform well commercially. Any inability to achieve such commercial success could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.Our operating results also fluctuate due to our accounting practices (which are standard for the industry) which may cause us to recognize the production and marketing expenses in different periods than the recognition of related revenues, which may occur 21Table of Contentsin later periods. For example, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and industry practice, we are required to expense film advertising costs as incurred, but are also required to recognize the revenue from any motion picture or television program over the entire revenue stream expected to be generated by the individual picture or television program. In addition, we amortize film and television programming costs using the "individual-film-forecast" method. Under this accounting method, we amortize film and television programming costs for each film or television program based on the following ratio:Revenue earned by title in the current periodEstimated total future revenues by title as of the beginning of the yearWe regularly review, and revise when necessary, our total revenue estimates on a title-by-title basis. This review may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write-down of the film or television asset to its estimated fair value. Results of operations in future years depend upon our amortization of our film and television costs. Periodic adjustments in amortization rates may significantly affect these results.In addition, the comparability of our results may be affected by changes in accounting guidance or changes in our ownership of certain assets and businesses. For example, in fiscal 2011, we retrospectively deconsolidated our interest in Pop (formerly TV Guide Network) due to new accounting guidance and now account for our holding in that business under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our results of operations from year to year may not be directly comparable to prior reporting periods.As a result of the foregoing and other factors, our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and the results of any one period may not be indicative of the results for any future period.We have few output agreements with cable and broadcast channels. We distribute our library of motion picture titles and television episodes and programs through EPIX, certain broadcast channels such as Pop (which exhibit our films, but license such rights on a film-by-film, rather than an output basis) and, specifically, for certain Summit Entertainment motion picture titles, through Showtime Networks and HBO. We cannot assure you that we will be able to secure other output agreements on acceptable terms, if at all. Without multiple output agreements that typically contain guaranteed minimum payments, our revenues may be subject to greater volatility, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.We do not have long-term arrangements with many of our production or co-financing partners. We typically do not enter into long term production contracts with the creative producers of the films we produce, acquire or distribute. Moreover, we generally have certain derivative rights that provide us with distribution rights to, for example, prequels, sequels and remakes of certain films we produce, acquire or distribute. However, there is no guarantee that we will produce, acquire or distribute future films by any creative producer or co-financing partner, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.We rely on a few major retailers and distributors and the loss of any of those retailers or distributors could reduce our revenues and operating results. Wal-Mart represented approximately 8% of our revenues in fiscal 2015. In addition, a small number of other retailers and distributors account for a material percentage of our revenues. We do not have long-term agreements with retailers. We cannot assure you that we will continue to maintain favorable relationships with our retailers and distributors or that they will not be adversely affected by economic conditions. If any of these retailers or distributors reduces or cancels a significant order or becomes bankrupt, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.Our revenues and results of operations are vulnerable to currency fluctuations. We report our revenues and results of operations in U.S. dollars, but a significant portion of our revenues is earned outside of the U.S. Our currency exposure is between Canadian dollars, British pound sterling, Euros, Australian dollars and U.S. dollars. We cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and operating margins, and fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects. From time to time, we may experience currency exposure on distribution and production revenues and expenses from foreign countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.Failure to manage future growth may adversely affect our business.We are subject to risks associated with possible acquisitions, business combinations, or joint ventures. From time to time, we engage in discussions and activities with respect to possible acquisitions, sale of assets, business combinations, or joint ventures intended to complement or expand our business, some of which may be significant transactions for us. We may not realize the anticipated benefit from any of the transactions we pursue. Regardless of whether we consummate any such transaction, the 22Table of Contentsnegotiation of a potential transaction (including associated litigation and proxy contests), as well as the integration of the acquired business, could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of management's time and resources. Any such transaction could also result in impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, development write-offs and other related expenses. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.We may be unable to integrate any business that we acquire or have acquired or with which we combine or have combined. Integrating any business that we acquire or have acquired or with which we combine or have combined may be distracting to our management and disruptive to our business and may result in significant costs to us. We could face several challenges in the consolidation and integration of information technology, accounting systems, personnel and operations. If any such integration is unsuccessful, or if the integration takes longer than anticipated, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects. We may have difficulty managing the combined entity in the short term if we experience a significant loss of management personnel during the transition period after the significant acquisition.Claims against us relating to any acquisition or business combination may necessitate our seeking claims against the seller for which the seller may not indemnify us or that may exceed the seller's indemnification obligations. There may be liabilities assumed in any acquisition or business combination that we did not discover or that we underestimated in the course of performing our due diligence. Although a seller generally will have indemnification obligations to us under an acquisition or merger agreement, these obligations usually will be subject to financial limitations, such as general deductibles and maximum recovery amounts, as well as time limitations. We cannot assure you that our right to indemnification from any seller will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the amount of any undiscovered or underestimated liabilities that we may incur. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.We may not be able to obtain additional funding to meet our requirements. Our ability to grow through acquisitions, business combinations and joint ventures, to maintain and expand our development, production and distribution of motion pictures and television programs, and to fund our operating expenses depends upon our ability to obtain funds through equity financing, debt financing (including credit facilities) or the sale or syndication of some or all of our interests in certain projects or other assets or businesses. If we do not have access to such financing arrangements, and if other funds do not become available on terms acceptable to us, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.Our dispositions may not aid our future growth. If we determine to sell individual properties, libraries or other assets or businesses, we will benefit from the net proceeds realized from such sales. However, our revenues may suffer in the long term due to the disposition of a revenue generating asset, or the timing of such dispositions may be poor, causing us to fail to realize the full value of the disposed asset, all of which may diminish our ability to service our indebtedness and repay our notes and our other indebtedness at maturity. Furthermore, our goal of building a diversified platform for future growth may be inhibited if the disposed asset contributed in a significant way to the diversification of our business platform.Limitations on control of joint ventures may adversely impact our operations.We hold our interests in certain businesses as a joint venture or in partnership with non-affiliated third parties. As a result of such arrangements, we may be unable to control the operations, strategies and financial decisions of such joint venture or partnership entities which could, in turn, result in limitations on our ability to implement strategies that we may favor and may limit our ability to transfer our interests. Consequently, any losses experienced by these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment.A significant portion of our filmed and television content library revenues comes from a small number of titles.We depend on a limited number of titles in any given fiscal quarter for the majority of the revenues generated by our filmed and television content library. In addition, many of the titles in our library are not presently distributed and generate substantially no revenue. If we cannot acquire new product and the rights to popular titles through production, distribution agreements, acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or other strategic alliances, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.We are limited in our ability to exploit a portion of our filmed and television content library.Our rights to the titles in our filmed and television content library vary; in some cases, we have only the right to distribute titles in certain media and territories for a limited term. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew expiring rights on acceptable terms and that any failure to renew titles generating a significant portion of our revenue would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.23Table of ContentsOur success depends on external factors in the motion picture and television industry.Our success depends on the commercial success of motion pictures and television programs, which is unpredictable. Generally, the popularity of our motion pictures and television programs depends on many factors, including the critical acclaim they receive, the format of their initial release (for example, theatrical or direct-to-video), their actors and other key talent, their genre and their specific subject matter, audience reaction, the quality and acceptance of motion pictures or programs that our competitors release into the marketplace at or near the same time, critical reviews, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure activities, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, many of which we do not control and all of which may change. We cannot predict the future effects of these factors with certainty. In addition, because a motion picture's or television program's performance in ancillary markets, such as home video and pay and free television, is often directly related to its box office performance or television ratings, poor box office results or poor television ratings may negatively affect future revenue streams. Our success will depend on the experience and judgment of our management to select and develop new investment and production opportunities. We cannot make assurances that our motion pictures and television programs will obtain favorable reviews or ratings, that our motion pictures will perform well at the box office or in ancillary markets or that broadcasters will license the rights to broadcast any of our television programs in development or renew licenses to broadcast programs in our library. The failure to achieve any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.Global economic turmoil and regional economic conditions in the U.S. could adversely affect our business. Global economic turmoil may cause a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, levels of intervention from the U.S. federal government and other foreign governments, decreased consumer confidence, overall slower economic activity and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets. A decrease in economic activity in the U.S. or in other regions of the world in which we do business could adversely affect demand for our films, thus reducing our revenues and earnings. A decline in economic conditions could reduce performance of our theatrical, television and home entertainment releases. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. Moreover, financial institution failures may cause us to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult to finance any future acquisitions, or engage in other financing activities. We cannot predict the timing or the duration of any downturn in the economy and we are not immune to the effects of general worldwide economic conditions.Licensed distributors' failure to promote our programs may adversely affect our business. We generally do not control the timing and manner in which our licensed distributors distribute our motion pictures or television programs; their decisions regarding the timing of release and promotional support are important in determining success. Any decision by those distributors not to distribute or promote one of our motion pictures, television programs or related products or to promote our competitors' motion pictures, television programs or related products to a greater extent than they promote ours could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.We could be adversely affected by strikes or other union job actions. We are directly or indirectly dependent upon highly specialized union members who are essential to the production of motion pictures and television programs. A strike by, or a lockout of, one or more of the unions that provide personnel essential to the production of motion pictures or television programs could delay or halt our ongoing production activities, or could cause a delay or interruption in our release of new motion pictures and television programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.We face substantial competition in all aspects of our business.We are smaller and less diversified than many of our competitors. Unlike us, an independent distributor and producer, most of the major U.S. studios are part of large diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations, including television networks and cable channels that can provide both the means of distributing their products and stable sources of earnings that may allow them to better offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their motion picture and television operations. In addition, the major studios have more resources with which to compete for ideas, storylines and scripts created by third parties as well as for actors, directors and other personnel required for production. The resources of the major studios may also give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets, including film libraries, that we might also be interested in acquiring.The motion picture industry is highly competitive and at times may create an oversupply of motion pictures in the market. The number of motion pictures released by our competitors, particularly the major studios, may create an oversupply of product in the market, reduce our share of box office receipts and make it more difficult for our films to succeed commercially. The limited supply of motion picture screens compounds this product oversupply problem. Oversupply may become most pronounced during peak release times, such as school holidays and national holidays, when theater attendance is expected to be highest. As a result 24Table of Contentsof changes in the theatrical exhibition industry, including reorganizations and consolidations, and major studio releases occupying more screens, the number of screens available to us when we want to release a picture may decrease. If the number of motion picture screens decreases, box office receipts, and the correlating future revenue streams, such as from home entertainment and pay and free television, of our motion pictures may also decrease. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that we can release all of our films when they are otherwise scheduled due to production or other delays, or a change in the schedule of a major studio. Any such change could adversely impact a film's financial performance. In addition, if we cannot change our schedule after such a change by a major studio because we are too close to the release date, the major studio's release and its typically larger promotion budget may adversely impact the financial performance of our film.We must successfully respond to rapid technological changes and alternative forms of delivery or storage to remain competitive.The entertainment industry in general continues to undergo significant developments as advances in technologies and new methods of product delivery and storage, or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these developments emerge. Consumers are spending an increasing amount of time on the internet and on mobile devices, and are increasingly viewing content on a time-delayed or on-demand basis from the internet, on their televisions and on handheld or portable devices. We and our distributors must adapt our businesses to changing consumer behavior and preferences and exploit new distribution channels. If we cannot successfully exploit these and other emerging technologies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.We face risks from doing business internationally.We distribute motion picture and television productions outside the U.S., in the United Kingdom and Ireland through Lionsgate UK, and through various output agreements and third party licensees elsewhere, and derive revenues from these sources. As a result, our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business, many of which are beyond our control. These risks include:•laws and policies affecting trade, investment and taxes, including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of funds and withholding taxes, and changes in these laws;•the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws regulating interactions and dealings with foreign government officials;•changes in local regulatory requirements, including restrictions on content; differing cultural tastes and attitudes;•differing degrees of protection for intellectual property;•financial instability and increased market concentration of buyers in foreign television markets, including in European pay television markets;•the instability of foreign economies and governments;•fluctuating foreign exchange rates;•the spread of communicable diseases in such jurisdictions, which may impact business in such jurisdictions; and•war and acts of terrorism.Events or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues from non-U.S. sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.Protecting and defending against intellectual property claims may have a material adverse effect on our business.Our ability to compete depends, in part, upon successful protection of our intellectual property. We attempt to protect proprietary and intellectual property rights to our productions through available copyright and trademark laws and licensing and distribution arrangements with reputable international companies in specific territories and media for limited durations. Despite these precautions, existing copyright and trademark laws afford only limited practical protection in certain countries where we distribute our products. As a result, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy and distribute our productions or certain portions or applications of our intended productions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.Litigation may also be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation, infringement or invalidity claims could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects. We cannot assure you that infringement or invalidity claims will not materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.25Table of ContentsOur more successful and popular film or television products or franchises may experience higher levels of infringing activity, particularly around key release dates. Alleged infringers have claimed and may claim that their products are permitted under fair use or similar doctrines, that they are entitled to compensatory or punitive damages because our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights are illegal or improper, and that our key trademarks or other significant intellectual property are invalid. Such claims, even if meritless, may result in adverse publicity or costly litigation. We vigorously defend our copyrights and trademarks from infringing products and activity, which can result in litigation. We may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings in the course of litigation, and there can be no assurance that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all cases. Regardless of the validity or the success of the assertion of any such claims, we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in enforcing our intellectual property rights or in defending against such claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.Others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us.One of the risks of the film and television production business is the possibility that others may claim that our productions and production techniques misappropriate or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties with respect to their previously developed films and televisions series, stories, characters, other entertainment or intellectual property. Irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims, we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending against them, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.Our business involves risks of liability claims for media content, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.As a distributor of media content, we may face potential liability for:•defamation;•invasion of privacy;•negligence;•copyright or trademark infringement (as discussed above); and•other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed.These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against producers and distributors of media content. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.Piracy of motion pictures may reduce the gross receipts from the exploitation of our films.Motion picture piracy is extensive in many parts of the world, including South America, Asia, and certain Eastern European countries, and is made easier by technological advances and the conversion of motion pictures into digital formats. This trend facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies of motion pictures in theatrical release on DVDs, Blu-ray discs, from pay-per-view through set-top boxes and other devices and through unlicensed broadcasts on free television and the internet. The proliferation of unauthorized copies of these products has had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on our business, because these products reduce the revenue we receive from our products. Additionally, in order to contain this problem, we may have to implement elaborate and costly security and anti-piracy measures, which could result in significant expenses and losses of revenue. We cannot assure you that even the highest levels of security and anti-piracy measures will prevent piracy.In particular, unauthorized copying and piracy are prevalent in countries outside of the U.S., Canada and Western Europe, whose legal systems may make it difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights. While the U.S. government has publicly considered implementing trade sanctions against specific countries that, in its opinion, do not make appropriate efforts to prevent copyright infringements of U.S. produced motion pictures, there can be no assurance that any such sanctions will be enacted or, if enacted, will be effective. In addition, if enacted, such sanctions could impact the amount of revenue that we realize from the international exploitation of motion pictures. If no embargoes or sanctions are enacted, or if other measures are not taken, we may lose revenue as a result of motion picture piracy.We face cybersecurity and similar risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, disruption of our businesses, damage to our brands and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses.Our online, mobile and app offerings, as well as our internal systems, involve the storage and transmission of our proprietary and personal information, and we and our partners rely on various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution 26Table of Contentsof programming. Although we monitor our security measures regularly, they may be breached due to employee error, computer malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to our data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in a loss of our proprietary information, a disruption of our distribution business or a reduction of the revenues we are able to generate from such distribution, damage to our brands and reputation, and significant legal and financial exposure, including from regulatory or consumer actions related to consumer data collection and other data privacy concerns, each of which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.Our success depends on certain key employees.Our success depends to a significant extent on the performance of a number of senior management personnel and other key employees, including production and creative personnel. We do not currently have significant “key person” life insurance policies for any of our employees. We have entered into employment agreements with our top executive officers and production executives. However, although it is standard in the motion picture industry to rely on employment agreements as a method of retaining the services of key employees, these agreements cannot assure us of the continued services of such employees. In addition, competition for the limited number of business, production and creative personnel necessary to create and distribute our entertainment content is intense and may grow in the future. Our inability to retain or successfully replace, where necessary, members of our senior management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.To be successful, we need to attract and retain qualified personnel.Our success continues to depend to a significant extent on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train and retain qualified professional, creative, technical and managerial personnel. Competition for the caliber of talent required to produce and distribute our motion pictures and television programs continues to increase. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in identifying, attracting, hiring, training and retaining such personnel in the future. If we were unable to hire, assimilate and retain qualified personnel in the future, such inability would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.While we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting, we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our securities.Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the accompanying rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC to implement it, require us to include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K an annual report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. During this process, if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that cannot be remediated in a timely manner, we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective. While we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective, the effectiveness of our internal controls in future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, and, as a result, the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the applicable policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective (or if our independent auditors disagree with our conclusion), we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have an adverse effect on our securities.Changes in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations, and changes in geographic operating results, may adversely affect our effective tax rates.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. We also conduct business and financing activities between our entities in various jurisdictions and we are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the countries in which we operate. Although uniform transfer pricing standards are emerging in many of the countries in which we operate, there is still a relatively high degree of uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws, by changes in the amount of revenue or earnings that we derive from international sources in countries with high or low statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations.27Table of ContentsIn addition, we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by federal, state, and foreign tax jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from possible examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. In making such assessments, we exercise judgment in estimating our provision for income taxes. While we believe our estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that final determinations from any examinations will not be materially different from those reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Any adverse outcome from any examinations may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results, which could cause the market price of our securities to decline.As of March 31, 2014, we concluded that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets were realizable and that a significant portion of the related valuation allowance previously established was no longer needed. This conclusion was based upon our expectation of sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize these assets. Based on our current assessment, we continue to believe that substantially all of our deferred tax assets will be realized. There is no assurance that we will attain our future expected levels of taxable income or that a valuation allowance against new or existing deferred tax assets will not be necessary in the future.We incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other expenses associated with corporate governance and public company reporting requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). These rules and regulations, which require significant legal and financial compliance costs, may make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage than was previously available. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our Board of Directors or as our executive officers.Certain shareholders own a majority of our outstanding common shares.As of May 11, 2015, five of our shareholders beneficially owned an aggregate of 70,362,773 of our common shares, or approximately 47.6% of the outstanding shares. In addition, one of these shareholders, Mark H. Rachesky, M.D., the beneficial owner of approximately 27.3% of our outstanding common shares, currently serves as the Chairman of our Board of Directors. Accordingly, these five shareholders, collectively, have the power to exercise substantial influence over us and on matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors, the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may make it more difficult for other shareholders to effect substantial changes in our company and may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or expediting, as the case may be, a change in control of our company.Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common shares, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have an adverse effect on the price of our common shares, and therefore our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations.As of May 11, 2015, approximately 38.5% of our common shares were held beneficially by certain individuals and institutional investors who each had ownership of equal to or greater than 5% of our common shares. We also filed a resale registration statement to enable certain shareholders who received our common shares in connection with our acquisition of Summit Entertainment in January 2012 and certain holders of debt convertible into our common shares, to resell our common shares. Sales by such individuals and institutional investors of a substantial number of shares of our common shares into the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have an adverse effect on the price of our common shares, which could materially impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of common shares or debt that is convertible into our common shares.Our online activities are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to privacy and child protection, which, if violated, could subject us to an increased risk of litigation and regulatory actions.In addition to our company websites and applications, we use third-party applications, websites, and social media platforms to promote our projects and engage consumers, as well as monitor and collect certain information about users of our online forums. A variety of laws and regulations have been adopted in recent years aimed at protecting children using the internet such as the Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”). COPPA sets forth, among other things, a number of restrictions on what website operators can present to children under the age of 13 and what information can be collected from them. There are also a variety of laws and regulations governing individual privacy and the protection and use of information collected from such individuals, particularly in relation to an individual's personally identifiable information (e.g., credit card numbers). Many foreign countries have adopted similar laws governing individual privacy, including safeguards which relate to the interaction with children. If our online activities were to violate any applicable current or future laws and regulations, we could be subject to litigation and regulatory actions, including fines and other penalties.28Table of ContentsAny decisions to reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders or repurchase our common shares pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program could cause the market price for our common shares to decline.Our payment of quarterly cash dividends and repurchases of our common shares pursuant to our share purchase program will be subject to, among other things, our financial position and results of operations, available cash and cash flow, capital requirements, and other factors. Any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of our common shares pursuant to our share repurchase program could cause the market price of our common shares to decline. Moreover, in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of our common shares are reduced or discontinued, our failure or inability to resume paying cash dividends or repurchasing our common shares at historical levels could result in a lower market valuation of our common shares.ITEM 1B.
