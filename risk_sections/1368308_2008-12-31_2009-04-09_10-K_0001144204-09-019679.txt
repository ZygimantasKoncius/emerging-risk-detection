The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. ii PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS With respect to this discussion, the terms, “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Hong Kong Highpower Technology, Inc., and our 100%-owned subsidiary Hong Kong Highpower Technology Company Limited (“HKHT”) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Shenzhen Highpower Technology Co., Ltd. (“Shenzhen Highpower”), HZ Highpower Technology Co., Ltd. (“HZ Highpower”) and Springpower Technology (Shenzhen) Company Limited (formerly named Sure Power Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd.) (“Springpower”). Corporate Information We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on January 3, 2006. We were originally organized as a “blank check” shell company to investigate and acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. On November 2, 2007, we closed a share exchange transaction, pursuant to which we (i) became the 100% parent of HKHT and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Shenzhen Highpower, (ii) assumed the operations of HKHT and its subsidiary and (iii) changed our name from SRKP 11, Inc. to Hong Kong Highpower Technology, Inc. HKHT was incorporated in Hong Kong in 2003, under the Companies Ordinance of Hong Kong. Shenzhen Highpower was founded in 2001. HKHT formed HZ Highpower and Springpower in 2008. HZ Highpower has not yet commenced business operations. In addition, on November 2, 2007, concurrently with the close of the share exchange transaction, we conducted a private placement transaction (the “Private Placement”). Pursuant to subscription agreements entered into with the investors, we sold an aggregate of 2,836,364 shares of Common stock at $1.10 per share. As a result, we received gross proceeds in the amount of $3.12 million. Through Shenzhen Highpower, we manufacture Nickel Metal Hydride (“Ni-MH”) rechargeable batteries for both consumer and industrial applications. We have developed significant expertise in Ni-MH battery technology and large-scale manufacturing that enables us to improve the quality of our battery products, reduce costs, and keep pace with evolving industry standards. In 2008, we commenced manufacturing Lithium-ion (“Li-ion”) rechargeable batteries through Springpower. Our automated machinery allows us to process key aspects of the manufacturing process to ensure high uniformity and precision, while leaving the non-key aspects of the manufacturing process to manual labor. Industry General Rapid advancements in electronic technology have expanded the number of battery-powered devices in recent years. As these devices have come to feature more sophisticated functions, more compact sizes and lighter weights, the sources of power that operate these products have been required to deliver increasingly higher levels of energy. This has stimulated consumer demand for higher-energy batteries capable of delivering longer service between recharges or battery replacement. In contrast to non-rechargeable batteries, after a rechargeable battery is discharged, it can be recharged and reused many times. Rechargeable batteries generally can be used in many non- rechargeable battery applications, as well as high energy drain applications such as electric toys, power tools, portable computers and other electronics, medical devices, and many other consumer products. High energy density and long achievable cycle life are important characteristics of rechargeable battery technologies. Energy density refers to the total electrical energy per unit volume stored in a battery. High energy density batteries generally are longer lasting power sources providing longer operating time and necessitating fewer battery recharges. Greater energy density will permit the use of batteries of a given weight or volume for a longer time period. Long cycle life is a preferred feature of a rechargeable battery because it allows the user to charge and recharge many times before noticing a difference in performance. Long achievable cycle life, particularly in combination with high energy density, is desirable for applications requiring frequent battery recharges. The initial technology for rechargeable batteries was nickel cadmium (“Ni-Cad”). Ni-Cad batteries are offered in a variety of sizes and shapes but suffer from low energy density and low cycle life. In addition, disposal of Ni-Cad batteries poses environmental issues due to the high toxicity level of cadmium. To meet the demand for higher performing rechargeable batteries, nickel-metal hydride (“Ni-MH”) batteries were developed. Electrically, Ni-MH batteries are similar to the Ni-Cad counterparts but utilize a hydrogen-absorbing alloy instead of cadmium. High capacity Ni-MH batteries can replace Ni-Cad batteries in many devices because they operate on the same voltage and possess similar power and fast charge capabilities, while offering the advantage of greater energy density. In devices such as power tools, electric toys, personal portable electronic devices and electric vehicles, Ni-MH batteries optimize equipment performance. Ni-MH batteries have several advantages including: 1 · High capacity - Because of the use of hydrogen as a cathode material, Ni-MH batteries have up to a 40 percent longer service life than ordinary Ni-Cad batteries of equivalent size. · Long cycle life - Up to 1,000 charge/discharge cycles. · No memory effect - Ni-Cad batteries suffer from a memory effect - when charging, the user must ensure that they are totally flat first, otherwise they 'remember' how much charge they used to have and die much quicker. Ni-MH batteries have a negligible memory effect, making charging quicker and more convenient. · Performs at extreme temperatures - Capable of operation on discharge from -20°C to 50°C (-4°F to 122°F) and charge from 0°C to 45°C (32°F to 113ºF). · Environmentally friendly - Zero percent cadmium or other toxic chemicals such as mercury. · Cost efficiency - Rechargeable Ni-MH batteries are substantially less expensive than rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. The first rechargeable Li-ion batteries were commercialized in 1991. Rechargeable Li-ion batteries are produced as cylindrical lithium-ion or prismatic lithium-polymer batteries. The energy density of Li-ion is typically twice that of the standard nickel-cadmium. Li-ion batteries are low maintenance, with no memory effect and no scheduled cycling required to prolong battery life. In addition, the self-discharge is less than half compared to nickel-cadmium, making lithium-ion well suited for modern applications, such as power tools, electric bicycles, laptops, LED lights, portable medical devices, digital cameras, and MP3 players. Despite its overall advantages, Li-ion technology has limitations that include fragility, aging, capacity deterioration and higher manufacturing cost. Manufacturers are constantly working to improve Li-ion technology with new and enhanced chemical combinations. Li-ion batteries have several advantages including: · High capacity— up to 100% higher energy density compared to standard nickel-cadmium batteries. · Low self-discharge— self-discharge can be less than half that of nickel-based batteries. · Low maintenance — no periodic discharge is needed and there is no memory effect. Specialty cells can provide very high current to applications such as power tools. · Flexible form factor— prismatic lithium polymer batteries can be produced in a wide variety of form factors for different products and applications. Li-ion batteries also have several limitations: · Requires protection circuit to maintain voltage and current within safe limits. · Subject to aging when not in use — storage in a cool place at 40% charge reduces the aging effect. · Transportation restrictions — shipment of larger quantities may be subject to regulatory control. · Manufacturing cost is approximately 40% greater than nickel-cadmium. 2 China China’s market share of battery production is expected to increase. China has a number of benefits in battery manufacturing, which are expected to drive this growth: — Low Costs. China continues to have a significant low cost of labor as well as easy access to raw materials and land. — Proximity to electronics supply chain. Electronics manufacturing in general continues to shift to China, giving China-based manufacturers a further cost and cycle time advantage. — Proximity to end-markets. China has focused in recent years on building its research, development and engineering skill base in all aspects of higher end manufacturing, including batteries. Competitive Strengths We believe the following competitive strengths contribute to our success and differentiate us from our competitors: Experienced management team Our senior management team has extensive business and industry experience. Our principal stockholder and Chairman, Mr. Dang Yu Pan, has over 10 years of experience in China’s battery industry. Additionally, other members of our senior management team have significant experience with respect to other key aspects of our operations, including product design, manufacturing, and sales and marketing. Market position Since our inception, we have primarily focused on the research, development and manufacture of Ni-MH battery cells. We have developed significant expertise in Ni-MH battery technology and large-scale manufacturing that enables us to improve the quality of our products, reduce costs, and keep pace with evolving industry standards. Our Ni-MH rechargeable batteries have been developed to respond to a number of specific market requirements such as recyclability, high power, high energy density, long life, low cost and other important characteristics for consumer and OEM applications. They are suitable for almost all applications where high currents and deep discharges are required. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Springpower Technology (Shenzhen) Co, Ltd., is a company that specializes in the research, manufacturing and marketing Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries. Our Li-ion manufacturing operations started in 2008, and although we are making progress in our Lithium-ion operations, these operations remain a small part of our overall company. Well-established distribution channels We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers and a well-established network of distributors and resellers, allowing us to penetrate customer markets worldwide. Our relationship with many of our distributors extends from our inception in 2001. We also continue to screen and identify our strongest customers in each distribution channel and to focus our sales efforts towards the largest and fastest growing distributors and resellers. Proven product manufacturing capabilities We selectively use automation in our manufacturing process to ensure a high uniformity and precision in our products while maintaining our cost-competitiveness. We use automated machinery in key stages of the manufacturing process while using manual labor for other stages to take advantage of the availability of low-cost, skilled labor in China. We have received several accreditations, including The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001: 2000, ISO 14001, Conformity Europende (CE) and Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (UL), attesting to our quality management requirements, manufacturing safety, controls, procedures and environmental performance. 3 Customer service expertise We work closely with our major customers in order to ensure high levels of customer satisfaction. To provide superior service and foster customer trust and loyalty, we offer flexible delivery methods and product feedback opportunities to our customers. Our sales representatives and marketing personnel undergo extensive training, providing them with the skills necessary to answer product and service-related questions, proactively educate potential customers about our products, and promptly resolve customer inquiries. Our Strategy Our goal is to become a global leader in the development and manufacture of rechargeable battery products. We intend to achieve this goal by implementing the following strategies: Continue to pursue cost-effective opportunities Our operating model, coupled with our modern manufacturing processes, has resulted in economies of scale, a low cost structure, and an ability to respond rapidly to customer demands. We intend to achieve greater cost-effectiveness by expanding our production capacity, increasing our productivity and efficiency in the manufacturing process and seeking to reducing the per unit cost of production through the use of advanced technologies. Aggressively pursue distribution channels We intend to broaden the scope of our distribution arrangements to increase sales penetration in targeted markets. We intend to select additional distributors based on their access to markets and retail outlets that are candidates for our products. In addition, we intend to expand our international sales presence and diversify our revenue sources by taking efforts to increase the percentage of our net revenues attributable to sales to emerging new markets. Expand existing and new product offerings Since the commencement of our battery operations in 2001, we have expanded our product offerings to multiple product lines, which include in each product line batteries of varying sizes, capacities and voltages. We intend to expand our existing lines of Ni-MH batteries for use in other applications, such as hybrid-electric cars, and devote additional resources to the development of our new line of rechargeable Li-ion batteries for higher-end, high-performance applications, such as laptop batteries. Enhance marketing efforts to increase brand awareness We continue to devote our efforts towards brand development and utilize marketing concepts in an attempt to enhance the marketability of our products. Products Our Ni-MH rechargeable batteries are versatile solutions for many diverse applications due to their long life, environmentally friendly materials, high power and energy, low cost and safe applications. Developed to meet the requirement for increasingly higher levels of energy demanded by today’s electronic products, our Ni-MH rechargeable batteries can offer up to increased capacity and higher energy density over similarly sized standard Ni-Cad rechargeable batteries. As a result, users can expect a longer time between charges and longer running time. Our Ni-MH rechargeable batteries are available in both cylindrical and prismatic shapes. In 2008, we completed the construction and build-out of two production lines for the development and manufacturing of a range of Li-ion rechargeable batteries and products. We produce two major series of Li-ion batteries & Li-polymer batteries with hundreds of different models for each series. Currently, we produce approximately 400,000 Li-ion battery units per month. We produce an extensive line of batteries, falling into two main categories: · Consumer Batteries – Relative to ordinary Ni-Cad rechargeable batteries, as well as their non-rechargeable counterparts, our Ni-MH and Li-ion batteries offer higher power capacity allowing for longer working time and shortened charging time during equivalent working periods. We produce A, AA and AAA sized batteries in blister packing as well as chargers and battery packs. 4 · Industrial Batteries – These batteries are designed for electric bikes, power tools and electric toys. They are specifically designed for high-drain discharge applications, possessing low internal resistance, more power, and longer discharging time. We also recycle batteries and resell the recycled materials to some of our customers. We are currently testing this market and anticipate expanding our battery recycling operations in the future. Net sales for each of our product segments as a percentage of net sales is set forth below: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Consumer Batteries 80 % 80 % 77 % Industrial Batteries 19 % 19 % 21 % Materials 1 % 1 % 2 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Supply of Raw Materials The cost of the raw materials used in our rechargeable batteries is a key factor in the pricing of our products. We purchase materials in volume which allows us the ability to negotiate better pricing with our suppliers. Our purchasing department locates eligible suppliers of raw materials striving to use only those suppliers who have previously demonstrated quality control and reliability. Currently, we purchase our raw materials, consisting primarily of metal materials including nickel oxide, nickel foam, metal hydride alloy and other battery components, such as membranes, from suppliers located in China and Japan. For our Li-ion batteries, we purchase raw materials consisting primarily of LiCo02, graphite, electrolyte and tab. We believe that the raw materials and components used in manufacturing our rechargeable batteries are available from enough sources to be able to satisfy our manufacturing needs; however, some of our materials, such as nickel, are available from a limited number of suppliers. Our top three suppliers of nickel account for 56% of our nickel supply. Our top three suppliers of lithium account for approximately 45% of our lithium supply. Presently, our relationships with our current suppliers are generally good and we expect that our suppliers will be able to meet the anticipated demand for our products in the future. At times, the pricing and availability of raw materials can be volatile, attributable to numerous factors beyond the Company’s control, including general economic conditions, currency exchange rates, industry cycles, production levels or a supplier’s tight supply. To the extent that we experience cost increases we may seek to pass such cost increases on to our customers, but cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to do so successfully or that our business, results of operations and financial condition would not be adversely affected by increased volatility of the cost and availability of raw materials. Quality Control We consider quality control an important element of our business practices. We have stringent quality control systems that are implemented by more than 100 company-trained staff members to ensure quality control over each phase of the production process, from the purchase of raw materials through each step in the manufacturing process. Supported by advanced equipment, we utilize a scientific management system and precision inspection measurement, capable of supplying stable, high-quality rechargeable batteries. Our quality control department executes the following functions: · setting internal controls and regulations for semi-finished and finished products; · testing samples of raw materials from suppliers; · implementing sampling systems and sample files; 5 · maintaining quality of equipment and instruments; and · articulating the responsibilities of quality control staff. We monitor quality and reliability in accordance with the requirements of QSR, or Quality System Review, and ISO 9001 systems. We have received European Union’s CE attestation, UL authentication, ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 14001 certification. We have passed stringent quality reviews and thus obtained OEM qualifications from various domestic cellular phone brand names. With our strong technological capabilities and use of automated equipment for core aspects of the manufacturing process, we believe our product quality meets or even exceeds in certain key aspects international industry standards. Manufacturing The manufacture of rechargeable batteries requires coordinated use of machinery and raw materials at various stages of manufacturing. We have a large-scale production base that includes a 484,000 square feet factory, a dedicated design, sales and marketing team, and approximately 1,800 company-trained employees. We use automated machinery to process key aspects of the manufacturing process to ensure high uniformity and precision, while leaving the non-key aspects of the manufacturing process to manual labor. We intend to further improve our automated production lines and strive to continue investing in our manufacturing infrastructure to further increase our manufacturing capacity, helping us to control the per unit cost of our products. The primary raw materials used in production of rechargeable batteries include electrode materials, electrolytes, foils, cases and caps and separators. The electrodes are manufactured using active materials, conductive agents and binder which are mixed with liquid. These mixtures are then uniformly coated onto the thin metal foil, then after drying, the electrodes are cut down to the designated sizes. The positive electrode and negative electrode are then wound together with a separator and inserted into a can, and electrolyte is filled. The sealing completes the battery cell assembly. Some of these cells are then integrated into packages which are customized into a wide variety of configurations to interface with different electronic devices. In October 2008, we commenced construction of our new manufacturing facility in Huizhou, Guangdong Province. The new facility will eventually house all Ni-MH and Li-ion production for the Company. The new facility’s production capacity will be approximately three times that of our current production facility in Shenzhen. Major Customers During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately 57% and 56% of our net sales were generated from our five largest customers, respectively. The percentages of net sales disclosed for each of our major customers includes sales to groups of customers under common control or that could be deemed affiliates of such major customers. During the year ended December 31, 2008, one customer, Energizer Battery Manufacturing, Inc., who accounted for 23% of our net sales. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we had two major customers, Energizer Battery Manufacturing, Inc. and Uniross Batteries (HK) Ltd., who accounted for 24% and 17% of sales, respectively. Sales and Marketing We have a broad sales network of approximately 50 salespersons in China and have one branch office in Hong Kong. Our sales staff in each of our offices targets key customers by arranging in-person sales presentations and providing post-sales services. Our sales staff works closely with our customers so that we can better address their needs and improve the quality and features of our products. We offer different price incentives to encourage large-volume and long-term customers. Sales to our customers are based primarily on purchase orders we receive from time to time rather than firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers. Uncertain economic conditions and our general lack of long-term purchase commitments with our customers make it difficult for us to predict revenue accurately over the longer term. Even in those cases where customers are contractually obligated to purchase products from us, we may elect not to enforce our contractual rights immediately because of the long-term nature of our customer relationships and for other business reasons, and instead may negotiate accommodations with customers regarding particular situations. 6 We target sales of our rechargeable batteries and charging systems through original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), as well as distributors and resellers focused on our target markets. We have contractual arrangements with distributors who market our products on a commission basis in particular areas. Although OEM agreements typically contain volume-based pricing based on expected volumes, typically prices are rarely adjusted retroactively if contract volumes are not achieved. We attempt to adjust future prices accordingly, but our ability to adjust prices is generally based on market conditions which we cannot control. Net sales based on the location of our customers as a percentage of net sales is set forth below: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 China and Hong Kong 41.2 % 39.5 % 65.4 % Europe 37.3 34.6 16.4 North America 14.5 17.5 10.2 Asia 6.4 8.1 7.4 South America and Others 0.6 0.3 0.6 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % * Less than 1%. While the largest portion of our sales are made to customers in China and Hong Kong, our products are distributed worldwide, with approximately 41.2% of our products distributed to Hong Kong and China, 14.5% to the United States, 37.3% to Europe and 7.0% to other markets. We engage in marketing activities such as attending industry-specific conferences and exhibitions to promote our products and brand name. We also advertise in industry journals and magazines and through the Internet to market our products. We believe these activities help in promote our products and brand name among key industry participants. Research and Development To enhance our product quality, reduce cost, and keep pace with technological advances and evolving market trends, we have established an advanced research and development center. Our research and development center is not only focused on enhancing our Ni-MH-based technology by developing new products and improving the performance of our current products, but also seeks to develop alternative technologies such as the line of rechargeable Li-ion batteries we are currently developing for higher-end, high performance applications. Our research and development center is currently staffed with over 75 research and development technicians who overlook our techniques department, product development department, material analysis lab, and performance testing lab. These departments work together to research new material and techniques, test battery performance, inspect products and to test performance of machines used in the manufacturing process. For years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 we expended $340,929 and $248,782, respectively, in research and development. Competition We face competition from many other battery manufacturers, many of which have significantly greater name recognition and financial, technical, manufacturing, personnel and other resources than we have. We compete against other Ni-MH and Li-ion battery producers, as well as manufacturers of other rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries. The main types of rechargeable batteries currently on the market include: lead-acid; nickel-cadmium; nickel metal hydride; liquid lithium-ion and lithium-ion polymer. Competition is typically based on design, quality, reliability, and performance. The technology behind Ni-MH rechargeable batteries has consistently improved over time and we continue to enhance our products to meet the competitive threats from its competitors. Our primary competitors in the Ni-MH battery market or other similar competing rechargeable battery products include SANYO Electric Co., Ltd. Global, Matsushita Industrial Co., Ltd. (Panasonic), BYD Company Ltd., GPI International, Ltd., and GS Yuasa Corporation. 7 Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of patent and trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights and to maintain and enhance our competitiveness in the battery industry. We currently hold five patents in China and have three patent applications pending in China. We also have two registered trademarks in China, which include “HFR” and its Chinese equivalent. Shenzhen Highpower is party to a license agreement with Ovonic Battery Company, Inc. (“Ovonic”) under which Ovonic granted Shenzhen Highpower (1) a royalty-bearing, non-exclusive license to use certain patents owned by Ovonic to manufacture Ni-MH batteries for portable consumer applications (“Consumer Batteries”) in the PRC and (2) a royalty-bearing, non-exclusive worldwide license to use certain patents owned by Ovonic to use, sell and distribute Consumer Batteries. The renewal agreement will remain in effect until the licensed patents under the agreement expire. Pursuant to the renewed agreement, Shenzhen Highpower will pay a license fee of up to $1.0 million based on gross sales of Consumer Batteries. We also rely on unpatented technologies to protect the proprietary nature of our product and manufacturing processes. We require that our management team and key employees enter into confidentiality agreements that require the employees to assign the rights to any inventions developed by them during the course of their employment with us. The confidentiality agreements include noncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions that remain effective during the course of employment and for periods following termination of employment, which vary depending on position and location of the employee. PRC Government Regulations Environmental Regulations The major environmental regulations applicable to us include the PRC Environmental Protection Law, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution and its Implementation Rules, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution and its Implementation Rules, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Solid Waste Pollution, and the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution. We constructed our manufacturing facilities with the PRC’s environmental laws and requirements in mind. We currently outsource the disposal of solid waste to a third party-contractor. In late 2007, we renewed our environmental permit, which expired in September 2007, from the Shenzhen Environment Protection Bureau Longgang Bureau covering our manufacturing operations and providing for an annual output limit of Ni-MH rechargeable batteries. Our new permit, which expires on December 31, 2010, does not include one of our current premises at our manufacturing facility. Although we substantially exceeded the approved annual output limit of Ni-MH rechargeable batteries set forth in our old permit, we do not expect to exceed the approved annual output limit set forth in our new permit. If we fail to comply with the provisions of the renewed permit, we could be subject to fines, criminal charges or other sanctions by regulators, including the suspension or termination of our manufacturing operations. We have not been named as a defendant in any legal proceedings alleging violation of environmental laws. Other than the expiration of our environmental approval, we have no reasonable basis to believe that there is any threatened claim, action or legal proceedings against us that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations due to any non-compliance with environmental laws. Patent Protection in China The PRC’s intellectual property protection regime is consistent with those of other modern industrialized countries. The PRC has domestic laws for the protection of rights in copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. The PRC is also a signatory to most of the world’s major intellectual property conventions, including: — Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO Convention) (June 4, 1980); — Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (March 19, 1985); — Patent Cooperation Treaty (January 1, 1994); and — The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) (November 11, 2001). 8 Patents in the PRC are governed by the China Patent Law and its Implementing Regulations, each of which went into effect in 1985. Amended versions of the China Patent Law and its Implementing Regulations came into effect in 2001 and 2003, respectively. The PRC is signatory to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, in accordance with which any person who has duly filed an application for a patent in one signatory country shall enjoy, for the purposes of filing in the other countries, a right of priority during the period fixed in the convention (12 months for inventions and utility models, and 6 months for industrial designs). The Patent Law covers three kinds of patents, i.e., patents for inventions, utility models and designs respectively. The Chinese patent system adopts the principle of first to file. This means that, where more than one person files a patent application for the same invention, a patent can only be granted to the person who first filed the application. Consistent with international practice, the PRC only allows the patenting of inventions or utility models that possess the characteristics of novelty, inventiveness and practical applicability. For a design to be patentable, it should not be identical with or similar to any design which, before the date of filing, has been publicly disclosed in publications in the country or abroad or has been publicly used in the country, and should not be in conflict with any prior right of another. PRC law provides that anyone wishing to exploit the patent of another must conclude a written licensing contract with the patent holder and pay the patent holder a fee. One rather broad exception to this, however, is that, where a party possesses the means to exploit a patent but cannot obtain a license from the patent holder on reasonable terms and in reasonable period of time, the PRC State Intellectual Property Office, or SIPO, is authorized to grant a compulsory license. A compulsory license can also be granted where a national emergency or any extraordinary state of affairs occurs or where the public interest so requires. SIPO, however, has not granted any compulsory license up to now. The patent holder may appeal such decision within three months from receiving notification by filing a suit in a people’s court. PRC law defines patent infringement as the exploitation of a patent without the authorization of the patent holder. A patent holder who believes his patent is being infringed may file a civil suit or file a complaint with a PRC local Intellectual Property Administrative Authority, which may order the infringer to stop the infringing acts. Preliminary injunction may be issued by the People’s Court upon the patentee’s or the interested parties’ request before instituting any legal proceedings or during the proceedings. Evidence preservation and property preservation measures are also available both before and during the litigation. Damages in the case of patent infringement is calculated as either the loss suffered by the patent holder arising from the infringement or the benefit gained by the infringer from the infringement. If it is difficult to ascertain damages in this manner, damages may be reasonably determined in an amount ranging from one to more times of the license fee under a contractual license. The infringing party may be also fined by Administration of Patent Management in an amount of up to three times the unlawful income earned by such infringing party. If there is no unlawful income so earned, the infringing party may be fined in an amount of up to RMB500,000, or approximately $62,500. Tax Pursuant to the Provisional Regulation of China on Value Added Tax and their implementing rules, all entities and individuals that are engaged in the sale of goods, the provision of repairs and replacement services and the importation of goods in China are generally required to pay VAT at a rate of 17.0% of the gross sales proceeds received, less any deductible VAT already paid or borne by the taxpayer. Further, when exporting goods, the exporter is entitled to a portion of or all the refund of VAT that it has already paid or borne. Our imported raw materials that are used for manufacturing export products and are deposited in bonded warehouses are exempt from import VAT. Foreign Currency Exchange Under the PRC foreign currency exchange regulations applicable to us, the Renminbi is convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Conversion of Renminbi for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan, security investment and repatriation of investment, however, is still subject to the approval of the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE. Foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell and/or remit foreign currencies at those banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business after providing valid commercial documents and, in the case of capital account item transactions, obtaining approval from the SAFE. Capital investments by foreign-invested enterprises outside of China are also subject to limitations, which include approvals by the Ministry of Commerce, the SAFE and the State Reform and Development Commission. 9 Dividend Distributions Under applicable PRC regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a foreign-invested enterprise in China are required to set aside at least 10.0% of their after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until the accumulative amount of such reserves reach 50.0% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. The board of directors of a foreign-invested enterprise has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation. Employees At December 31, 2008, we had approximately 1,800 employees, all of which are employed full-time. There are no collective bargaining contracts covering any of our employees. We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory. ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS Any investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Potential investors should carefully consider the material risks described below and all of the information contained in this Form 10-K before deciding whether to purchase any of our securities. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by these risks if any of them actually occur. None of our securities are currently listed or quoted for trading on any national securities exchange or national quotation system. If and when our securities are traded, the trading price could decline due to any of these risks, and an investor may lose all or part of his investment. Some of these factors have affected our financial condition and operating results in the past or are currently affecting us. This report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced described below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS Our limited operating history may not serve as an adequate basis to evaluate our future prospects and results of operations. We have a limited operating history. We were established in GuangZhou, China in 2001 and commenced operations in Shenzhen in 2002. Our limited operating history may not provide a meaningful basis for an investor to evaluate our business, financial performance and prospects. We may not be able to: — maintain our leading position in the Ni-MH battery market; — retain existing customers or acquire new customers; — diversify our revenue sources by successfully developing and selling our products in the global battery market and other markets; — keep up with evolving industry standards and market developments; — respond to competitive market conditions; — maintain adequate control of our expenses; — manage our relationships with our suppliers; — attract, train, retain and motivate qualified personnel; or — protect our proprietary technologies. If we are unsuccessful in addressing any of these challenges, our business may be materially and adversely affected. Our business depends in large part on the growth in demand for portable electronic devices. Many of our battery products are used to power various portable electronic devices. Therefore, the demand for our batteries is substantially tied to the market demand for portable electronic devices. A growth in the demand for portable electronic devices will be essential to the expansion of our business. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity. Decreases in consumer spending that may result from the current global economic downturn may weaken demand for items that use our battery products. A decrease in the demand for portable electronic devices would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are unable to predict the duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and the global adverse economic conditions and the effect such events might have on our business. 10 Our success depends on the success of manufacturers of the end applications that use our battery products. Because our products are designed to be used in other products, our success depends on whether end application manufacturers will incorporate our batteries in their products. Although we strive to produce high quality battery products, there is no guarantee that end application manufacturers will accept our products. Our failure to gain acceptance of our products from these manufacturers could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, even if a manufacturer decides to use our batteries, the manufacturer may not be able to market and sell its products successfully. The manufacturer’s inability to market and sell its products successfully could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects because this manufacturer may not order new products from us. Therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future success would be materially and adversely affected. We are and will continue to be subject to rapidly declining average selling prices, which may harm our results of operations. Portable consumer electronic devices, such as cellular phones, DVD players, and laptop computers are subject to rapid declines in average selling prices due to rapidly evolving technologies, industry standards and consumer preferences. Therefore, electronic device manufacturers expect suppliers, such as our company, to cut their costs and lower the price of their products to lessen the negative impact on the electronic device manufacturer’s own profit margins. As a result, we have previously reduced the price of some of our battery products and expect to continue to face market-driven downward pricing pressures in the future. Our results of operations will suffer if we are unable to offset any declines in the average selling prices of our products by developing new or enhanced products with higher selling prices or gross profit margins, increasing our sales volumes or reducing our production costs. Our success is highly dependent on continually developing new and advanced products, technologies, and processes and failure to do so may cause us to lose our competitiveness in the battery industry and may cause our profits to decline. To remain competitive in the battery industry, it is important to continually develop new and advanced products, technologies, and processes. There is no assurance that competitors’ new products, technologies, and processes will not render our existing products obsolete or non-competitive. Alternately, changes in legislative, regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive. Our competitiveness in the battery market therefore relies upon our ability to enhance our current products, introduce new products, and develop and implement new technologies and processes. We predominately manufacture and market Ni-MH batteries, and to a lesser extent, Li-ion and Li-polymer batteries. If our competitors develop alternative products with more enhanced features than our products, our financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. The research and development of new products and technologies is costly and time consuming, and there are no assurances that our research and development of new products will either be successful or completed within anticipated timeframes, if at all. Our failure to technologically evolve and/or develop new or enhanced products may cause us to lose competitiveness in the battery market and may cause our profits to decline. In addition, in order to compete effectively in the battery industry, we must be able to launch new products to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to install and certify any equipment needed to produce new products in a timely manner, or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facility and resources to full production under any new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our manufacturing facility. In addition, new product introductions and applications are risky, and may suffer from a lack of market acceptance, delays in related product development and failure of new products to operate properly. Any failure by us successfully to launch new products, or a failure by our customers to accept such products, could adversely affect our results. We have historically depended on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues and this dependence is likely to continue. We have historically depended on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 57%, 56% and 37.4% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We anticipate that a limited number of customers will continue to contribute to a significant portion of our net sales in the future. Maintaining the relationships with these significant customers is vital to the expansion and success of our business, as the loss of a major customer could expose us to risk of substantial losses. Our sales and revenue could decline and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more of these significant customers stops or reduces its purchasing of our products, or if we fail to expand our customer base for our products. 11 Significant order cancellations, reductions or delays by our customers could materially adversely affect our business. Our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders, and we generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers, but instead work with our customers to develop nonbinding forecasts of future requirements. Based on these forecasts, we make commitments regarding the level of business that we will seek and accept, the timing of production schedules and the levels and utilization of personnel and other resources. A variety of conditions, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customer’s industry, may cause customers to cancel, reduce or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated. Generally, customers may cancel, reduce or delay purchase orders and commitments without penalty, except for payment for services rendered or products competed and, in certain circumstances, payment for materials purchased and charges associated with such cancellation, reduction or delay. Significant or numerous order cancellations, reductions or delays by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Substantial defaults by our customers on accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. A substantial portion of our working capital consists of accounts receivable from customers. If customers responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products and services, or to make payments in a timely manner, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could materially adversely affect the servicing of these accounts receivable, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults in excess of management’s expectations. A significant deterioration in our ability to collect on accounts receivable could also impact the cost or availability of financing available to us. Certain disruptions in supply of and changes in the competitive environment for raw materials integral to our products may adversely affect our profitability. We use a broad range of materials and supplies, including metals, chemicals and other electronic components in our products. A significant disruption in the supply of these materials could decrease production and shipping levels, materially increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect our profit margins. Shortages of materials or interruptions in transportation systems, labor strikes, work stoppages, war, acts of terrorism or other interruptions to or difficulties in the employment of labor or transportation in the markets in which we purchase materials, components and supplies for the production of our products, in each case may adversely affect our ability to maintain production of our products and sustain profitability. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet our production schedules for some of our key products and to ship such products to our customers in timely fashion, which would adversely affect our sales, margins and customer relations. Our industry is subject to supply shortages and any delay or inability to obtain product components may have a material adverse effect on our business. Our industry is subject to supply shortages, which could limit the amount of supply available of certain required battery components. Any delay or inability to obtain supplies may have a material adverse effect on our business. During prior periods, there have been shortages of components in the battery industry and the availability of raw materials has been limited by some of our suppliers. We cannot assure investors that any future shortages or allocations would not have such an effect on our business. A future shortage can be caused by and result from many situations and circumstances that are out of our control, and such shortage could limit the amount of supply available of certain required materials and increase prices affecting our profitability. Our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in costs of raw materials, such as nickel. Our principal raw material is nickel, which is available from a limited number of suppliers in China. The price of nickel has been volatile during 2007. The price of nickel rose 67% from January 2007 to May 2007, but dropped 45% from May 2007 to September 2007. The prices of nickel and other raw materials used to make our batteries increase and decrease due to factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, domestic and worldwide demand, labor costs or problems, competition, import duties, tariffs, energy costs, currency exchange rates and those other factors described under “Certain disruptions in supply of and changes in the competitive environment for raw materials integral to our products may adversely affect our profitability.” In an environment of increasing prices for nickel and other raw materials, competitive conditions may impact how much of the price increases we can pass on to our customers and to the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers, our financial results could be adversely affected. 12 Our operations would be materially adversely affected if third-party carriers were unable to transport our products on a timely basis. All of our products are shipped through third party carriers. If a strike or other event prevented or disrupted these carriers from transporting our products, other carriers may be unavailable or may not have the capacity to deliver our products to our customers. If adequate third party sources to ship our products were unavailable at any time, our business would be materially adversely affected. We may not be able to increase our manufacturing output in order to maintain our competitiveness in the battery industry. We believe that our ability to provide cost-effective products represents a significant competitive advantage over our competitors. In order to continue providing such cost-effective products, we must maximize the efficiency of our production processes and increase our manufacturing output to a level that will enable us to reduce the per-unit production cost of our products. Our ability to increase our manufacturing output is subject to certain significant limitations, including: · our ability raise capital to acquire additional raw materials and expand our manufacturing facilities; · delays and cost overruns, due to increases in raw material prices and problems with equipment vendors; · delays or denial of required approvals and certifications by relevant government authorities; · diversion of significant management attention and other resources; and · failure to execute our expansion plan effectively. If we are not able to increase our manufacturing output and reduce our per-unit production costs, we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in the battery industry. Moreover, even if we expand our manufacturing output, we may not be able to generate sufficient customer demand for our products to support our increased production output. The market for our products and services is very competitive and, if we cannot effectively compete, our business will be harmed. The market for our products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Many of our competitors are larger and have significantly greater assets, name recognition and financial, personnel and other resources than we have. As a result, our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to potential acquisitions and other market opportunities, new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase our market share against the emergence of these or other sources of competition. Failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position could materially adversely affect our business and prospects. Warranty claims, product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business inherently exposes us to potential warranty and product liability claims, in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage (or both). Such claims may arise despite our quality controls, proper testing and instruction for use of our products, either due to a defect during manufacturing or due to the individual’s improper use of the product. In addition, if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective, then we may be required to participate in a recall of them. 13 Existing PRC laws and regulations do not require us to maintain third party liability insurance to cover product liability claims. Although we have obtained products liability insurance, if a warranty or product liability claim is brought against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, or a recall of one of our products is required, such claim or recall may result in damage to our reputation, breach of contracts with our customers, decreased demand for our products, costly litigation, additional product recalls, loss of revenue, and the inability to commercialize some products. Manufacturing or use of our battery products may cause accidents, which could result in significant production interruption, delay or claims for substantial damages. Our batteries can pose certain safety risks, including the risk of fire. While we implement stringent safety procedures at all stages of battery production that minimize such risks, accidents may still occur. Any accident, regardless of where it occurs, may result in significant production interruption, delays or claims for substantial damages caused by personal injuries or property damages. We cannot guarantee the protection of our intellectual property rights and if infringement of our intellectual property rights occurs, including counterfeiting of our products, our reputation and business may be adversely affected. To protect the reputation of our products, we have sought to file or register our intellectual property, as appropriate, in the PRC where we have our primary business presence. As of December 31, 2008, we have registered two trademarks as used on our battery products, one in English and in the other in its Chinese equivalent. Our products are currently sold under these trademarks in the PRC, and we plan to expand our products to other international markets. There is no assurance that there will not be any infringement of our brand name or other registered trademarks or counterfeiting of our products in the future, in China or elsewhere. Should any such infringement and/or counterfeiting occur, our reputation and business may be adversely affected. We may also incur significant expenses and substantial amounts of time and effort to enforce our trademark rights in the future. Such diversion of our resources may adversely affect our existing business and future expansion plans. As of December 31, 2008, we held five Chinese patents and had three Chinese patent applications pending. Additionally, we have licensed patented technology from Ovonic Battery Company, Inc. related to the manufacture of Ni-MH batteries. We believe that obtaining patents and enforcing other proprietary protections for our technologies and products have been and will continue to be very important in enabling us to compete effectively. However, there can be no assurance that our pending patent applications will issue, or that we will be able to obtain any new patents, in China or elsewhere, or that our or our licensors’ patents and proprietary rights will not be challenged or circumvented, or that these patents will provide us with any meaningful competitive advantages. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products or will not design around any patents that have been or may be issued to us or our licensors. Failure to obtain patents in certain foreign countries may materially adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in those international markets. If a sufficiently broad patent were to be issued from a competing application in China or elsewhere, it could have a material adverse effect upon our intellectual property position in that particular market. In addition, our rights to use the licensed proprietary technologies of our licensors depends on the timely and complete payment for such rights pursuant to license agreements between the parties; failure to adhere to the terms of these agreements could result in the loss of such rights and could materially and adversely affect our business. If our products are alleged to or found to conflict with patents that have been or may be granted to competitors or others, our reputation and business may be adversely affected. Rapid technological developments in the battery industry and the competitive nature of the battery products market make the patent position of battery manufacturers subject to numerous uncertainties related to complex legal and factual issues. Consequently, although we either own or hold licenses to certain patents in the PRC, and are currently processing several additional patent applications in the PRC, it is possible that no patents will issue from any pending applications or that claims allowed in any existing or future patents issued or licensed to us will be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that any rights granted there under will not provide us adequate protection. As a result, we may be required to participate in interference or infringement proceedings to determine the priority of certain inventions or may be required to commence litigation to protect our rights, which could result in substantial costs. Further, other parties could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of our products for allegedly conflicting with patents held by them. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of effort by our management and technical personnel. If any such actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in any such action or that any license required under any such patent would be made available on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain needed patents, licenses or proprietary information held by others may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to become involved in such litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our time and resources. Also, with respect to licensed technology, there can be no assurance that the licensor of the technology will have the resources, financial or otherwise, or desire to defend against any challenges to the rights of such licensor to its patents. 14 We rely on trade secret protections through confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers and other parties; the breach of such agreements could adversely affect our business ands results of operations. We also rely on trade secrets, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, customers and other parties. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors. To the extent that consultants, key employees or other third parties apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our proposed projects, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such information that may not be resolved in our favor. We may be involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our proprietary rights. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of effort by our management and technical personnel. The failure to manage growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our employee efficiency, product quality, working capital levels, and results of operations. Any significant growth in the market for our products or our entry into new markets may require and expansion of our employee base for managerial, operational, financial, and other purposes. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 1,800 full time employees. During any growth, we may face problems related to our operational and financial systems and controls, including quality control and delivery and service capacities. We would also need to continue to expand, train and manage our employee base. Continued future growth will impose significant added responsibilities upon the members of management to identify, recruit, maintain, integrate, and motivate new employees. Aside from increased difficulties in the management of human resources, we may also encounter working capital issues, as we will need increased liquidity to finance the purchase of raw materials and supplies, development of new products, and the hiring of additional employees. For effective growth management, we will be required to continue improving our operations, management, and financial systems and control. Our failure to manage growth effectively may lead to operational and financial inefficiencies that will have a negative effect on our profitability. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to timely and effectively meet that demand and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers. We are dependent on certain key personnel and loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success is, to a certain extent, attributable to the management, sales and marketing, and operational and technical expertise of certain key personnel. Each of the named executive officers performs key functions in the operation of our business. The loss of a significant number of these employees could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are dependent on a technically trained workforce and an inability to retain or effectively recruit such employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We must attract, recruit and retain a sizeable workforce of technically competent employees to develop and manufacture our products and provide service support. Our ability to implement effectively our business strategy will depend upon, among other factors, the successful recruitment and retention of additional highly skilled and experienced engineering and other technical and marketing personnel. There is significant competition for technologically qualified personnel in our business and we may not be successful in recruiting or retaining sufficient qualified personnel consistent with our operational needs. 15 Our planned expansion into new and existing international markets poses additional risks and could fail, which could cost us valuable resources and affect our results of operations. We plan to expand sales of our products into new and existing international markets including developing and developed countries, such as Japan, Russia, India, and Brazil. These markets are untested for our products and we face risks in expanding the business overseas, which include differences in regulatory product testing requirements, intellectual property protection (including patents and trademarks), taxation policy, legal systems and rules, marketing costs, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in political and economic conditions. Our expansion into the Li-ion battery business is subject to substantial risks, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In September 2008, we completed the construction and build-out of two production lines for the development and manufacturing of a range of Li-ion rechargeable batteries and products. We have limited experience in the development and production of Li-ion batteries, and due to this inexperience, we may be unable to manufacture our Li-ion battery products in the time frame and amounts expected or be unable to successfully commercialize our Li-ion products. The lithium ion battery market is competitive and risky and we are unsure whether our Li-ion products will gain market acceptance. We are competing against numerous competitors with greater financial resources than us, and due to the difficulties of entry into these markets, we may be unsuccessful and not be able to complete in the Li-ion battery industry. Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption in recent months, including, among other things, extreme volatility in securities prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, ratings downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. Governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address extreme market conditions that have included severely restricted credit and declines in real estate values. In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers. While currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to utilize our current credit facilities and finance our operations, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies such that our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations, including the financing of the construction of our new manufacturing facility, might be impaired. Without sufficient liquidity, we may be forced to curtail our operations and our planned expansion of our new Li-ion battery line and construction of our new manufacturing facility. Adverse market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities and access the capital necessary to operate and grow our business. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Furthermore, although our total revenues continue to improve in the third quarter of 2008, the current tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers to obtain financing for purchases of our products and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and capital position could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets. Our quarterly results may fluctuate because of many factors and, as a result, investors should not rely on quarterly operating results as indicative of future results. Fluctuations in operating results or the failure of operating results to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors may negatively impact the value of our securities. Quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors that could affect revenues or expenses in any particular quarter. Fluctuations in quarterly operating results could cause the value of our securities to decline. Investors should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of results of operations as an indication of future performance. As a result of the factors listed below, it is possible that in future periods results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. This could cause the market price of our securities to decline. Factors that may affect our quarterly results include: 16 · vulnerability of our business to a general economic downturn in China; · fluctuation and unpredictability of costs related to the raw material used to manufacture our products; · seasonality of our business; · changes in the laws of the PRC that affect our operations; · competition from our competitors; and · our ability to obtain necessary government certifications and/or licenses to conduct our business. RISKS RELATED TO DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA Substantially all of our assets are located in the PRC and substantially all of our revenues are derived from our operations in China, and changes in the political and economic policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and accordingly on the results of our operations and financial condition. Our business operations may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in the PRC. The Chinese government exerts substantial influence and control over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities. Our ability to operate in China may be adversely affected by changes in Chinese laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, raw materials, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. Under the current government leadership, the government of the PRC has been pursuing economic reform policies that encourage private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. There is no assurance, however, that the government of the PRC will continue to pursue these policies, or that it will not significantly alter these policies from time to time without notice. Our operations are subject to PRC laws and regulations that are sometimes vague and uncertain. Any changes in such PRC laws and regulations, or the interpretations thereof, may have a material and adverse effect on our business. The PRC’s legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system prevalent in the United States, decided legal cases have little value as precedent in China. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the laws and regulations governing our business, or the enforcement and performance of our arrangements with customers in the event of the imposition of statutory liens, death, bankruptcy or criminal proceedings. The Chinese government has been developing a comprehensive system of commercial laws, and considerable progress has been made in introducing laws and regulations dealing with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade. However, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published cases and judicial interpretation and their lack of force as precedents, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve significant uncertainties. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. Our principal operating subsidiary, Shenzhen Highpower Technology Co., Ltd, (“Shenzhen Highpower”) is considered a foreign invested enterprise under PRC laws, and as a result is required to comply with PRC laws and regulations, including laws and regulations specifically governing the activities and conduct of foreign invested enterprises. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new PRC laws or regulations may have on our businesses. If the relevant authorities find us in violation of PRC laws or regulations, they would have broad discretion in dealing with such a violation, including, without limitation: · levying fines; · revoking our business license, other licenses or authorities; 17 · requiring that we restructure our ownership or operations; and · requiring that we discontinue any portion or all of our business. The scope of our business license in China is limited, and we may not expand or continue our business without government approval and renewal, respectively. Our principal operating subsidiary, Shenzhen Highpower, is a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, commonly known as a WFOE. A WFOE can only conduct business within its approved business scope, which ultimately appears on its business license. Our license permits us to design, manufacture, sell and market battery products throughout the PRC. Any amendment to the scope of our business requires further application and government approval. In order for us to expand our business beyond the scope of our license, it will be required to enter into a negotiation with the authorities for the approval to expand the scope of our business. We cannot assure investors that Shenzhen Highpower will be able to obtain the necessary government approval for any change or expansion of its business. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations related to our manufacturing operations. Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that require us to obtain environmental permits for our battery manufacturing operations. We have an environmental permit from the Shenzhen Environment Protection Bureau Longgang Bureau (the “Bureau”) covering our manufacturing operations that expires on December 31, 2010. Historically, under a previous permit which expired in September 2007, we substantially exceeded the approved annual output limit of Ni-MH rechargeable batteries set forth in the permit. Although we do not currently expect to exceed the approved annual output limits under the new permit, we cannot guarantee that this will be the case. Additionally, our current permit does not cover one of our existing premises at our manufacturing facility. If we fail to comply with the provisions of our permit, we could be subject to fines, criminal charges or other sanctions by regulators, including the suspension or termination of our manufacturing operations. We cannot assure you that at all times we will be in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or our environmental permits or that we will not be required to expend significant funds to comply with, or discharge liabilities arising under, environmental laws, regulations and permits. Recent PRC regulations relating to acquisitions of PRC companies by foreign entities may create regulatory uncertainties that could restrict or limit our ability to operate, including our ability to pay dividends. Our failure to obtain the prior approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, for any offering and the listing and trading of our common stock could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, reputation and trading price of our common stock. The PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or “SAFE,” issued a public notice in November 2005, known as Circular 75, concerning the use of offshore holding companies in mergers and acquisitions in China. The public notice provides that if an offshore company controlled by PRC residents intends to acquire a PRC company, such acquisition will be subject to registration with the relevant foreign exchange authorities. The public notice also suggests that registration with the relevant foreign exchange authorities is required for any sale or transfer by the PRC residents of shares in an offshore holding company that owns an onshore company. The PRC residents must each submit a registration form to the local SAFE branch with respect to their ownership interests in the offshore company, and must also file an amendment to such registration if the offshore company experiences material events, such as changes in the share capital, share transfer, mergers and acquisitions, spin-off transactions or use of assets in China to guarantee offshore obligations. If any PRC resident stockholder of an offshore holding company fails to make the required SAFE registration and amended registration, the onshore PRC subsidiaries of that offshore company may be prohibited from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore entity. Failure to comply with the SAFE registration and amendment requirements described above could result in liability under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. Most of our PRC resident stockholders, as defined in the SAFE notice, have not registered with the relevant branch of SAFE, as currently required, in connection with their equity interests in HKHT. Because of uncertainty in how the SAFE notice will be interpreted and enforced, we cannot be sure how it will affect our business operations or future plans. For example, Shenzhen Highpower’s ability to conduct foreign exchange activities, such as the remittance of dividends and foreign currency-denominated borrowings, may be subject to compliance with the SAFE notice by our PRC resident beneficial holders. Failure by our PRC resident beneficial holders could subject these PRC resident beneficial holders to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit Shenzhen Highpower’s ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects. 18 On August 8, 2006, the PRC Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”), joined by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, the State Administration of Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and SAFE, released a substantially amended version of the Provisions for Foreign Investors to Merge with or Acquire Domestic Enterprises (the “Revised M&A Regulations”), which took effect September 8, 2006. These new rules significantly revised China’s regulatory framework governing onshore-to-offshore restructurings and foreign acquisitions of domestic enterprises. These new rules signify greater PRC government attention to cross-border merger, acquisition and other investment activities, by confirming MOFCOM as a key regulator for issues related to mergers and acquisitions in China and requiring MOFCOM approval of a broad range of merger, acquisition and investment transactions. Further, the new rules establish reporting requirements for acquisition of control by foreigners of companies in key industries, and reinforce the ability of the Chinese government to monitor and prohibit foreign control transactions in key industries. Among other things, the revised M&A Regulations include new provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle, or SPV, formed for listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals must obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such SPV’s securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website procedures specifying documents and materials required to be submitted to it by SPVs seeking CSRC approval of their overseas listings. However, the application of this PRC regulation remains unclear with no consensus currently existing among the leading PRC law firms regarding the scope and applicability of the CSRC approval requirement. Highpower’s PRC counsel, Zhong Lun Law Firm has advised us that because we completed our onshore-to-offshore restructuring before September 8, 2006, the effective date of the new regulation, it is not necessary for us to submit the application to the CSRC for its approval, and the listing and trading of our common stock does not require CSRC approval. If the CSRC or another PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that CSRC approval was required, we may face regulatory actions or other sanctions from the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. These regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from an offering of securities into the PRC, or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our common stock. The CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies also may take actions requiring us, or making it advisable for us, to halt any offering before settlement and delivery of the securities offered. Consequently, if investors engage in market trading or other activities in anticipation of and prior to settlement and delivery, they do so at the risk that settlement and delivery may not occur. Also, if later the CSRC requires that we obtain its approval, we may be unable to obtain a waiver of the CSRC approval requirements, if and when procedures are established to obtain such a waiver. Any uncertainties and/or negative publicity regarding this CSRC approval requirement could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. Furthermore, published news reports in China recently indicated that the CSRC may have curtailed or suspended overseas listings for Chinese private companies. These news reports have created further uncertainty regarding the approach that the CSRC and other PRC regulators may take with respect to us. It is uncertain how our business operations or future strategy will be affected by the interpretations and implementation of Circular 75 and the Revised M&A Regulations. It is anticipated that application of the new rules will be subject to significant administrative interpretation, and we will need to closely monitor how MOFCOM and other ministries apply the rules to ensure that our domestic and offshore activities continue to comply with PRC law. Given the uncertainties regarding interpretation and application of the new rules, we may need to expend significant time and resources to maintain compliance. The foreign currency exchange rate between U.S. Dollars and Renminbi could adversely affect our financial condition. To the extent that we need to convert U.S. Dollars into Renminbi for our operational needs, our financial position and the price of our common stock may be adversely affected should the Renminbi appreciate against the U.S. Dollar at that time. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. Dollars for the operational needs or paying dividends on our common stock, the dollar equivalent of our earnings from our subsidiaries in China would be reduced should the dollar appreciate against the Renminbi. 19 Until 1994, the Renminbi experienced a gradual but significant devaluation against most major currencies, including dollars, and there was a significant devaluation of the Renminbi on January 1, 1994 in connection with the replacement of the dual exchange rate system with a unified managed floating rate foreign exchange system. Since 1994, the value of the Renminbi relative to the U.S. Dollar has remained stable and has appreciated slightly against the U.S. Dollar. Countries, including the United States, have argued that the Renminbi is artificially undervalued due to China’s current monetary policies and have pressured China to allow the Renminbi to float freely in world markets. In July 2005, the PRC government changed its policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the dollar. Under the new policy the Renminbi is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of designated foreign currencies. While the international reaction to the Renminbi revaluation has generally been positive, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in further and more significant appreciation of the Renminbi against the dollar. Because most of our sales are made in U.S. Dollars and most of our expenses are paid in RMB, devaluation of the U.S. Dollar could negatively impact our results of operations. The value of RMB is subject to changes in China’s governmental policies and to international economic and political developments. In January, 1994, the PRC government implemented a unitary managed floating rate system. Under this system, the People’s Bank of China, or PBOC, began publishing a daily base exchange rate with reference primarily to the supply and demand of RMB against the U.S. Dollar and other foreign currencies in the market during the previous day. Authorized banks and financial institutions are allowed to quote buy and sell rates for RMB within a specified band around the central bank’s daily exchange rate. On July 21, 2005, PBOC announced an adjustment of the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar to RMB from 1:8.27 to 1:8.11 and modified the system by which the exchange rates are determined. This modification has resulted in an approximate 7.3% appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. Dollar from July 21, 2005 to May 2, 2007. While the international reaction to the RMB revaluation has generally been positive, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in further fluctuations of the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against the RMB, including future devaluations. Because most of our net sales are made in U.S. Dollars and most of our expenses are paid in RMB, any future devaluation of the U.S. Dollar against the RMB could negatively impact our results of operations. Inflation in the PRC could negatively affect our profitability and growth. While the PRC economy has experienced rapid growth, such growth has been uneven among various sectors of the economy and in different geographical areas of the country. Rapid economic growth can lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. During the past decade, the rate of inflation in China has been as high as approximately 20% and China has experienced deflation as low as approximately minus 2%. If prices for our products and services rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for the rise in the costs of supplies such as raw materials, it may have an adverse effect on our profitability. In order to control inflation in the past, the PRC government has imposed controls on bank credits, limits on loans for fixed assets and restrictions on state bank lending. The implementation of such policies may impede economic growth. In October 2004, the People’s Bank of China, the PRC’s central bank, raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade and indicated in a statement that the measure was prompted by inflationary concerns in the Chinese economy. In April 2006, the People’s Bank of China raised the interest rate again. Repeated rises in interest rates by the central bank would likely slow economic activity in China which could, in turn, materially increase our costs and also reduce demand for our products and services. Failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. As our ultimate holding company is a Delaware corporation, we are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices may occur from time-to-time in the PRC. We can make no assurance, however, that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 20 If we make equity compensation grants to persons who are PRC citizens, they may be required to register with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the PRC, or SAFE. We may also face regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our ability to adopt an equity compensation plan for our directors and employees and other parties under PRC law. On April 6, 2007, SAFE issued the “Operating Procedures for Administration of Domestic Individuals Participating in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan or Stock Option Plan of An Overseas Listed Company, also know as “Circular 78.” It is not clear whether Circular 78 covers all forms of equity compensation plans or only those which provide for the granting of stock options. For any plans which are so covered and are adopted by a non-PRC listed company after April 6, 2007, Circular 78 requires all participants who are PRC citizens to register with and obtain approvals from SAFE prior to their participation in the plan. In addition, Circular 78 also requires PRC citizens to register with SAFE and make the necessary applications and filings if they participated in an overseas listed company’s covered equity compensation plan prior to April 6, 2007. We intend to adopt an equity compensation plan in the future and make option grants to our officers and directors, most of who are PRC citizens. Circular 78 may require our officers and directors who receive option grants and are PRC citizens to register with SAFE. We believe that the registration and approval requirements contemplated in Circular 78 will be burdensome and time consuming. If it is determined that any of our equity compensation plans are subject to Circular 78, failure to comply with such provisions may subject us and participants of our equity incentive plan who are PRC citizens to fines and legal sanctions and prevent us from being able to grant equity compensation to our PRC employees. In that case, our ability to compensate our employees and directors through equity compensation would be hindered and our business operations may be adversely affected. We have enjoyed certain preferential tax concessions and the loss of these preferential tax concessions may cause its tax liabilities to increase and its profitability to decline. Our operating subsidiary, Shenzhen Highpower, enjoyed preferential tax concessions in the PRC, which were only granted to high-technology enterprises operating in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. From 2005 to 2007, Shenzhen Highpower enjoyed a preferential income tax rate of 7.5% due to its status as a new business and high-tech enterprise. That status expired on December 31, 2007, when we then enjoyed a preferential tax rate of 15%. The expiration of the preferential tax treatment will increase our tax liabilities and reduce our profitability. Additionally, the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”) was enacted on March 16, 2007. Under the EIT Law, which became effective January 1, 2008, China adopted a uniform tax rate of 25.0% for all enterprises (including foreign-invested enterprises) and canceled several tax incentives enjoyed by foreign-invested enterprises. However, for foreign-invested enterprises established before the promulgation of the EIT Law, a five-year transition period is provided during which the tax rate will be gradually increased starting in 2008 and be equal to the new 25% tax rate at the end of the transition period. We believe that our profitability will be negatively affected in the near future as a result of the new EIT Law. Any future increase in the enterprise income tax rate applicable to us or other adverse tax treatments, could increase our tax liabilities and reduce our net income. Any recurrence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Avian Flu, or another widespread public health problem, in the PRC could adversely affect our operations. A renewed outbreak of SARS, Avian Flu or another widespread public health problem in China, where all of our manufacturing facilities are located and where the substantial portion of our sales occur, could have a negative effect on our operations. Our business is dependent upon its ability to continue to manufacture products. Such an outbreak could have an impact on our operations as a result of: · quarantines or closures of some of our manufacturing facilities, which would severely disrupt our operations, · the sickness or death of our key officers and employees, and · a general slowdown in the Chinese economy. 21 Any of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences of public health problems could adversely affect our operations. A downturn in the economy of the PRC may slow our growth and profitability. The growth of the Chinese economy has been uneven across geographic regions and economic sectors. There can be no assurance that growth of the Chinese economy will be steady or that any downturn will not have a negative effect on our business, especially if it results in either a decreased use of our products or in pressure on us to lower our prices. Because our business is located in the PRC, we may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal and financial controls, which it is required to do in order to comply with U.S. securities laws. PRC companies have historically not adopted a Western style of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, which includes strong corporate governance, internal controls and, computer, financial and other control systems. Most of our middle and top management staff are not educated and trained in the Western system, and we may difficulty hiring new employees in the PRC with such training. In addition, we may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in the PRC. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet Western standards. Therefore, we may, in turn, experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls which could impact the reliability of its financial statements and prevent us from complying with SEC rules and regulations and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any such deficiencies, weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Investors may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in China based upon U.S. laws, including the federal securities laws or other foreign laws against us or our management. Most of our current operations, including the manufacturing and distribution of our products, are conducted in China. Moreover, all of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of China or Hong Kong. All or substantially all of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States and in the PRC. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States or elsewhere outside China upon these persons. In addition, uncertainty exists as to whether the courts of China would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or such officers and/or directors predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in China against us or such persons predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof. RISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE The price of our common stock is volatile and you might not be able to resell your securities at or above the price you have paid. Prior to our initial public offering and listing of our common stock on the NYSE Amex on June 19, 2008, there was no public market for our securities in the United States. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop or be sustained or that the market price of our common stock will not decline. The price at which our common stock had traded has been highly volatile, with a high and low sales price of $1.68 and $8.35, respectively, as through March 27, 2009. You might not be able to sell the shares of our common stock at or above the price you have paid. The stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the performance of its listed companies. Moreover, only a limited number of our shares are traded each day, which could increase the volatility of the price of our stock. These market fluctuations might cause our stock price to fall regardless of our performance. The market price of our common stock might fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following: · actual or anticipated fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations; · changes in securities analysts’ expectations; 22 · variations in our operating results, which could cause us to fail to meet analysts’ or investors’ expectations; · announcements by our competitors or us of significant new products, contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; · conditions and trends in our industry; · general market, economic, industry and political conditions; · changes in market values of comparable companies; · additions or departures of key personnel; · stock market price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels; and · future sales of equity or debt securities, including sales which dilute existing investors. Shares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, as the future sale of a substantial amount of outstanding stock in the public marketplace could reduce the price of our common stock. In June 2008, we completed a public offering and sale of 603,750 shares of common stock, all of which are currently freely tradeable. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register a total of 1,772,745 shares of our common stock issued in a Private Placement that was conducted in connection with the Share Exchange in November 2007. The registration statement was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2008. The investors in the Private Placement also entered into a lock-up agreement pursuant to which they agreed not to sell their shares until ninety (90) days after our common stock was listed on the NYSE Amex, when one-tenth of their shares are released from the lock up, after which their shares will automatically be released from the lock up on a monthly basis pro rata over a nine month period. We also registered 817,479 shares of common stock held by certain of our stockholders immediately prior to the Share Exchange in the registration statement declared effective in June 2008. In addition, we registered a total of 959,649 shares of common stock that are held by affiliates of Westpark Capital, Inc. that were our stockholders prior to the Share Exchange pursuant to a registration statement that was declared effective in August 2008. All of the shares included in an effective registration statement as described above may be freely sold and transferred except if subject to a lock up agreement. Additionally, subject to lock-up agreements entered into with WestPark Capital, Inc. pursuant to which the former stockholders of HKHT and their designees agreed not to sell their shares until June 20, 2009, the former shareholders of HKHT and/or their designees may be eligible to sell all or some of our shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act (“Rule 144”), subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, a non-affiliate stockholder (or stockholders whose shares are aggregated) who has satisfied a six-month holding period, and provided that there is current public information available, may sell all of its securities. Rule 144 also permits the sale of securities, without any limitations, by a non-affiliate that has satisfied a one-year holding period. Any substantial sale of common stock pursuant to any resale prospectus or Rule 144 may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock by creating an excessive supply. A few principal stockholders have significant influence over us. Three of our stockholders beneficially own or control approximately 60.0% of our outstanding shares. If these stockholders were to act as a group, they would have a controlling influence in determining the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, election of directors, and other significant corporate actions. Such stockholders may also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control. In addition, without the consent of these three stockholders, we could be prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us. The interests of these three stockholders may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. 23 If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected. We are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely impact our public disclosures regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any failure of these controls could also prevent us from maintaining accurate accounting records and discovering accounting errors and financial frauds. Rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, and attestation of this assessment by our independent registered public accountants. The SEC extended the compliance dates for non-accelerated filers, as defined by the SEC. Accordingly, we included management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the previous fiscal year in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007. The attestation requirement of management’s assessment by our independent registered public accountants will first apply to our annual report for the 2009 fiscal year. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are new and complex, and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We may encounter problems or delays in completing activities necessary to make an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the attestation process by our independent registered public accountants is new and we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving an attestation of our assessment by our independent registered public accountants. If we cannot assess our internal control over financial reporting as effective, or our independent registered public accountants are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on such assessment, investor confidence and share value may be negatively impacted. In addition, management’s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure of management’s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting, or disclosure of our public accounting firm’s attestation to or report on management’s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. We may not be able to achieve the benefits we expect to result from the Share Exchange. On October 20, 2007, we entered into the Exchange Agreement with all of the shareholders of HKHT, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding securities of HKHT in exchange for shares of our common stock. On November 2, 2007, the Share Exchange closed, HKHT became our 100%-owned subsidiary and our sole business operations became that of HKHT. We also have a new Board of Directors and management consisting of persons from HKHT and changed our corporate name from SRKP 11, Inc. to Hong Kong Highpower Technology, Inc. We may not realize the benefits that we hoped to receive as a result of the Share Exchange, which include: · access to the capital markets of the United States; · the increased market liquidity expected to result from exchanging stock in a private company for securities of a public company that may eventually be traded; · the ability to use registered securities to make acquisition of assets or businesses; · increased visibility in the financial community; · enhanced access to the capital markets; · improved transparency of operations; and · perceived credibility and enhanced corporate image of being a publicly traded company. There can be no assurance that any of the anticipated benefits of the Share Exchange will be realized in respect to our new business operations. In addition, the attention and effort devoted to achieving the benefits of the Share Exchange and attending to the obligations of being a public company, such as reporting requirements and securities regulations, could significantly divert management’s attention from other important issues, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results or stock price in the future. 24 Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure will result in additional expenses. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the public markets and public reporting. Our management team will need to invest significant management time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies, which will lead to increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. Our common stock may be considered a “penny stock,” and thereby be subject to additional sale and trading regulations that may make it more difficult to sell. Our common stock may be considered to be a “penny stock” if it does not qualify for one of the exemptions from the definition of “penny stock” under Section 3a51-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Our common stock may be a “penny stock” if it meets one or more of the following conditions (i) the stock trades at a price less than $5.00 per share; (ii) it is NOT traded on a “recognized” national exchange; (iii) it is NOT quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or even if so, has a price less than $5.00 per share; or (iv) is issued by a company that has been in business less than three years with net tangible assets less than $5 million. The principal result or effect of being designated a “penny stock” is that securities broker-dealers participating in sales of our common stock will be subject to the “penny stock” regulations set forth in Rules 15-2 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. For example, Rule 15g-2 requires broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document at least two business days before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor’s account. Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor’s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult and time consuming for holders of our common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise. We do not foresee paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, as a result, our investors’ sole source of gain, if any, will depend on capital appreciation, if any. We do not plan to declare or pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future and currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth. As a result, you should not rely on an investment in our securities if you require the investment to produce dividend income. Capital appreciation, if any, of our shares may be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Moreover, you may not be able to resell your shares in our company at or above the price you paid for them. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. ITEM
