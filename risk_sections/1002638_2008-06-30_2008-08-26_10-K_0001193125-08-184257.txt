Item 1A. Risk Factors Risk Factors The following important factors could cause our actual business and financial results to differ materially from those results contained in forward-looking statements in this Annual report on Form 10-K or elsewhere by management from time to time. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies. 11 Table of Contents Our success depends on our relationships with strategic partners and distributors and any reduction in the sales efforts by distributors, or cooperative efforts from our partners, could materially impact our revenues We rely on close cooperation with partners for sales and product development as well as for the optimization of opportunities which arise in our competitive environment. As well, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the license of our products through third parties. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to maintain access to existing channels of distribution and to gain access to new channels if and when they develop. We may not be able to retain a sufficient number of our existing distributors or develop a sufficient number of future distributors. Distributors may also give higher priority to the sale of products other than ours (which could include competitors products) or may not devote sufficient resources to marketing our products. The performance of third party distributors is largely outside of our control and we are unable to predict the extent to which these distributors will be successful in marketing and licensing our products. A reduction in partner cooperation, sales efforts, a decline in the number of distributors, or a decision by our distributors to discontinue the sale of our products could materially reduce revenue If we do not continue to develop new technologically advanced products that successfully integrate with the software products and enhancements used by our customers, then future revenues will be negatively affected Our success depends upon our ability to design, develop, test, market, license and support new software products and enhancements of current products on a timely basis in response to both competitive threats and marketplace demands. In addition, new software products and enhancements must remain compatible with standard platforms and file formats. We must continue to enhance the capability of our Livelink software to enable users to form workgroups and collaborate on private intranets as well as on the Internet. Often, we must integrate software licensed or acquired from third parties with our proprietary software to create or improve our products. These products are important to the success of our strategy. If we are unable to achieve a successful integration with third party software, we may not be successful in developing and marketing our new software products and enhancements. If we are unable to successfully integrate the technologies to develop new software products and enhancements to existing products, or to complete products currently under development which we license or acquire from third parties, our operating results will materially suffer. In addition, if the integrated or new products or enhancements do not achieve acceptance by the marketplace, our operating results will materially suffer. Also, if new industry standards emerge that we do not anticipate or adapt to, our software products could be rendered obsolete and, as a result, our business, as well as our ability to compete in the marketplace, would be materially harmed. Our investment in our current research and development efforts may not provide a sufficient, timely return The development of ECM software products is a costly, complex and time-consuming process, and the investment in ECM software product development often involves a long gestation period until a return is achieved on such an investment. We make and will continue to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities. Investments in new technology and processes are inherently speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors including the degree of innovation of the products developed through our research and development efforts, sufficient support from our strategic partners, and effective distribution and marketing. Accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development. These expenditures may adversely affect our operating results if they are not offset by revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts in order to maintain our competitive position. However, significant revenue from new product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced for our current or historical products and services. 12 Table of Contents If our products and services do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to increase our revenues We intend to pursue our strategy of growing the capabilities of our ECM software offerings through our proprietary research and the development of new product offerings. In response to customer requests, we continue: (i) to enhance Livelink and many of our optional components; and (ii) to set the standard for ECM capabilities. The primary market for our software and services is rapidly evolving which means that the level of acceptance of products and services that have been released recently or that are planned for future release by the marketplace is not certain. If the markets for our products and services fail to develop, develop more slowly than expected or become subject to intense competition, our business will suffer. As a result, we may be unable to: (i) successfully market our current products and services, (ii) develop new software products, services and enhancements to current products and services, (iii) complete customer installations on a timely basis, or (iv) complete products and services currently under development. If our products and services are not accepted by our customers or by other businesses in the marketplace, our business and operating results will be materially affected. Current and future competitors could have a significant impact on our ability to generate future revenue and profits The markets for our products are intensely competitive, and are subject to rapid technological change and other pressures created by changes in our industry. We expect competition to increase and intensify in the future as the pace of technological change and adaptation quickens and as additional companies enter into each of our markets. Numerous releases of competitive products have occurred in recent history and may be expected to continue in the near future. We may not be able to compete effectively with current competitors and potential entrants into our marketplace. We could lose market share if our current or prospective competitors introduce new competitive products, add new functionality to existing products, acquire competitive products, reduce prices or form strategic alliances with other companies. If other businesses were to engage in aggressive pricing policies with respect to competing products, or if the dynamics in our marketplace resulted in increasing bargaining power by the consumers of our products and services, we would need to lower the prices we charge for the products we offer. This could result in lower revenues or reduced margins, either of which may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Consolidation in the industry, particularly by large, well capitalized companies, could hurt our ability to deliver goods and services at a competitive price, which could negatively impact our financial results of operations Recent acquisitions by some large, well-capitalized technology companies have materially altered the competitive landscape that we face. Acquisitions in the market have changed the marketplace for our goods and services by replacing competitors which are comparable in size to our company with larger and better capitalized companies. In addition, other large corporations with considerable financial resources either have products that compete with the products we offer, or have the ability to encroach on our competitive position within our marketplace. These companies have considerable financial resources; thus, they can engage in competition with our products and services on the basis of marketing, services or support. They also have the ability to introduce items that compete with our maturing products and services. The threat posed by larger competitors and the goods and services that these companies may be able to produce to our target customers at a lower cost may materially increase our expenses and reduce our revenues. Any material adverse effect on our revenue or cost structure may materially reduce the price of our Common Shares. Acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other business initiatives may negatively affect our operating results We continue to seek out opportunities to acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies that expand, complement or otherwise relate to our current business. We also consider, from time to time, 13 Table of Contents opportunities to engage in joint ventures or other business collaborations with third parties to address particular market segments. These activities create risks such as the need to integrate and manage the businesses and products acquired with our own business and products, additional demands on our management, resources, systems, procedures and controls, disruption of our ongoing business, and diversion of managements attention from other business concerns. Moreover, these transactions could involve: (i) substantial investment of funds; (ii) substantial investment with respect to technology transfers; and (iii) the acquisition or disposition of product lines or businesses. Also, such activities could result in one-time charges and expenses and have the potential to either dilute the interests of existing shareholders or result in the assumption of debt. Such acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or other business collaborations may involve significant commitments of financial and other resources of our company. Any such activity may not be successful in generating revenue, income or other returns to us, and the resources committed to such activities will not be available to us for other purposes. Our inability to address limited growth opportunities for products, as well our inability to address other risks associated with other acquisitions or investments in businesses, may negatively affect our operating results. Impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in an acquisition or in an investment, or charges to earnings associated with any acquisition or investment activity, may materially reduce our earnings which, in turn, may have an adverse material affect on the price of our Common Shares. In addition, if we assume debt in response to an acquisition or investment opportunity, the interest costs generated by the incremental debt obligation may materially increase our operating expenses which may materially and adversely affect our profitability as well as the price of our Common Shares. Businesses we acquire may have disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting that are weaker than or otherwise not in conformity with ours We have a history of acquiring businesses with varying levels of organizational size and complexity. Upon consummating an acquisition, we seek to implement our disclosure controls and procedures as well as our internal controls over financial reporting at the acquired company as promptly as possible. Depending upon the size and complexity of the business acquired, the implementation of our disclosure controls and procedures as well as the implementation of our internal controls over financial reporting at an acquired company may be a lengthy process. Typically, we conduct due diligence prior to consummating an acquisition; however, our integration efforts may periodically expose deficiencies in the disclosure controls and procedures as well as in internal controls over financial reporting of an acquired company. We expect that the process involved in completing the integration of our own disclosure controls and procedures as well as our own internal controls over financial reporting at an acquired business will sufficiently correct any identified deficiencies. However, if such deficiencies exist, we may not be in a position to comply with our periodic reporting requirements and, as a result, our business and financial condition may be materially harmed. We must continue to manage our internal resources during periods of company growth and increasing regulatory requirements or our operating results could be adversely affected Our markets have continued to evolve at a rapid pace. Moreover, we have grown significantly through acquisitions in the past and continue to review acquisition opportunities as a means of increasing the size and scope of our business. Finally, we have been subject to increased regulation, including various NASDAQ rules and Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 2002, which has necessitated a significant use of our resources to comply with the increased level of regulation on a timely basis. Our growth, coupled with the rapid evolution of our markets and more stringent regulations, has placed, and will continue to place, significant strains on our administrative and operational resources and increased demands on our internal systems, procedures and controls. Our administrative infrastructure, systems, procedures and controls may not adequately support our operations or compliance with such regulations. In addition, our management may not be able to achieve the rapid, effective execution of the product and business initiatives necessary to successfully implement our operational and competitive strategy and to comply with all regulations. If we are unable to manage growth effectively, or comply with such new regulations, our operating results will likely suffer. Our inability to manage growth or adapt to regulatory changes may also adversely affect our compliance with our periodic reporting 14 Table of Contents requirements or listing standards, which could result in the delisting of our Common Shares from the NASDAQ stock market or in our failure to comply with the rules and the regulations of the SEC. Changes in accounting rules and pronouncements may affect our reported earnings and operating income Generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations for many aspects of our business, such as revenue recognition for our products and services, accounting for investments, and treatment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets, are highly complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly change our reported earnings and could add significant volatility to those measures, but may have no effect on our generation of cash flow from operations. In addition, recently legislated requirements mandating the compulsory use of the International Financial Reporting Standards in Canada could materially impact our future reported earnings and recognized values of assets and liabilities. If we are not able to attract and retain top employees, our ability to compete may be harmed Our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could significantly harm our business. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. Our success is also highly dependent on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train, retain and motivate highly qualified management, technical, sales and marketing personnel. In particular, the recruitment of top research developers and experienced salespeople remains critical to our success. Competition for such people is intense, substantial and continuous, and we may not be able to attract, integrate or retain highly qualified technical, sales or managerial personnel in the future. In addition, in our effort to attract and retain critical personnel, we may experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher prices for our products or services. Our awards of stock options to employees may have an adverse impact on our operations A portion of our total compensation program for our executive officers and key personnel has historically included the award of options to buy our Common Shares. If the price of our Common Shares performs poorly, such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract critical personnel. In addition, any changes made to our stock option policies, or to any other of our compensation practices, which are made necessary by governmental regulations or competitive pressures could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel. Additionally, payments under our long-term incentive plan (instituted September 2007) to retain key executives are dependent to a significant extent upon the future price of our Common Shares and the growth of the future share price relative to certain peer companies. Any failure to achieve the expected future share price or growth relative to our peers could significantly reduce payments under the long-term incentive plan and materially impact our ability to retain these key executives. The length of our sales cycle can fluctuate significantly which could result in significant fluctuations in license revenue being recognized from quarter to quarter The decision by a customer to purchase our products often involves a comprehensive implementation process across our customers network or networks. As a result, licenses of these products may entail a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers, accompanied by the attendant risks and delays frequently associated with significant expenditures and lengthy sales cycle and implementation procedures. Given the significant investment and commitment of resources required by an organization to implement our software, our sales cycle may be longer compared to companies in other industries. Over the past several fiscal years, we have experienced a lengthening of our sales cycle as customers include more personnel in their decisions and focus on more enterprise-wide licensing deals. In an economic environment of reduced information technology spending, it may take several months, or even several quarters, for marketing opportunities to 15 Table of Contents materialize. If a customers decision to license our software is delayed or if the installation of our products takes longer than originally anticipated, the date on which we may recognize revenue from these licenses would be delayed. Such delays could cause our revenues to be lower than expected in a particular period. Our international operations expose us to business risks that could cause our operating results to suffer We intend to continue to make efforts to increase our international operations and anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. These international operations are subject to certain risks and costs, including the difficulty and expense of administering business and compliance abroad, compliance with domestic and foreign laws (including without limitation domestic and international import and export laws and regulations), costs related to localizing products for foreign markets, and costs related to translating and distributing products in a timely manner. International operations also tend to be subject to a longer sales and collection cycle. In addition, regulatory limitations regarding the repatriation of earnings may adversely affect the transfer of cash earned from foreign operations. Significant international sales may also expose us to greater risk from political and economic instability, unexpected changes in Canadian, United States or other governmental policies concerning import and export of goods and technology, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers. Additionally, international earnings may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction, which may materially adversely affect our effective tax rate. Also, international expansion may be more difficult, time consuming, and costly. As a result, if revenues from international operations do not offset the expenses of establishing and maintaining foreign operations, our operating results will suffer. Moreover, in any given quarter, foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our revenue, earnings or other financial measures. Unexpected operational restructuring or other events causing delays in sales transactions, or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems, may adversely affect our operations and may cause us to experience increased expenses or to generate expenses prior to the time we are able to recognize the revenue associated with the expenses incurred Our business and operations are highly automated and a disruption or failure of our system may delay our ability to complete sales and to provide services. As well, we incur operating expenses based upon anticipated revenue trends. Since a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed, a delay in recognizing revenue from transactions related to these expenses could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and, as a result, such a delay could materially reduce operating income. If these expenses are not subsequently followed by revenues, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we often undertake initiatives to restructure or streamline our operations. For example, in October 2006 we announced a restructuring initiative designed to integrate our operations with the operations of Hummingbird, which we acquired earlier that month. In such instances, we could incur costs associated with implementing the restructuring initiative beyond the amount contemplated when we first developed the initiative, and these increased costs may be substantial. Some of these restructuring costs may have to be treated as expenses which would decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those adjustments are made. We will continue to evaluate our operations, and may propose future restructuring actions as a result of changes in the marketplace, including the exit from less profitable operations or the decision to terminate services which are not valued by our customers. Any failure to successfully execute these initiatives on a timely basis may have a material adverse impact on our operations. Our products may contain defects that could harm our reputation, be costly to correct, delay revenues, and expose us to litigation Our products are highly complex and sophisticated and, from time to time, may contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct. Errors may be found in new software products or improvements to existing products after commencement of shipments to our customers. If these defects are discovered, we may not be able to successfully correct such errors in a timely manner. In addition, despite the 16 Table of Contents extensive tests we conduct on all our products, we may not be able to fully simulate the environment in which our products will operate and, as a result, we may be unable to adequately detect the design defects or software errors which may become apparent only after the products are installed in an end-users network. The occurrence of errors and failures in our products could result in the delay or the denial of market acceptance of our products; alleviating such errors and failures may require us to make significant expenditure of our resources. The harm to our reputation resulting from product errors and failures may be materially damaging. Since we regularly provide a warranty with our products, the financial impact of fulfilling warranty obligations may be significant in the future. Our agreements with our strategic partners and end-users typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to claims. These agreements usually contain terms such as the exclusion of all implied warranties and the limitation of the availability of consequential or incidental damages. However, such provisions may not effectively protect us against claims and the attendant liabilities and costs associated with such claims. Although we maintain errors and omissions insurance coverage and comprehensive liability insurance coverage, such coverage may not be adequate to cover all such claims. Accordingly, any such claim could negatively affect our financial condition. Failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete effectively We are highly dependent on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary rights. Although we hold certain patents and have other patents pending, our general strategy is to not seek patent protection. We intend to protect our rights vigorously; however, there can be no assurance that these measures will, in all cases, be successful. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights may be difficult, particularly in some nations outside of North America in which we seek to market our products. While U.S. and Canadian copyright laws, international conventions and international treaties may provide meaningful protection against unauthorized duplication of software, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of Canada or of the United States. The absence of internationally harmonized intellectual property laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for our proprietary rights. Software piracy has been, and is expected to be, a persistent problem for the software industry, and piracy of our products represents a loss of revenue to us. Certain of our license arrangements have required us to make a limited confidential disclosure of portions of the source code for our products, or to place such source code into an escrow for the protection of another party. Despite the precautions we have taken, unauthorized third parties, including our competitors, may be able to: (i) copy certain portions of our products; or (ii) reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Also, our competitors could independently develop technologies that are perceived to be substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. Our competitive position may be adversely affected by our possible inability to effectively protect our intellectual property. Other companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, which could materially increase costs and materially harm our ability to generate future revenue and profits Claims of infringement are becoming increasingly common as the software industry develops and as related legal protections, including patents are applied to software products. Although we do not believe that our products infringe on the rights of third-parties, third-parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future. Although most of our technology is proprietary in nature, we do include certain third party software in our products. In these cases, this software is licensed from the entity holding the intellectual property rights. Although we believe that we have secured proper licenses for all third-party software that is integrated into our products, third- parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future. Any such assertion may result in litigation or may require us to obtain a license for the intellectual property rights of third-parties. Such licenses may not be available, or they may not be available on reasonable terms. In addition, such litigation could be disruptive to our ability to generate revenue and may result in significantly increased costs as a result of our defense against those claims or our attempt to license the patents or rework our products to ensure they comply 17 Table of Contents with judicial decisions. Any of the foregoing could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to generate future revenue and profits. The loss of licenses to use third- party software or the lack of support or enhancement of such software could adversely affect our business We currently depend upon a limited number of third-party software products. If such software products were not available, we may experience delays or increased costs in the development of licenses for our products. For a limited number of product modules, we rely on software products that we license from third-parties, including software that is integrated with internally developed software and which is used in our products to perform key functions. These third-party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, and the related software may not continue to be appropriately supported, maintained, or enhanced by the licensors. The loss by us of the license to use, or the inability by licensors to support, maintain, and enhance any of such software, could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software is developed or licensed and integrated with internally developed software. Such increased costs or delays or reductions in product shipments could adversely affect our business. Our products rely on the stability of infrastructure software that, if not stable, could negatively impact the effectiveness of our products, resulting in harm to our reputation and business Our developments of Internet and intranet applications depend and will depend on the stability, functionality and scalability of the infrastructure software of the underlying intranet, such as the infrastructure software produced by Sun Microsystems, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, Oracle, Microsoft and others. If weaknesses in such infrastructure software exist, we may not be able to correct or compensate for such weaknesses. If we are unable to address weaknesses resulting from problems in the infrastructure software such that our products do not meet customer needs or expectations, our reputation, and consequently, our business may be significantly harmed. Our revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate which could materially impact the price of our Common Shares We experience, and we are likely to continue to experience, significant fluctuations in revenues and operating results caused by many factors, including:  Changes in the demand for our products and for the products of our competitors;  The introduction or enhancement of products by us and by our competitors;  Market acceptance of enhancements or products;  Delays in the introduction of products or enhancements by us or by our competitors;  Customer order deferrals in anticipation of upgrades and new products;  Changes in the lengths of sales cycles;  Changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;  Delays in product installation with customers;  Change in the mix of distribution channels through which products are licensed;  Change in the mix of products and services sold;  Change in the mix of international and North American revenues;  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and LIBOR rates; 18 Table of Contents  Acquisitions;  Restructuring charges taken in connection with any completed acquisition;  Changes in general economic and business conditions; and  Changes in general political developments, such as international trade policies and the war on terrorism. A general weakening of the global economy, or economic or business uncertainty created by North American or international political developments, could cancel or delay customer purchases. A cancellation or deferral of even a small number of licenses or delays in the installation of our products could have a material adverse effect on our operations in any particular quarter. As a result of the timing of product introductions and the rapid evolution of our business as well as of the markets we serve, we cannot predict whether patterns or trends experienced in the past will continue. For these reasons, you should not rely upon period-to-period comparisons of our financial results to forecast future performance. Our revenue and operating results may vary significantly and this possible variance could materially reduce the market price of our Common Shares. The volatility of our stock price could lead to losses by shareholders The market price of our Common Shares has been subject to wide fluctuations. Such fluctuations in market price may continue in response to: (i) quarterly and annual variations in operating results; (ii) announcements of technological innovations or new products that are relevant to our industry; (iii) changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; or (iv) other events or factors. In addition, financial markets experience significant price and volume fluctuations that particularly affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. These fluctuations have often resulted from the failure of such companies to meet market expectations in a particular quarter, and thus such fluctuations may or may not be related to the underlying operating performance of such companies. Broad market fluctuations or any failure of our operating results in a particular quarter to meet market expectations may adversely affect the market price of our Common Shares. Occasionally, periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities may lead to the institution of securities class action litigation against a company. Due to the volatility of our stock price, we may be the target of such securities litigation in the future. Such legal action could result in substantial costs to defend our interests and a diversion of managements attention and resources, each of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us From time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may become involved in various legal proceedings, including commercial, product liability, employment, class action and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the results of any such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities We are subject to income and other taxes in a variety of jurisdictions and our tax structure is subject to review by both domestic and foreign taxation authorities. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and of other tax liabilities requires significant judgment. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome with respect to the taxes we owe may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements, and this difference may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.
