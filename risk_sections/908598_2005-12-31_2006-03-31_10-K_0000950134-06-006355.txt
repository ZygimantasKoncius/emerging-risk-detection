ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Several important risks and uncertainties exist which could have an impact on our future operating results. These factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results or results that are reflected in any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These factors, and their impact on the success of our operations and our ability to achieve our goals, include the following: Market Fluctuations in the Semiconductor Industry Our business and results of operations depend upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of ICs and discrete electronic devices. As a result, our operating results are materially dependent upon economic and business conditions in the semiconductor industry. This industry has been subject to significant market fluctuations and has experienced periodic downturns, which often have had a disproportionate effect on capital equipment suppliers, such as Aetrium. In periods of excess capacity, the semiconductor industry sharply reduces purchases of capital equipment, such as our products. A downturn or slowdown in the semiconductor industry could substantially reduce our revenues and operating results and could harm our financial condition. There has been a trend of increasing revenues in the TAP segment of the 9 Table of Contents semiconductor equipment industry that began in the third quarter of 2005. This trend may not continue and a reversal of this trend could have a material and adverse impact on our operations. Successful Development and Introduction of New Products and Product Improvements We operate in an industry that is highly competitive with respect to timely product innovations. The market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. The development of more complex ICs has driven the need for new equipment and processes to produce such devices at an acceptable cost. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to anticipate and respond rapidly to changes in technologies, IC and discrete electronic device package types, market trends and industry standards. If we cannot successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced cost-effective products on a timely basis that are accepted in the marketplace, our business and operating results would likely suffer. Reliance on Significant Customers We rely on a limited number of customers for a substantial percentage of our net sales. A reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from one or more of these significant customers, or the loss of one or more of these customers, would likely have a negative impact on our operating results. Impact of Competitive Markets The markets for all of our main product lines are highly competitive. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and product development resources than we have. For most of our customers, we are not the sole supplier of our type of equipment. In addition, it is common for customers to evaluate more than one supplierÂ’s equipment for their emerging requirements. Accordingly, we are at significant risk to lose orders to competing suppliers, and even to being displaced as a supplier at potentially significant customers, which would likely have a negative impact on our operating results. Fixed Cost Constraints on Reduction of Expenses Many of our expenses, particularly those relating to properties, capital equipment and certain manufacturing overhead items, are fixed in the short term. Accordingly, reduced demand for our products and services causes our fixed production costs to be allocated across reduced production volumes, which negatively affects our gross margins and profitability. Our ability to reduce expenses is further constrained because we must continue to invest in research and development to maintain our competitive position and to maintain service and support for our existing customer base. Accordingly, in the event of a reduction in our revenues, resulting from an industry downturn or otherwise, we may not be able to maintain profitable operations. Impact of Cost Reduction Actions In the event of a sustained downturn and continuing decline in our revenues, we may implement cost reduction actions, such as workforce reductions, consolidation of operations, pay freezes and reductions, and reductions in other expenditures. In doing so, we would attempt to maintain the necessary infrastructures to allow us to take full advantage of subsequent improvements in conditions. However, there can be no assurance that reductions we may have made in personnel and expenditure levels and the loss of the capabilities of personnel we may have terminated would not inhibit us in the timely completion of product development efforts, the effective service of and responsiveness to customer requirements, and the timely ramp up of production in response to improving market conditions. 10 Table of Contents Impact of Changes in Securities Laws and Regulations We have made, and will need to continue to make, changes in our corporate governance and securities disclosure and compliance practices as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The SEC and the NASD have enacted, and we expect will continue to enact, new rules on a variety of subjects as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While we believe that we can ultimately comply with the new legislated requirements associated with being a public company, compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will increase our costs and may present new challenges and risks. These developments could also possibly make it more difficult and more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance. We may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage for our officers and directors, which may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified board members or executive officers. We are currently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs that may be incurred as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Reduction in the Sales Efforts by our Current Distributors We market and sell our test handlers and reliability test products outside of the United States primarily through international distributors that are not under our direct control. We have limited internal sales personnel. A reduction in the sales efforts by our current distributors, or the termination of one or more of these relationships with Aetrium, could negatively affect our operating results. Risks Inherent in our International Sales We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales. As a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in conducting business internationally, which if any of them occur could negatively impact our operating results. Supply of Significant Components for our Products Certain significant components used in our products, including certain contactor components, printed circuit boards, and refrigeration systems, are currently available only from sole or limited sources. We do not maintain long-term supply agreements with most of our suppliers and we purchase most of our components through individual purchase orders. Our inability to obtain components in required quantities or of acceptable quality could result in delays or reductions in our product introductions or shipments, which could damage our relationships with our customers and cause our operating results to suffer.
