ITEM 1A. Risk Factors Investors should consider carefully the following risk factors in addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we believe we have identified the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our results of operations. We may not achieve our growth, cost-reduction or margin expansion goals. We have established goals to improve our profitability by growing our sales with new and existing customers, reducing our expenses, and increasing our margins. If we do not achieve our growth objectives, the complexity of our global infrastructure makes it difficult to reduce our fixed cost structure to align with the size of our operations. Factors that could have a significant effect on our ability to achieve these goals include the following:  Failure to achieve our sales and margin growth objectives in our product lines and business units;  Failure to identify, consummate and integrate future acquisitions;  Declining gross margin reflecting competitive pricing pressures or product mix; and,  Limitations on our ability to leverage our support-function cost structure while maintaining an adequate structure to achieve our long-term growth objectives. We have historically incurred significant charges for inventory obsolescence, and may incur similar charges in the future. We maintain significant inventories in an effort to ensure that customers have a reliable source of supply. Our products generally support industrial machinery that is powered by tube technology. As technology evolves and this capital equipment is replaced, the market for our products potentially declines. In addition, the market for many of our other products is characterized by rapid change resulting from the development of new technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions by some of our suppliers and changing end-user demand, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of our inventory. We do not have many long-term supply contracts with our customers. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our customers or we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, our customers may not place orders with us, and we may accumulate significant inventories of products which we will be unable to sell or return to our vendors. This may result in a significant decline in the value of our inventory. We face competitive pressures in the markets we serve. We face many competitors, both global and local, in the markets we serve. Not only do we compete with other distributors, we also compete for customers with many of our own suppliers. Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including price, engineering capability, vendor representation, product diversity, lead times and the level of customer service. Our competition includes hundreds of electronic component distributors of various sizes, locations, and market focuses, as well as original equipment manufacturers and refurbishers. Some of our competitors have greater resources and broader name recognition than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to better withstand changing conditions within our markets and throughout the economy as a whole. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or a loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. A single stockholder has voting control over us. As of July 22, 2013, Edward J. Richardson, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, beneficially owned approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 67% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock. This share ownership permits Mr. Richardson to exert control over the outcome of stockholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, by-law amendments, possible mergers, corporate control contests, and other significant corporate transactions. 7 Table of Contents We depend on key management and employees, the loss of whom may prevent us from implementing our business plans, limit our profitability and decrease the value of our common stock. We are dependent on the talent and resources of our key executives and employees. In particular, the success of our business depends to a great extent on Edward J. Richardson, our President, Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of our Board of Directors. Mr. Richardson has extensive experience in the electron device industry, and his services are critical to our success. We have not obtained key man insurance with respect to Mr. Richardson or any of our executive officers. The loss of Mr. Richardson may prevent us from implementing our business plan, which may limit our profitability and decrease the value of our common stock. EDG is dependent on a limited number of vendors to supply it with essential products. EDGs principal products are vacuum tubes. These tubes and certain other products supplied by EDG are currently produced by a relatively small number of manufacturers. One of EDGs suppliers represents 16% of our total sales volume. Our success depends, in large part, on maintaining current vendor relationships and developing new relationships. We believe that some vendors supplying products to EDG product lines are consolidating their distribution relationships as a result of the declining market for vacuum tubes. To the extent that our significant suppliers reduce the volume of product they sell through distribution and are unwilling to continue to do business with us, or extend lead times, or limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on our business. International operations represent a significant percentage of our business and present a variety of unique risks which could impact our results of operations. Because we source and sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. These risks include the costs and difficulties of managing foreign entities, limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds, currency fluctuations, cultural differences that affect customer preferences and business practices, unstable political or economic conditions, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, changes in tax laws and difficulty in staffing global operations. We also face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because we conduct business outside of the U.S. Price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or may have an adverse effect on our margins. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries in which we sell our products, our U.S. dollar reported net revenue and income will decrease. We currently do not engage in any currency hedging transactions. We cannot predict whether foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries will have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in the future. Our products may be found to be defective or our services performed may result in equipment or product damage and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against us. Many of our components are sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. Additionally, we offer installation and repair services in conjunction with the selling of our components. Since a defect or failure in a product or service could give rise to failures in the equipment that incorporates them, we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the components involved in the claims. While we typically have provisions in our agreements with our suppliers that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and we and our suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions, our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of various factors, including the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where we do 8 Table of Contents business. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issues in the components sold by us if we are required to pay for the damages that result. Although we have product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount. Substantial defaults by our customers on our accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on our business. We extend credit to our customers. The failure of a significant customer or a significant group of customers to timely pay all amounts due could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on managements evaluation of factors which include such things as a customers financial condition, payment history and the availability of collateral to secure customers receivables. We may not be successful in identifying, consummating and integrating future acquisitions. As part of our growth strategy, our intent is to acquire additional businesses or assets. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates or complete the acquisition of identified candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms. Also, acquisitions are accompanied by risks, such as potential exposure to unknown liabilities and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. In addition, we may not obtain the expected benefits or cost savings from acquisitions. Acquisitions are subject to risks associated with financing the acquisition and integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or assets. If any of these risks materialize, they may result in disruptions to our business and the diversion of management time and attention, which could increase the costs of operating our existing or acquired businesses or negate the expected benefits of the acquisitions. Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins. Our revenues and gross profit margins depend significantly on global economic conditions, the demand for our products and services and the financial condition of our customers. Economic weakness and uncertainty have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenues and gross profit margins. Economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to forecast overall supply and demand with a great deal of confidence. Our operating results during Fiscal 2013 reflect a decline in sales volume, and there can be no assurance that we will experience a recovery in the near future; nor can there be any assurance that such worldwide economic volatility experienced recently will not continue. Major disruptions to our logistics capability could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Our global logistics services are operated through specialized and centralized distribution centers. We depend on third party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to our customers. A major interruption or disruption in service at any of our distribution centers for any reason (such as natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from our third party providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, operations and financial performance. We rely heavily on information technology systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect our business. Pursuant to a Transition Services Agreement with Arrow Electronics, Arrow provides IT services to us. We rely on these information systems to process, analyze, and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of our products, as well as to receive, process, bill, and ship orders on a timely basis. If the IT services provided by Arrow Electronics are not provided to us in an adequate manner, our ability to serve our customers and to perform other vital company functions may be affected. Arrows obligation to provide these IT services ends on March 1, 2014, although we have negotiated the right to extend the Agreement. We are in the process of migrating to a new ERP platform with the intent of completing the 9 Table of Contents migration prior to the termination date of the Transition Services Agreement. A significant disruption or failure in the design, implementation or support of the new information technology systems could disrupt our business, result in increased costs or decreased revenues, harm our reputation, or expose us to liability. To the extent we cannot timely complete this project, our business may suffer and we may incur significant additional costs. We may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees, and/or could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future. Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the display systems and electronics industries. From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. In any dispute involving products that we have sold, our customers could also become the target of litigation. We are obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend our customers if the products we sell are alleged to infringe any third partys intellectual property rights. In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, we may be able to seek indemnification from our suppliers for our self and our customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that we are fully protected against such claims. Any infringement claim brought against us, regardless of the duration, outcome or size of damage award, could result in substantial cost, divert our managements attention, be time consuming to defend, result in significant damage awards, cause product shipment delays; or require us to enter into royalty or other licensing agreements. Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful we may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase our operating expenses and harm our operating results and financial condition. Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all. We may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which could affect our ability to compete effectively. Potential lawsuits, with or without merit, may divert managements attention, and we may incur significant expenses in our defense. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, or determine to abandon certain lines of business, that may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately or timely. An effective internal control environment is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of our effort to prevent financial fraud. We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting. Based on these evaluations, we may conclude that enhancements, modifications or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including fraud, collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud. In addition, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or NASDAQ. Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. 10 Table of Contents If we are deemed to be an investment company, we will be required to meet burdensome compliance requirements and restrictions on our activities. Currently we have significant cash reserves. If we are deemed to be an investment company as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act), the nature of our investments may be subject to various restrictions. We do not believe that our principal activities subject us to the Investment Company Act. However, if we are deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with required additional regulatory burdens would increase our operating expenses. ITEM 1B.
