ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (cont'd) RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS (cont'd) THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LAWSUITS THAT COULD DIVERT ITS RESOURCES AND RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES. The Company's industry is characterized by frequent claims and related litigation regarding breach of contract and related issues. The Company is subject to a number of legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. The Company cannot assure that it will succeed in defending any claims, that judgments will not be entered against it with respect to any litigation or that reserves the Company may set aside will be adequate to cover any such judgments. If any of these actions or proceedings against the Company is successful, it may be subject to significant damages awards. In addition, the Company is the plaintiff in a number of material lawsuits in which it seeks the recovery of substantial payments. The Company is incurring significant legal fees in prosecuting these lawsuits, and it may not ultimately prevail in such lawsuits or be able to collect on such judgments if it does. In addition, the defense and prosecution of these claims divert the attention of the Company's management and other personnel for significant periods of time. As the largest manufacturer of large-format theater projection systems in the world, the Company has been the subject of anti-trust complaints and investigations in the past. The Company may be unsuccessful in defeating potential claims against it, and it may be sued or investigated on similar grounds in the future. BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS INCORPORATED IN CANADA, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR PLAINTIFFS TO ENFORCE AGAINST THE COMPANY LIABILITIES BASED SOLELY UPON U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. The Company is incorporated under the federal laws of Canada, some of its directors and officers are residents of Canada and a substantial portion of its assets and the assets of such directors and officers are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for United States' plaintiffs to effect service within the United States upon those directors or officers who are not residents of the United States, or to realize against them or the Company in the United States upon judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability under the United States federal securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for plaintiffs to bring an original action outside of the United States against the Company to enforce liabilities based solely on U.S. federal securities laws.
