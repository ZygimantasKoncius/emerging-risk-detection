ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The existing global economic and financial market environment has had, and may continue to have, a negative affect on our business and operations. Because demand for our services is sensitive to changes in the level of economic activity, our business has suffered during economic downturns. Many companies hire fewer employees when economic activity is slow. As a result, demand for our services is reduced, which leads to lower sales. If the economy does not fully recover or worsens, or unemployment remains at high levels, demand for our services and our sales may be further reduced. In addition, lower demand for our services may lead to lower prices for our services. The volatility in global financial markets may also limit our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions. Accordingly, if the economy does not fully recover or worsens, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We face risks relating to our foreign operations. We have a presence in approximately 55 countries around the world. We earned 45%, 42% and 42% of our total revenue outside of the United States in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Such amounts are generally collected in local currencies. In addition, we generally pay operating expenses in local currencies. Therefore, we are at risk for exchange rate fluctuations between such local currencies and the United States dollar. Global foreign exchange markets have been experiencing heightened volatility in recent quarters and we cannot predict the direction or magnitude of future currency fluctuations. A weakening of the currencies in which we generate sales relative to the currencies in which our costs are denominated may lower our results of operations. We are also subject to taxation in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, transactions between our foreign subsidiaries and us may be subject to United States and foreign withholding taxes. Applicable tax rates in foreign jurisdictions differ from those of the United States, and change periodically. The extent, if any, to which we will receive credit in the United States for taxes we pay in foreign jurisdictions will depend upon the application of limitations set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as well as the provisions of any tax treaties that may exist between the United States and such foreign jurisdictions. Our current or future international operations might not succeed or might fail to meet our expectations for a number of reasons, including:  general political uncertainty;  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;  competition from local recruiting services;  operational issues such as longer customer payment cycles and greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;  seasonal reductions in business activity;  language and cultural differences;  taxation issues;  complex legal and regulatory requirements that may be uncertain and may change; and  issues relating to uncertainties of laws and enforcement relating to the regulation and protection of intellectual property. 9 If we are forced to discontinue any of our international operations, we could incur material costs to close down such operations. Also, we could be exposed to fines and penalties under United States laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, we cannot be sure that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies. Any such violations could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our business and our operating results. Concerns regarding the European debt crisis and market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro could adversely affect the Companys business, results of operations and financing. Concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries. These concerns, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Companys euro- denominated assets and obligations and lead to future economic slowdowns. We rely on the value of our brands, particularly Monster, and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing. Our success depends on our brands and their value. Our business would be harmed if we were unable to adequately protect our brand names, particularly Monster. We believe that maintaining and expanding the Monster brand is an important aspect of our efforts to attract and expand our user and client base. We also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the growing number of Internet sites and the relatively low barriers to entry. We have spent considerable money and resources to date on the establishment and maintenance of the Monster brand. We are devoting substantial resources to advertising, marketing and other brand-building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of the Monster brand. Despite this, we may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of the Monster brand and, even if we are successful in our branding efforts, such efforts may not be cost-effective. If we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of the Monster brand in a cost-effective manner, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed significantly. We also are susceptible to others imitating our products and brands, particularly our Monster brand, and infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to successfully protect our intellectual property rights, upon which we are dependent. While we believe we have strong trademark protection in the Monster brand worldwide in the careers and recruitment business, that protection does not extend fully to other businesses. Other companies and organizations use the Monster name, and more may do so in the future. This use could adversely affect our brand recognition and reputation if employers or job seekers confuse us with these other organizations. In addition, the laws of foreign countries do not necessarily protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Imitation of our products or brands, particularly our Monster brand, or infringement of our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise reduce our revenues. Our markets are highly competitive. The markets for our services are highly competitive. They are characterized by pressures to:  reduce prices;  incorporate new capabilities and technologies; and  accelerate hiring timelines. Furthermore, we face competition from a number of sources. These sources include:  other employment-related websites, including large national and international competitors, niche career websites targeted at specific industry verticals, and jobs aggregator websites that aggregate job postings from multiple company websites and job boards;  professional networking and social networking websites;  general classified advertising websites, some of which offer a low-cost or free alternative to our offerings;  traditional media companies, including newspapers; and  Internet portals, search engines and general-interest websites such as blogs. 10 In addition to traditional competitors that provide products and services that are very similar to Monsters core products and services, we face increasing competition from a broad range of competitor types. Jobs aggregator websites have become a significant source of competition, as they permit job seekers to search multiple company websites and job boards. Professional networking websites have had significant success over the past several years in gaining large numbers of members and attracting employer customers with products that compete directly with our products. Low-cost and free classified advertising websites have also gained increased acceptance with employers. Additionally, many niche career websites have been launched targeted at specific industry verticals, and many industry blogs and websites now provide employment advertising opportunities for employers within specific industries. Some of our competitors or potential competitors may have greater financial resources, management, technological development, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. Some of our competitors have more diversified businesses or may be owned by entities engaged in other lines of business, allowing them to operate their directly competitive operations at lower margins than our operations. In addition, our ability to maintain our existing clients and attract new clients depends to a large degree on the quality of our services and our reputation among our clients and potential clients. Due to competition, we may experience reduced margins on our products and services, loss of market share or diminished use of our services by job seekers and our customers. If we are not able to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of these and other factors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed. We have no significant proprietary technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering the online advertising market. Existing or future competitors may develop or offer services and products that provide significant performance, price, creative or other advantages over our services. If we do not keep pace with product and technology advances, there could be a material adverse effect on our competitive position, revenue and prospects for growth. This could significantly harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations are a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:  the timing and amount of existing clients subscription renewals;  entering new markets;  enhancements to existing services;  the hiring cycles of employers;  changes in general economic conditions, such as recessions, that could, among other things, affect recruiting efforts generally and online recruiting efforts in particular;  the magnitude and timing of marketing initiatives;  the maintenance and development of our strategic relationships;  our ability to manage our anticipated growth and expansion;  our ability to attract and retain customers;  technical difficulties or system downtime affecting the Internet generally or the operation of our products and services specifically;  enhancements to technology to safeguard against security breaches; and  the timing and integration of our acquisitions. 11 We face risks relating to developing technology. The market for our products and services is characterized by rapid technological developments, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards. The emerging character of these products and services and their rapid evolution will require continuous improvement in the performance, features and reliability of our Internet and mobile content, particularly in response to competitive offerings. We may not be successful in responding quickly, cost effectively and sufficiently to these developments. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies or standards (including several different mobile and smart phone operating systems) could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our websites, applications and services. Each manufacturer or distributor of a mobile device or smart phone may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result. As new devices and new platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such devices. If we are slow to develop products and technologies that are compatible with such devices, we might fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for our products and services. This could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. New Internet services or enhancements that we have offered or may offer in the future may contain design flaws or other defects that could require expensive modifications or result in a loss of client confidence. Any disruption in Internet access or in the Internet generally could significantly harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Slower response times or system failures may also result from straining the capacity of our software, hardware or network infrastructure. To the extent that we do not effectively address any capacity constraints or system failures, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be significantly harmed. Trends that could have a critical impact on our success include:  rapidly changing technology in online recruiting;  evolving industry standards relating to online recruiting;  developments and changes relating to the Internet and mobile devices;  evolving government regulations;  competing products and services that offer increased functionality;  changes in employer and job seeker requirements; and  customer privacy protection concerning transactions conducted over the Internet. We rely heavily on our information systems and if our access to this technology is impaired, or we fail to further develop our technology, our business could be significantly harmed. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to store, retrieve, process and manage substantial amounts of information, including our client and candidate databases. To achieve our strategic objectives and to remain competitive, we must continue to develop and enhance our information systems. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt our information systems to evolving industry standards and to improve the performance and reliability of our information systems. This may require the acquisition of equipment and software and the development, either internally or through independent consultants, of new proprietary software. Our inability to design, develop, implement and utilize, in a cost-effective manner, information systems that provide the capabilities necessary for us to compete effectively could significantly harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. 12 Concerns relating to our privacy policies and our compliance with applicable data protection laws and regulations could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers, job seekers and other Internet users from using our products and services and subject us to fines. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation, which in turn could significantly harm our business, financial condition and operating results. While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Moreover, failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, requirements or our policies related to the collection, use, sharing or security of personal information or other privacy-related matters could result in a loss of confidence in us by customers, job seekers and other Internet users and could expose us to fines and penalties and could require us to expend significant sums in connection with any failure or perceived failure, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Laws related to data protection continue to evolve. It is possible that certain jurisdictions may enact laws or regulations that impact our ability to offer our products and services and/or result in reduced traffic or contract terminations in those jurisdictions, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Intrusions on our systems could damage our business. Despite our implementation of network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. Unauthorized access could jeopardize the security of information stored in our systems relating to our customers, job seekers and other website users, and can lead to phishing schemes whereby unauthorized persons pose as employers or Monster representatives and seek to obtain personal information from our customers and job seekers. In addition, malware or viruses could jeopardize the security of information stored or used in a users computer. We have experienced these intrusions in the past. We may also experience these intrusions in the future and may be required to expend significant sums and resources to safeguard against or remediate them. Moreover, negative publicity arising from any intrusion is damaging to our reputation and may adversely impact traffic to our sites. Accordingly, any intrusion could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Interruptions, delays or failures in the provision of our services could damage our brand and harm our operating results. Our systems are susceptible to outages and interruptions due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. Our systems continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. Customers, job seekers and other website users may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our services to them, including failures affecting our ability to serve web page requests without significant delay to the viewer. Sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our solutions to customers, job seekers and other Internet users and result in reduced traffic, contract terminations, fee rebates and make goods, thereby reducing revenue. Moreover, negative publicity arising from these types of disruptions is damaging to our reputation and may adversely impact traffic to our sites. We do not have multiple site redundancy for all of our services and some of our systems are not fully redundant in the event of any such occurrence. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of a geographical or other disaster impacting our business, we have distributed, and intend to continue assessing the need to distribute, our servers among additional data centers. Failure to execute these changes properly or in a timely manner could result in delays or interruptions to our service, which could result in a loss of users and damage to our brand, and harm our operating results. We may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any events that cause interruptions in our service. We are vulnerable to intellectual property infringement claims brought against us by others. Successful intellectual property infringement claims against us could result in monetary liability or a material disruption in the conduct of our business. We cannot be certain that our products, content and brand names do not or will not infringe valid patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We expect that infringement claims in our markets will increase in number. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of our business. If we were found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of a third party, we could be liable to that party for license fees, royalty payments, lost profits or other damages, and the owner of the intellectual property might be able to obtain injunctive relief to prevent us from using the technology or software in the future. If the amounts of these payments were significant or we were prevented from incorporating certain technology or software into our products, our business could be significantly harmed. 13 We may incur substantial expenses in defending against these third party infringement claims, regardless of their merit. As a result, due to the diversion of management time, the expense required to defend against any claim and the potential liability associated with any lawsuit, any significant litigation could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights or maintain our rights to use key technologies of third parties, our business may be harmed. A degree of uncertainty exists concerning the application and enforcement of trademark, trade dress and copyright laws to the Internet, and existing laws may not provide us adequate protection for our original content or the appearance of our Internet sites. In addition, because copyright laws do not prohibit independent development of similar content, copyright laws may not provide us with any competitive advantage. We have obtained patents and applied for other patents with respect to certain of our software systems, methods and related technologies, but our pending applications may not be granted and any patents issued to us may in the future be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under patents may not provide us with a competitive advantage. We also face risks associated with our trademarks, particularly trademarks covering the Monster brand. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights could involve significant expense and could be difficult or impossible, particularly given the global nature of the Internet and the fact that the laws of certain other countries may afford us little or no effective protection of our intellectual property. Moreover, a recent amendment to the United States patent law will become effective in 2012 and may affect our ability to protect our innovations and defend against claims of patent infringement. In addition, we rely on certain technology licensed from third parties, and may be required to license additional technology in the future for use in managing our Internet sites and providing related services to users and advertising customers. Our ability to generate fees from Internet commerce may also depend on data encryption, authentication and other technologies that we may be required to license from third parties. These third-party technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable commercial terms or at all. The inability to enter into and maintain any of these technology licenses could significantly harm our business, financial condition and operating results. If the Company could not replace its credit facilities upon expiration, the Companys liquidity would be significantly adversely affected. The Companys revolving and term credit facilities mature on December 21, 2012. The Company expects to be able to replace these credit facilities on or before their expiration. If due to the economic environment, the Companys performance or financial condition, or other factors the Company is unable to obtain replacement financing at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, the Companys liquidity would be significantly adversely affected and the Companys business, operating results and financial condition would be significantly adversely affected. We have made strategic acquisitions and entered into alliances and joint ventures in the past and intend to do so in the future. If we are unable to find suitable acquisitions or partners or to achieve expected benefits from such acquisitions or partnerships, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, growth rates and results of operations. As part of our ongoing business strategy we engage in discussions from time to time with third parties regarding, and enter into agreements relating to, possible acquisitions, strategic alliances and joint ventures. If we are unable to identify future acquisition opportunities or reach agreements with such third parties, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, growth rates and results of operations. Even if we are able to complete acquisitions or enter into alliances and joint ventures that we believe will be successful, such transactions, especially those involving companies like ChinaHR, are inherently risky. Our acquisitions can be accompanied by a number of risks, including:  the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of our acquired companies into our operations;  the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;  the difficulty of integrating acquired technology and rights into our services and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;  the impairment of relationships with customers and partners of the acquired companies or our customers and partners as a result of the integration of acquired operations;  the impairment of relationships with employees of the acquired companies or our employees as a result of integration of new management personnel; 14  the difficulty of integrating the acquired companies accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;  in the case of foreign acquisitions, uncertainty regarding foreign laws and regulations and difficulty integrating operations and systems as a result of cultural, systems and operational differences; and  the impact of known potential liabilities or unknown liabilities associated with the acquired companies. Our failure to be successful in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, incur unanticipated liabilities and significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations generally. We have had and may face future difficulties managing growth. Our business has experienced periods of rapid growth, both internally and through acquisitions. This expansion has resulted in substantial growth in the number of our employees, and put a significant strain on our management and operations. If our business experiences similar periods of rapid growth in the future, we expect it to result in increased responsibility for management personnel, and incremental strain on our operations, and financial and management systems. Our success under such conditions will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of senior management to operate effectively both independently and as a group. If we are not able to manage future growth, our business, financial condition and operating results may be significantly harmed. Our future growth depends on our ability to expand operations in international markets. We may have limited experience or we may need to rely on business partners in these markets, and our future growth will be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our international expansion efforts. We currently have a presence in approximately 55 countries around the world. Our future growth will depend significantly on our ability to expand Monster-branded product offerings in additional international markets. As we expand into new international markets, we will have only limited experience (if any) in marketing and operating our products and services in such markets. In other instances, including our CareerOne joint venture with News Limited in Australia, we have had to rely, and may have to continue to rely, on the efforts and abilities of foreign business partners in such markets. Certain international markets may be slower than domestic markets in adopting the online career and commerce medium and as a result, our operations in international markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment. Our business depends largely on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, including senior management. We are substantially dependent on the continued services of our senior management, including those executive officers set forth in the table in the Executive Officers section of this report. The loss of any of these individuals could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business is also dependent on our ability to retain, hire, motivate and develop talented, highly skilled personnel. Experienced management and technical, marketing and support personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired. We are required under generally accepted accounting principles to review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, slower growth rates in our industry or other materially adverse events. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined. This may adversely impact our results of operations. As of December 31, 2011, our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets were $1,184.1 million, which represented 58% of total consolidated assets. We refer the reader to Footnote 1 (in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the results of our annual impairment evaluation. 15 We estimate tax liabilities, the final determination of which is subject to review by domestic and international taxation authorities. We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the United States and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. We are also subject to review and audit by both domestic and foreign taxation authorities. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Effects of anti-takeover provisions could inhibit the acquisition of Monster Worldwide by others. Some of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could, together or separately:  discourage potential acquisition proposals;  delay or prevent a change in control; and/or  limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. In particular, our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of up to 800,000 shares of Preferred Stock with rights and privileges that might be senior to our Common Stock, without the consent of the holders of the Common Stock. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide, among other things, for advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations. There is volatility in our stock price. The market for our Common Stock has, from time to time, experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Factors such as announcements of variations in our quarterly financial results and fluctuations in revenue could cause the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate significantly. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for Internet-related companies in particular, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, many of whom have been granted equity compensation. The market price of our Common Stock can be influenced by stockholders expectations about the ability of our business to grow and to achieve certain profitability targets. If our financial performance in a particular quarter does not meet the expectations of our stockholders, it may adversely affect their views concerning our growth potential and future financial performance and, therefore, result in a drop in the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, if the securities analysts who regularly follow our Common Stock lower their ratings of our Common Stock, the market price of our Common Stock is likely to drop significantly. We face risks associated with government regulation. The application of existing laws and regulations to our websites relating to issues such as user privacy, security of data, defamation, advertising, taxation, promotions, content regulation, and intellectual property ownership and infringement can be unclear. In addition, we will also be subject to new laws and regulations directly applicable to our activities. Any existing or new legislation applicable to us could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, and dampen growth in Internet usage. The federal CAN-SPAM Act and state anti-spam laws impose certain requirements on the use of e-mail. The implications of these laws have not been fully tested. Portions of our business rely on e-mail to communicate with consumers on our behalf and for our clients. We may face risk if our use of e-mail is found to violate the federal law or applicable state law. We post our privacy policy and practices concerning the use and disclosure of user data on our websites. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy or other privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings which could potentially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In this regard, there are a large number of legislative proposals before the United States Congress, various state legislative bodies as well as various European Union institutions, bodies and agencies regarding privacy issues related to our business. It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted, and certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations through a decrease in user registrations and revenues. This could be caused by, among other possible provisions, the required use of disclaimers or other requirements before users can utilize our services. 16 Due to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate its transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws. We might unintentionally violate such laws or such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future. Any such developments (or developments stemming from enactment or modification of other laws) may significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Legal proceedings may significantly harm our business. From time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other proceedings in the ordinary course of business. It is possible that such litigation or proceedings may significantly harm our future results of operations or financial condition due to expenses we may incur to defend ourselves or the ramifications of an adverse decision.
