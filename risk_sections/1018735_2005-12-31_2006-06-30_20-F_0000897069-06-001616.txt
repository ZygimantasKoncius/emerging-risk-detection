Risk Factors Investing in our securities involves a significant degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information in our publicly filed documents, before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In such an event, the trading price of our Common Shares could decline and shareholders may lose part or all of their investment in our securities. Our clinical trials for our therapeutic products in development, such as NX-1207, may not be successful and we may not receive the required regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize these products. Products requiring regulatory approval, such as NX-1207, will be approved for commercial sale only if governmental regulatory authorities are satisfied that our clinical trials are properly designed and conducted and that the results of those trials provide valid and acceptable evidence that the product is safe and effective for the conditions or diseases it is intended to treat. We do not know whether our pending or any future clinical trials will demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals or will result in marketable products. Clinical trials are lengthy, complex, expensive and uncertain processes and failure can occur at any stage of testing. Results attained in pre-clinical testing and early clinical studies, or trials, may not be indicative of results that are obtained in later studies. We may suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier studies. Based on results at any stage of clinical trials, we may decide to repeat or redesign a trial or discontinue development of one or more of our product candidates. If we fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products under development, we will not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals to commercialize our product candidates. Failure to obtain such approval could cause the price of our shares to decline and adversely affect our business, operations, product development programs and financial condition. Our clinical trials for our therapeutic products, such as NX-1027, may be delayed, making it impossible to achieve anticipated development or commercialization timelines. Delays in the initiation, conduct or completion of clinical trials are not uncommon. If one or more of our clinical trials is delayed, we may not unable to meet our anticipated development or commercialization timelines. Either circumstance could cause the price of our shares to decline, increase clinical trial and product development costs, and affect the companys business, operations, product development programs and financial condition. The design, conduct and completion of clinical trials is a complex process involving many third parties, including governmental authorities, institutional review boards, contract manufacturers, contract research organizations (CROs), consultants, investigators, patients, and data monitoring committees. The initiation, progress, completion and success of a clinical trial is in part dependent on third parties providing necessary approvals, agreements and consents, performing necessary tasks in a timely, competent manner, and complying with protocols, good clinical practices and applicable laws, rules and regulations. Failure of a third party to perform as expected or agreed upon may result in delays or failure in initiating or completing a clinical trial. 4 Our clinical trials are subject to prior approvals and continuing oversight by governmental regulatory authorities and institutional review boards. We must meet and comply with their requirements in order to start, continue and successfully complete a clinical trial. We may not be able to comply with one or more of these requirements or there may be delays in doing so. A clinical trial may be put on hold or halted altogether due to concerns about patient safety. Governmental regulatory authorities may change approvals or requirements, resulting in changes to the design or conduct of a clinical trial or the need for new or further clinical trials. Clinical trials for our product candidates require that we identify and enroll a large number of patients with the disorder under investigation. We may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors including:  design of the protocol;  the size of the patient population;  eligibility criteria for the study in question;  perceived risks and benefits of the drug under study;  availability of competing therapies;  efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;  patient referral practices of physicians; and  availability of clinical trial sites. If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay or terminate ongoing clinical trials. A setback in any of our clinical trials would likely cause a drop in the price of our shares. We have successfully completed the first two Phase 1 and Phase 1-2 U.S. clinical trials for NX-1207, our drug candidate for the treatment of enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH), and are in the midst of a pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial. Setbacks in any phase of the clinical development of our product candidates could have a negative impact on our business, operations, product development programs and financial condition, could jeopardize FDA or other regulatory approval and would likely cause a drop in the price of our shares. We may not be able to make adequate arrangements with third parties for the commercialization of our product candidates, such as NX-1207. In order to commercialize our product candidates successfully, we intend, on a product-by-product basis, either to make arrangements with third parties to perform some or all of these services or to develop our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. We currently have limited marketing capabilities and limited experience in developing, training or managing a marketing or sales force. We currently rely upon distributors for the sales of our existing products. The cost of establishing and maintaining our own sales force would be substantial and may exceed its cost effectiveness. In addition, in marketing our products, we would likely compete with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Despite our marketing and sales efforts, we may be unable to compete successfully against these companies. We may make arrangements with third parties to market and sell some or all of our products under development in certain territories, rather than establish our own sales force. We may not be able to do so on favorable terms. If we contract with third parties for the sales and marketing of our products, our revenues will depend upon the efforts of these third parties, whose efforts may not be successful. We anticipate entering into co-development and co-marketing agreements with one or more partners with established sales, marketing and regulatory capabilities in order to assist in the completion of the development and commercialization of NX-1207. We may not be able to do so on favorable terms. If we fail to establish or make adequate arrangements with third parties for such purposes, our business, operations, product development programs and financial condition will be materially adversely affected. 5 We may not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce and expect. We make public statements regarding our estimates and projections for meeting milestones, such as the commencement and completion of clinical trials, anticipated regulatory submission and approval dates and time of product launch. The actual timing of these events can vary dramatically due to factors such as delays or failures in our clinical trials, the uncertainties inherent in the regulatory approval process and delays in achieving manufacturing or marketing arrangements sufficient to commercialize our products. There can be no assurance that our clinical trials will be completed, that we will make regulatory submissions or receive regulatory approvals as planned or that we will be able to adhere to our current schedule for the launch of any of our products. If we fail to achieve one or more of these milestones as planned, the price of our shares could decline. Even if we obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we will be subject to stringent ongoing government regulation. Even if regulatory authorities approve any of our product candidates, the manufacture, marketing and sale of such products will be subject to strict and ongoing regulation. Compliance with such regulation will be expensive and consume substantial financial and management resources. For example, an approval for a product may be conditioned on our conducting costly post-marketing follow-up studies. In addition, if based on these studies, a regulatory authority does not believe that the product demonstrates a benefit to patients, such authority could limit the indications for which the product may be sold or revoke the products regulatory approval. We and our contract manufacturers will be required to comply with applicable current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations for the manufacture of our products. These regulations include requirements relating to quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities must be approved before we can use them in commercial manufacturing of our products and are subject to subsequent periodic inspection by regulatory authorities. In addition, material changes in the methods of manufacturing or changes in the suppliers of raw materials are subject to further regulatory review and approval. If we or any marketing collaborators or contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to sanctions including fines, product recalls or seizures, injunctions, total or partial suspension of production, civil penalties, withdrawals of previously granted regulatory approvals and criminal prosecution. Any of these penalties could delay or prevent the development, marketing or sale of our products. It is Uncertain When, if Ever, We Will Make a Profit We first began operations in 1995 and are only in the early stages of commercial marketing of our diagnostic products, AlzheimAlert, NicAlert and TobacAlert. We have never made a profit. We incurred a net loss of $4.0 million in 2000, $3.0 million in 2001, $3.4 million in 2002, $4.3 million in 2003, $3.7 million in 2004 and $3.6 in 2005. As of December 31, 2005, Nymoxs accumulated deficit was $39.7 million. We cannot say when, if ever, Nymox will become profitable. Profitability will depend on our uncertain ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products and the licensing of our technology that will offset the significant expenditures required for us to advance our research, protect and extend our intellectual property and develop, manufacture, license, market, distribute and sell our technology and products successfully. Similar types of expenditures in the past have helped produce the net losses reported above. 6 We May Not Be Able to Raise Enough Capital to Develop and Market Our Products Nymox has funded its operations primarily by selling shares of its common stock. Since late 1998, a small portion of the funds came from sales. However, sales have not been, and may not be in the foreseeable future, sufficient to meet our anticipated financial requirements. We will continue to need to raise substantial amounts of capital for our business activities including our research and development programs, the conduct of clinical trials needed to obtain regulatory approvals and the marketing and sales of our products. We anticipate being able to fund our current total annual budgeted expenditures of approximately $3  4 million per year over the next year through our current cash position and additional financing, including draw downs through our common stock private purchase agreement with Lorros-Greyse Investments, Inc. Clinical trials will substantially increase cash requirements. We anticipate being able to meet these requirements as they arise. We plan to raise capital either through a new round of financing and/or through partnering with a major pharmaceutical company. Additional financing may not be available when needed, or, if available, may not be available on acceptable terms. If adequate funds on acceptable terms are not available, we may have to curtail or eliminate expenditures for research and development, testing, clinical trials, promotion and marketing for some or all of our products. We Face Challenges in Developing, Manufacturing and Improving Our Products Our success depends on our ability to develop or acquire rights to new products or to improve our existing products. We are still developing many of our products and have not yet brought them to market. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop or acquire rights to such products and to market them successfully. Developing a treatment for Alzheimers disease is particularly challenging. Many pharmaceutical companies, institutions and researchers are working on many different approaches and treatments. There is no consensus among researchers about the cause of this fatal illness and no guarantee that our drug development programs in this area are targeting significant factors in its cause, progression or symptoms. It is difficult to design drug candidates that can cross from the bloodstream into the brain, where the damage from Alzheimers disease is occurring. Clinical trials to establish efficacy for drugs that slow down the progression of Alzheimers disease over a period of months or years often require that a large number of subjects be tracked over many months or years, making them very expensive to conduct. The potentially long period from discovery and patenting through development and regulatory approval to the market can significantly reduce the patent life of an Alzheimers disease treatment. Any marketed treatment in this area may well eventually face competition from me-too drugs developed by other pharmaceutical companies based on our research. We will be under constant competitive pressure to improve our products and to develop new treatments in order to protect our position in the field. Developing and improving our diagnostic products is also challenging. The science and technology of the detection and measurement of very small amounts of biochemicals in bodily fluids and tissue is evolving rapidly. We may need to make significant expenditures in research and development costs and licensing fees in order to take advantage of new technologies. If any major changes to our testing technologies used in our AlzheimAlert and NicAlert and TobacAlert tests are made, further validation studies will be required. Developing new diagnostic products is more challenging, requiring identification and validation of the biochemical marker being detected by the new product in the clinical context and the development and validation of the product designed to detect the marker. 7 We anticipate outsourcing at least some of the manufacturing required for new products we may develop in order to control start-up and operating costs and to take advantage of the existing manufacturing capabilities and capacity in the large contract manufacturing sectors in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries. There are risks associated with this strategy, including difficulties in the transfer of manufacturing, the possibility of production interruption due to causes beyond our control and the need to arrange alternative suppliers. We currently out-source some of the manufacturing services required for our NicAlert and TobacAlert products to a contract manufacturer. We do not anticipate any significant risk of long-term interruption of manufacture due to this arrangement. The services supplied are not unique or unduly complicated and other contract manufacturers are available to provide similar services. The manufacture of therapeutics is more challenging and capital-intensive and may require us to partner with a major pharmaceutical company or other partner in order to manufacture a therapeutic for market. Our Products and Services May Not Receive Necessary Regulatory Approvals. Our diagnostic products, AlzheimAlert, NicAlert and TobacAlert, and our products in development, are subject to a wide range of government regulation governing laboratory standards, product safety and efficacy. The actual regulatory schemes in place vary from country to country and regulatory compliance can take several years and involve substantial expenditures. We cannot be sure that we can obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, for our products in development and all of the following could have a material adverse effect on our business:  failure to obtain or significant delays in obtaining requisite approvals;  loss of or changes to previously obtained approvals; and  failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements. We currently market AlzheimAlert as a clinical reference laboratory service provided by our government inspected clinical reference laboratory in New Jersey. Physicians send us urine samples from their patients to our laboratory where the AlzheimAlert test is performed and the results reported back to the physicians. A clinical laboratory test like AlzheimAlert does not require approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Our laboratory is regulated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and is subject to inspection and certification. In addition, individual states like New York and Florida have their own requirements for reference laboratories like ours that offer diagnostic services. In addition, the FDA has its own regulations governing in vitro diagnostic products, including some of the reagents used in clinical reference laboratories. Any changes in CMS or state law requirements or in the FDA regulations could have a detrimental impact on our ability to offer or market any reference laboratory services and/or on our ability to obtain reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and providers. We have developed a diagnostic kit based on AlzheimAlert for sale to third parties. We will require prior approval from the FDA before we can market, distribute or sell this product in the United States. In July, 2005, an FDA advisory panel voted 5-2 against approval of the kit, citing the need for further studies, such as long term follow-up and autopsy confirmation. The Company continues to pursue kit approval and is still in the process of working with the FDA to try to meet all the requirements. We cannot predict with any certainty when or if such approval will be forthcoming and it is possible that the FDA may require more clinical testing or further documentation before approval. If approved, the diagnostic kit would then be subject to postmarketing record and reporting obligations and manufacturing requirements. 8 Similar requirements exist in many other countries. Obtaining these approvals and complying with the subsequent regulatory requirements can be both time-consuming and expensive. In November 2004, Nymox satisfactorily completed the testing and registration required by European regulatory, environmental and quality standards in order to obtain a CE Mark for the AlzheimAlert kit. The CE Mark makes the AlzheimAlert kit eligible for sale in the European Union and will allow European clinical and hospital laboratories to perform the AlzheimAlert test in their own facilities in Europe. We currently sell NicAlert and TobacAlert as tests for tobacco product use and exposure and for research use. In October, 2002, we received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for our NicAlert product for medical uses. In the United States, our drugs in development will require final FDA approval before their sale or distribution. Such approval comes only at the end of a lengthy, expensive and often arduous process. We have not submitted any drugs for final FDA approval. In 2003, we successfully completed the first two Phase 1 and Phase 1-2 U.S. clinical trials for NX-1207, our investigational new drug treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). We are in the midst of a pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial. We cannot predict with any certainty the outcome of this trial, what further steps may be required in order to apply for final FDA approval for this drug or whether the FDA will ultimately grant us such approval. Similar requirements exist in many other countries. We Face Significant and Growing Competition The modern pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive, particularly in the field of Alzheimers disease where there is a large unmet need for an effective treatment. Currently there are five drugs with similar mechanisms of action approved for sale in the United States (Aricept®, Cognex®, Exelon®, Reminyl® and Namenda). These drugs offer some relatively short-term symptomatic relief, but do not treat the underlying causes of the illness. Over the past decade, there has been an intense research effort both in the non-profit sectors such as universities, government agencies and research institutes and in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry to develop new treatments for Alzheimers disease. Treatment candidates under development include:  vaccines for Alzheimer's disease;  enzyme-blocking therapies intended to block the production of the protein found in the senile plaques characteristic of Alzheimers disease. A number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies including Amgen, Elan and Bristol-Myers Squibb are working on such therapies.  drugs aimed at reducing, blocking or clearing the aggregation or accumulation of the protein found in senile plaques. A number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies including Neurochem, Praecis Pharmaceuticals and Prana Biotechnology are working on such therapies.  memory enhancing compounds from Cortex Pharmaceuticals, Memory Pharmaceuticals, Helicon Therapeutics and Sention, among others.  drugs aimed at inhibiting an enzyme that breaks down an important neurotransmitter involved in memory and cognition. A number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies including Axonyx are working on such therapies.  implantation of a shunt (COGNIShunt) developed by its maker, Eunoe Inc., and designed to drain cerebrospinal fluid from the patients skull into his or her abdominal cavity. There is also ongoing research into possible methods of preventing Alzheimers disease such as taking certain cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins, estrogen replacement therapies, anti-oxidants such as vitamin E and ginkgo biloba or anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (e.g., Advil or Motrin). The successful development of a treatment or method of preventing Alzheimers disease could significantly impact on our ability to develop or market a competing treatment for Alzheimers disease. 9 Our treatments under development for enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH) face significant competition from existing products. There are seven drugs approved for treatment of BPH: finasteride (Proscar®), dutasteride (Avodart®), terazozin (Hytrin®), doxazozin (Cardura®), tamsulosin (Flomax®), prazosin (Minipres®) and alfusozin (Uroxatral®). There are a number of thermal treatments on the market designed to shrink the enlarged prostate by heating its tissue with a device inserted through the urethra (the tube leading from the bladder through the penis through which men urinate) or through the abdomen. The devices on the market use microwave energy (Prostatron®, Targis Therapy® or TherMatrx®), low level radiowaves (TUNA System®), lasers (Indigo LaserOptic Treatment System® or Laserscope GreenLight PVP), direct heat, energy or hot water to heat or burn away prostate tissue. A variety of surgical procedures exist to surgically reduce or remove the prostate or to widen the urethra. These include procedures to cut away prostate tissue such as TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) and using a resectoscope with an electrical loop inserted through the penis to cut the prostate tissue. A small device used to widen the constricted urethra called a prostatic stent can also be inserted. The diagnostic testing industry is also highly competitive. In the area of Alzheimers disease, Athena Diagnostics, Inc. markets diagnostic tests for different biochemical indicators found in blood and spinal fluid and for genetic predispositions for the illness. Other companies are attempting to develop and market other diagnostic products in this area. The introduction of other diagnostics products for Alzheimers disease or tobacco product use that are cheaper, easier to perform, more accurate or otherwise more attractive to the physicians, health care payers or other potential customers would have a significant impact on the sales of our AlzheimAlert, NicAlert or TobacAlert products. We May Not Be Able to Successfully Market Our Products To increase our marketing, distribution and sales capabilities both in the United States and around the world, we will need to enter into licensing arrangements, contract sales agreements and co-marketing deals. We cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into agreements with other companies on terms acceptable to us, that any licensing arrangement will generate any revenue for the company or that the costs of engaging and retaining the services of a contract sales organization will not exceed the revenues generated. Protecting Our Patents and Proprietary Information is Costly and Difficult We believe that patent and trade secret protection is important to our business, and that our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain strong patents, to maintain trade secret protection and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Obtaining and maintaining our patent position is costly. We pay for the filing, prosecution and fees of over 200 patents and patent applications in countries around the world, including the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea. In the United States alone, Nymox has seventeen patents issued or allowed and fourteen patent applications pending relating to its technology. Its subsidiary, Serex, Inc. has ten patents issued and allowed. Through licensing agreements with the Massachusetts General Hospital, Nymox separately licensed global patent rights relating to neural thread proteins and to novel cancer markers that have potential application both for the treatment and diagnosis of specific cancers. These licensed patent rights include six issued United States patents and numerous patents and patent applications in other countries around the world. 10 We believe that we have strong patent protection for the products we sell and for our product development programs and are in the process of extending that patent protection to cover more countries or new discoveries or products. We cannot assure you that additional patents covering new products or improvements will be issued or that any new or existing patents will be of commercial benefit or be valid and enforceable if challenged. Many companies have patents covering various drugs, methods and discoveries in the fields of diagnostics and therapeutics for Alzheimers disease and related conditions and of new anti-infective agents. We believe that the patents issued to date will not preclude Nymox from developing and marketing our products; however, it is impossible to predict the extent to which licenses from third parties will be necessary. If Nymox were to need licenses from third parties there can be no assurance that we could obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In the fields of diagnostic methods and diagnostic tests for common human diseases and conditions, where Serex has many of its patents, there are many patents issued covering many areas of diagnostic methods, tests and technologies. We believe that these patents issued to date to other companies will not preclude Serex from developing and marketing its products but you should be aware that it is often difficult to determine the nature, breadth and validity of competing patent claims in these fields, that there has been significant litigation in some of these areas (not involving Serex) and that, if and when Serexs products become more commercially successful, Serexs products or patents may become the subject matter of litigation. If Serex were to need licenses from third parties there can be no assurance that it could obtain such license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We are not currently involved in patent litigation. In the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry patent disputes are frequent and can preclude the commercialization of products. Patent litigation is costly and the outcome often difficult to predict. It can expose us to significant liabilities to third parties and may require us to obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or product in dispute. We Face Changing Market Conditions The healthcare industry is in transition with a number of changes that affect the market for therapeutic and diagnostic test products. The U.S. Federal and various state governments have under consideration a number of proposals that may have the effect of directly or indirectly limiting drug prices in the U.S. markets. Such changes may adversely affect the prices we may charge for any therapeutic drug we develop. Funding changes and budgetary considerations can lead major health care payers and providers to make changes in reimbursement policies for our AlzheimAlert product. These changes can seriously impact the potential for growth for the market for AlzheimAlert, either favorably when the decision is to offer broad coverage for our test at a reasonable price or negatively when the decision is to deny coverage altogether. Changes in the healthcare delivery system have resulted in major consolidation among reference laboratories and in the formation of multi-hospital alliances, reducing the number of institutional customers for therapeutic and diagnostic test products. There can be no assurance that Nymox will be able to enter into and/or sustain contractual or other marketing or distribution arrangements on a satisfactory commercial basis with these institutional customers. Health Care Plans May Not Cover or Adequately Pay for our Products and Services Throughout the developed world, both public and private health care plans are under considerable financial and political pressure to contain their costs. The two principal methods of restricting expenditures on drugs and diagnostic products and services are to deny coverage or, if coverage is granted, to limit reimbursement. For single-payer government health care systems, a decision to deny coverage or to severely restrict reimbursement for one of our products can have an adverse effect on our business and revenues. 11 In the United States, where, to a significant degree, the patient population for our products is elderly, Medicare and Medicaid are sources of reimbursement. In general, any restriction on reimbursement, coverage or eligibility under either program could adversely affect reimbursement to Nymox for products and services provided to beneficiaries of the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs. Many elderly people are covered by a variety of private health care organizations either operating private health care plans or Medicare or Medicaid programs subject to government regulation. These organizations are also under considerable financial constraints and we may not be able to secure coverage or adequate reimbursement from these organizations. Without coverage, we will have to look to the patients themselves who may be unwilling or unable to pay for the product; in turn, doctors may be reluctant to order or prescribe our products in the absence of coverage of the product for the patient. The Issuance of New Shares May Dilute Nymoxs Stock The issuance of further shares and the eligibility of issued shares for sale will dilute our common stock and may lower its share price. There were 27,710,464 common shares of Nymox issued and outstanding as of June 26, 2006. All of these shares are eligible for sale under Rule 144 or are otherwise freely tradable. In addition, 1,711,500 share options are outstanding, of which 1,701,500 are currently vested. Expiry dates for Nymox options range from 2 months to 10 years (see note 7(e) to our consolidated financial statements). These options have been granted to employees, officers, directors and consultants of the company. Moreover, Nymox may use its shares as currency in acquisitions. We Face Potential Losses Due to Foreign Currency Exchange Risks Nymox incurs certain expenses, principally relating to salaries and operating expenses at its Canadian head office, in Canadian dollars. All other expenses are derived in U.S. dollars. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of losses due to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. We protect ourselves against this risk by maintaining cash balances in both currencies. We do not currently engage in hedging activities. We cannot say with any assurance that the Company will not suffer losses as a result of unfavorable fluctuations in the exchange rates between the United States dollar and Canadian dollar. We Have Never Paid a Dividend and are Unlikely to do so in the Foreseeable Future Nymox has never paid any dividends and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. We expect to retain any earnings or positive cash flow in order to finance and develop Nymoxs business.
