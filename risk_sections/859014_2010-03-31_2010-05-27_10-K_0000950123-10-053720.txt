ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that we believe affect us are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or focused on or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our common stock could decline significantly, and shareholders could lose all or part of their investment. The majority of our products segment revenue is dependent on our customers continued use of International Business Machines Corporation and IBM-compatible products. The majority of our revenue from software products is generated from products designed for use with IBM and IBM-compatible mainframe operating systems. As a result, the majority of our revenue from software products is dependent on our customers continued use of these systems. In addition, because our products operate in conjunction with IBM operating systems software, changes to IBMs mainframe operating systems may require us to adapt our products to these changes. IBM also provides competing products designed for use with their mainframe operating systems. A decline in our customers use of IBM and IBM-compatible mainframe operating systems, delays or the inability to keep our products current with changes to IBMs mainframe operating systems, or the loss of market share to IBMs competing products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. Our product revenue is dependent on the acceptance of our pricing structure for software licenses, maintenance services and web performance services. The pricing of our software licenses, maintenance services and web performance services is under constant pressure from customers and competitive vendors that can negatively impact our product revenue. These competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. Maintenance revenue could continue to decline. Our maintenance revenue has been negatively affected by reduced pricing for mainframe maintenance renewals and the decline in new mainframe maintenance arrangements. If we are unable to increase new product sales and maintenance contract renewals to outpace the combined impact of maintenance cancellations, reduced pricing for maintenance renewals and currency fluctuations, our maintenance revenues will continue to decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. The markets for web performance services are at an early stage of development with emerging competitors. If these markets do not develop or develop more slowly than we expect, or if there is an increase in competition, our revenue may decline or fail to grow. We derive revenue from providing on-demand web performance services. While web applications have become increasingly significant for a growing number of companies, the market for web performance services is in an early stage of development, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Growth in revenue generated from these services will depend on the willingness of organizations to increase their use of web performance services. Some businesses may be reluctant or unwilling to use these services for a number of reasons, including failure to perceive the need for improved testing and monitoring of web applications and lack of knowledge about the potential benefits these services may provide. This market is also competitive and rapidly changing, and several of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be more efficient and effective at achieving the following principal competitive factors affecting the market for web performance services: real-time availability of data and reporting, the proven performance, security, scalability, flexibility and reliability of services offered; the usability of services offered, including ease of implementation and use; and pricing. If we are less successful at achieving one or more of these factors than our competitors or the 18 Table of Contents demand for web performance services declines or does not grow, we may lose market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. The market for application services is in its early stages of development with emerging competitors. As the market matures, competition may increase and could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. Several of our competitors in the application services market have substantially greater financial, marketing, recruiting and training resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be more efficient and effective at achieving the following principal competitive factors affecting the market for application services: speed of implementation, reduced risk related to regulatory compliance and implementation problems, inclusion of state of the art technology features, solution performance, ability to meet customer service level requirements and price. If we are less successful at achieving one or more of these factors than our competitors, we may lose market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. If we are not successful in implementing our professional services strategy, our operating margins may decline materially. Our business strategy for the professional services segment is to improve the segments operating margin by requiring certain margin thresholds for all new business and managing the segment operating expenses accordingly. If our customers will not accept the higher billing rates necessary to achieve these minimum thresholds, our revenues and operating margins may be negatively impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. We may fail to achieve our forecasted financial results due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other unpredictable factors. If we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price could decline substantially. Our revenues, particularly our software license revenues, are difficult to forecast. Software license revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in the quarter. Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate the sales forecast. Our sales forecast estimates could prove to be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time as a significant amount of our transactions are completed during the final weeks and days of the quarter. Therefore, we generally do not know whether revenues or earnings will have met expectations until after the end of the quarter. Also, the manner in which our customers license our products can cause revenues to be deferred or recognized ratably over time and changes in the mix of customer agreements could adversely affect our revenues. As a result, our actual financial results can vary substantially from our forecasted results. In addition, investors should not rely on the results of prior periods or on historical seasonality in license revenue as an indication of our future performance. Our operating expense levels are relatively fixed in the short-term and are based, in part, on our expectations of future revenue. If we have unanticipated lower sales in any given quarter, we will not be able to reduce our operating expenses for that quarter proportionately in response. Therefore, net income may be disproportionately affected by a fluctuation in revenue. Any significant shortfall in revenues or earnings; or lowered expectations could cause our common stock price to decline. 19 Table of Contents Future changes in the United States and global economies may reduce demand for our products and services, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results. Our revenues and profitability depend on the overall demand for our software products, web performance services, professional services and application services. Regional and global economic change and uncertainty have resulted in companies reassessing their spending for technology projects. If the economies within the United States and/or other geographic regions in which we operate experience a slowdown or recession, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. Defects or disruptions in our web performance services or application services networks or interruptions or delays in service would impair the delivery of our on-demand service and could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability. Defects in our web performance services or application services networks could result in service disruptions for our customers. Our network performance and service level could be disrupted by numerous events, including natural disasters and power losses. We might inadvertently operate or misuse the system in ways that could cause a service disruption for some or all of our customers. We might have insufficient redundancy or server capacity to address any such disruption, which could result in interruptions in our services or degradations of our service levels. Our customers might use our web performance services in ways that cause a service disruption for other customers. These defects or disruptions could undermine confidence in our services and cause us to lose customers or make it more difficult to attract new ones, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. Future changes in the U.S. domestic automotive manufacturing business could reduce demand for our professional services and application services, which may have a material negative effect on our revenues and operating results. A substantial portion of our worldwide professional services revenue, which includes the professional services segment and the application services segment, has been generated from customers in the automotive industry, with General Motors Company currently being our largest customer. Many of our customers in the domestic automotive industry are engaged in restructuring and other efforts to cut costs, including IT expenditures. Further negative developments in this industry, including additional bankruptcies, could reduce the demand for our services and increase the collection risk of accounts receivables from these customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our professional and application services results of operations and operating margin in this business. If the fair value of our long-lived assets deteriorated below the carrying value of these assets, recognition of an impairment loss would be required, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results. We evaluate our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, goodwill, acquired product rights and other intangible assets, whenever events or circumstances occur that may indicate these assets are impaired or periodically as required by generally accepted accounting principles. In the continuing process of evaluating the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets, there is the possibility that we could identify a substantial impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our software technology may infringe the proprietary rights of others. Our software technology is developed or enhanced internally or acquired through acquisitions. All employees sign an agreement that states the employee was hired for his or her talent and skill rather than for any trade secrets or proprietary information of others of which he or she may have knowledge. Further, our employees execute an agreement stating that work developed for us or our clients belongs to us or our clients, respectively. 20 Table of Contents During the due diligence stage of any software technology acquisition, we research and investigate the title to the software technology we will be acquiring from the seller. This investigation generally includes without limitation, litigation searches, copyright and trademark searches, review of development documents and interviews with key employees of the seller regarding development, title and ownership of the software technology being acquired. The acquisition document itself generally contains representations, warranties and covenants concerning the title and ownership of the software technology as well as indemnification and remedy provisions in the event the representations, warranties and covenants are breached by the seller. Although we use all reasonable efforts to ensure we do not infringe on third party intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us with respect to our current and future software technology or that any such assertion will not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation. Our results could be adversely affected by increased competition, pricing pressures and technological changes within the software products market. The markets for our software products are highly competitive. We consider over 40 firms to be directly competitive with one or more of our products and several of these have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for our software products include: responsiveness to customer needs, functionality, performance, reliability, ease of use, quality of customer support, sales channels, vendor reputation and price. A variety of external and internal events and circumstances could adversely affect our competitive capacity. Our ability to remain competitive will depend, to a great extent, upon our performance in sales, product development and customer support. To be successful in the future, we must respond promptly and effectively to our customers purchasing methodologies, challenges of technological change and our competitors innovations by continually enhancing our product offerings. We operate in an industry characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. If we fail to keep pace with technological change in our industry, such failure would have an adverse effect on our revenues. During the past several years, many new technological advancements and competing products entered the marketplace. To the extent that our current product portfolio does not meet such changing requirements, our revenues will suffer. Delays in new product introductions or less-than-anticipated market acceptance of these new products are possible and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Developers of third party products, including operating systems, databases, systems software, applications, networks, servers and computer hardware, frequently introduce new or modified products. These new or modified third party products could incorporate features which perform functions currently performed by our products or could require substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with these companies hardware or software. While we have generally been able to adapt our products and our business to changes introduced by new or modified third party product offerings, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. Failure to adapt our products in a timely manner to such changes or customer decisions to forego the use of our products in favor of those with comparable functionality contained either in the hardware or other software could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. The market for professional services is highly competitive, fragmented and characterized by low barriers to entry. We have numerous competitors in the professional services markets in which we operate. Several of these competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, recruiting and training resources than we do. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for our professional services include responsiveness to customer needs, breadth and depth of technical skills offered, availability and productivity of personnel, ability to demonstrate achievement of results and price. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future. 21 Table of Contents We must develop or acquire product enhancements and new products to succeed. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop product enhancements and new products that keep pace with continuing changes in technology and customer preferences. The majority of our products have been developed from acquired technology and products. We believe that our future growth lies, in part, in continuing to identify, acquire and then develop promising technologies and products. While we are continually searching for acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in identifying, acquiring and developing products and technology. If any potential acquisition opportunities are identified, there can be no assurance that we will consummate and successfully integrate any such acquisitions and there can be no assurance as to the timing or effect on our business of any such acquisitions. Our failure to develop technological improvements or to adapt our products to technological change may, over time, have a material adverse effect on our business. Acquisitions may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business or divert the attention of our management and may result in financial results that are different than expected. As part of our overall strategy, we have acquired or invested in, and plan to continue to acquire or invest in, complementary companies, products, and technologies and may enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies. Risks commonly encountered in such transactions include: the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the combined companies; the risk that we may not be able to integrate the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies; the potential disruption of our ongoing business; the inability to retain key technical, sales and managerial personnel; the inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful integration of acquired businesses; the risk that revenues from acquired companies, products and technologies do not meet our expectations; and decreases in reported earnings as a result of charges for in-process research and development and amortization of acquired intangible assets. For us to maximize the return on some of our investments in acquired companies, the products of these entities must be integrated with our existing products. These integrations can be difficult and unpredictable, especially given the complexity of software and that acquired technology is typically developed independently and designed with no regard to integration. The difficulties are compounded when the products involved are well-established because compatibility with the existing base of installed products must be preserved. Successful integration also requires coordination of different development and engineering teams. This too can be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product integration efforts or that we will realize the expected benefits. With each of our acquisitions, we have initiated efforts to integrate the disparate cultures, employees, systems and products of these companies. Retention of key employees is critical to ensure the continued development, support, sales and marketing efforts pertaining to the acquired products. We have implemented retention programs to keep many of the key technical and sales employees of acquired companies. Nonetheless, we have lost some key employees and may lose others in the future. We are exposed to exchange rate risks on foreign currencies and to other international risks that may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Over one-third of our total revenues are derived from foreign operations and we expect that foreign operations will continue to generate a significant percentage of our total revenues. Products and services are generally priced in the currency of the country in which they are sold. Changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies or exchange controls may adversely affect our results of operations. The international business is also subject to other risks, including the need to comply with foreign and U.S. laws and the greater difficulty of managing business overseas. In addition, our foreign operations are affected by general economic conditions in the international markets in which we do business. A worsening of economic conditions in these markets could cause customers to delay or 22 Table of Contents forego decisions to license new products or to reduce their requirements for professional and application services. Current laws may not adequately protect our proprietary rights. We regard our software as proprietary and attempt to protect it with copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws and/or restrictions on disclosure, copying and transferring title. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We have many patents and many patent applications pending. However, existing patent and copyright laws afford only limited practical protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Any claims against those who infringe on our proprietary rights can be time consuming and expensive to prosecute, and there can be no assurance that we would be successful in protecting our rights despite significant expenditures. The loss of certain key employees and technical personnel or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our success depends in part upon the continued service of our key senior management and technical personnel. Such personnel are employed at-will and may leave Compuware at any time. Our success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, managerial and sales personnel. The market for professional services and software products personnel has historically been, and we expect that it will continue to be, intensely competitive. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. The loss of certain key employees or our inability to attract and retain other qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. Unanticipated changes in our operating results or effective tax rates, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities, could affect our profitability. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. One of the components that need to be evaluated is the realization of our deferred tax assets. We must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Changes in estimates of projected future operating results or in assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income could result in significant increases to our valuation allowance and tax expense that would reduce net income. In addition, we recognize reserves for uncertain tax positions through tax expense for estimated exposures related to our current tax positions. We evaluate the need for reserves for uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and any change in the amount will be recorded in our results of operations, as appropriate. It could take several years to resolve certain of these reserves for uncertain tax positions. We are also subject to routine corporate income tax audits in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our provision for income taxes includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that are likely to result from the examination of our corporate tax returns that have been filed in these jurisdictions. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these examinations could be materially different from the amounts included in the provision for income taxes and result in increases to tax expense. Our stock repurchase plan may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in our stock price. We have repurchased shares of our common stock in the market during the past several years and currently repurchase shares under an arrangement pursuant to which management is permitted to determine the amount and timing of repurchases in its discretion subject to an overall limit. Our ability and willingness to repurchase shares is subject to, among other things, the availability of cash resources and credit at rates and upon terms we believe are prudent. Stock market conditions, the market value of our common stock and other factors may also make it imprudent for us from time to 23 Table of Contents time to engage in repurchase activity. There can be no assurance that we will continue to repurchase shares at historic levels or at all. If our repurchase program is curtailed, our stock price may be negatively affected. Acts of terrorism, acts of war and other unforeseen events may cause damage or disruption to us or our customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Natural disasters, acts of war, terrorist attacks and the escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or otherwise may have negative and significant effects, such as imposition of increased security measures, changes in applicable laws, market disruptions and job losses. Such events may have an adverse effect on the economy in general. Moreover, the potential for future terrorist attacks and the national and international responses to such threats could affect the business in ways that cannot be predicted. The effect of any of these events or threats could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our articles of incorporation, bylaws and rights agreement as well as certain provisions of Michigan law may have an anti-takeover effect. Provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, Michigan law and the Rights Agreement, dated October 25, 2000, as amended, between Compuware Corporation and Equiserve Trust Company, N.A. (now known as Computershare Trust Company N.A.), as rights agent, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Compuware, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to shareholders. The combination of these provisions inhibits a non-negotiated acquisition, merger or other business combination involving Compuware, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
