D. Risk Factors Risk Relating to Our Structure, Shares and American Depositary Shares Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, restrict our ability to react to changes to our business, and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt. On November 10, 2013, we entered into a share and asset agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, with Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc., or NVD, and, solely as a Guarantor, Novartis Corporation, or Novartis, which was subsequently amended on December 27, 2013 and January 9, 2014 to acquire Novartis diagnostic business. The transactions contemplated by the Novartis Agreement are referred to herein as the Novartis Acquisition. In connection with the Novartis Acquisition, we (i) entered into a credit and guaranty agreement dated as of February 24, 2014 (as amended, the New Credit Facilities), which consists of the Senior Term Loans and the Revolving Loans and (ii) issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2022 (the Notes). As of the date of this annual report on Form 20-F, no amounts have been drawn on the Revolving Loans. As of December 31, 2013, after giving pro forma effect to the Novartis Acquisition, the entry into the New Credit Facilities and the offering of the Notes and we would have $5.4 billion of indebtedness outstanding. See Item 5 of this Part I, Operating and Financial Review and 5 Table of Contents Prospects  B. Liquidity and Capital Resources  Sources of Credit, for terms of the New Credit Facilities and Notes and for more detailed information. Our high level of indebtedness could have significant adverse effects on our business, including the following: · make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding debt; · make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business; · our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate purposes may be impaired; · we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our indebtedness, which will reduce the funds available to us for operations and other purposes; · all of the indebtedness outstanding under our purchase money indebtedness, equipment financing, and real estate mortgages will have a prior ranking claim on the underlying assets; · our ability to fund a change of control offer may be limited; · place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt; · our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited; and · we may be restricted from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting other business opportunities. We expect to use cash flow from operations to pay our expenses and amounts due under our outstanding indebtedness. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future and our anticipated growth in revenue and cash flow may not be realized, either or both of which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not have enough money, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt, sell assets or borrow more money. We may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements, including the New Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Notes, may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. The failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to achieve any of these alternatives could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Despite our substantial indebtedness, we may still incur significantly more debt. This could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage. We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. Our business is capital intensive, and we regularly seek additional capital. Although the indenture governing the Notes and the New Credit Facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions, including secured debt, could be substantial. Adding additional debt, including under the New Credit Facilities, to current debt levels could exacerbate the leverage related risks described above. For more information on our indebtedness, see Item 5 of this Part I, Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  B. Liquidity and Capital Resources  Sources of Credit. To service our indebtedness and other obligations, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. A significant reduction in our operating cash flows resulting from changes in economic conditions, increased competition or other events beyond our control could increase the need for additional or alternative sources of liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and our ability to service our debt and other obligations. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such as reducing capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing 6 Table of Contents our indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital. We cannot assure you that any of these alternative strategies could be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or that they would yield sufficient funds to make required payments on our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the New Credit Facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity such indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the New Credit Facilities and our Notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Covenants in our debt agreements restrict our business in many ways. The agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations applicable to us contain various covenants, with customary caveats, that limit our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things: · incur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons; · issue redeemable stock and preferred equity; · pay dividends to the shareholders of Grifols, S.A. or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock; · prepay, redeem or repurchase debt; · make loans, investments and capital expenditures; · enter into agreements that restrict distributions from our restricted subsidiaries; · sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries; · enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and · consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our New Credit Facilities and/or our Notes. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the New Credit Facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the New Credit Facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the New Credit Facilities. If the lenders under the New Credit Facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay the New Credit Facilities and our other indebtedness, including our Notes. Our borrowings under the New Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease. Our ability to meet our financial obligations depends on our ability to receive dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries. Our principal assets are the equity interests that we hold in our operating subsidiaries. As a result, we are dependent on dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, including the payment of principal and interest on our outstanding debt. Our subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable us to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness. In addition, any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on dividends or, in the case of foreign subsidiaries, restrictions on repatriation of earnings under applicable local law and monetary transfer restrictions in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. In addition, payments to us by our subsidiaries will be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings. Our subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of our indebtedness to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict payments from those subsidiaries to us. We cannot assure you that agreements governing current and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit those subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient cash to fund payments on our indebtedness when due. 7 Table of Contents Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and, except for existing and future subsidiaries that will be guarantors of certain indebtedness, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due on our debt or to make funds available to us for such payment. We are a foreign private issuer under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, thus, are exempt from a number of rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are permitted to file less information with the Securities and Exchange Commission than a company incorporated in the U.S. As a foreign private issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act, including the proxy rules, which impose certain disclosure and procedural requirements for proxy solicitations. Moreover, we are not required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, as frequently or as promptly as U.S. companies with securities registered under the Exchange Act; we are not required to file financial statements prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles; and we are not required to comply with SEC Regulation FD, which imposes certain restrictions on the selective disclosure of material information. In addition, our officers, directors and principal shareholders are not subject to the reporting or short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act or the rules under the Exchange Act with respect to their purchases and sales of our Class A shares or Class B shares. Accordingly, you may receive less information about us than you would receive about a company incorporated in the U.S. and may be afforded less protection under the U.S. federal securities laws than you would be afforded with respect to a company incorporated in the U.S. If we lose our status as a foreign private issuer at some future time, we will no longer be exempt from such rules and, among other things, will be required to file periodic reports and financial statements as if we were a company incorporated in the U.S. The costs incurred in fulfilling these additional regulatory requirements could be substantial. Additionally, pursuant to The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or NASDAQ, Listing Rules, as a foreign private issuer, we may elect to follow our home country practice in lieu of the corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ Listing Rule 5600 Series, with the exception of those rules that are required to be followed pursuant to the provisions of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5615(a)(3). We have elected to follow Spanish practices in lieu of the requirements of the NASDAQ Listing Rule 5600 Series to the extent permitted under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5615(a)(3). See Item 16.G. of Part II, Corporate Governance. If we discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, it may adversely affect our ability to provide timely and reliable financial information and satisfy our reporting obligations under U.S. federal securities laws, which also could affect the market price of our American Depositary Shares or our ability to remain listed on NASDAQ. Effective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention of those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting. To the extent that any material weakness or significant deficiency exists in our or our consolidated subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting, such material weakness or significant deficiency may adversely affect our ability to provide timely and reliable financial information necessary for the conduct of our business and satisfaction of our reporting obligations under U.S. federal securities laws, which could affect our ability to remain listed on NASDAQ. Ineffective internal and disclosure controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our American Depositary Shares, or ADSs, or the rating of our debt. The Grifols family may exercise significant influence over the conduct of our business. The Grifols family and Scranton Enterprises B.V. own, directly and indirectly, 35.3% of our Class A shares. The Class A shares exercise 100% of voting control of our company. As a result, the Grifols family and Scranton Enterprises B.V. may exercise significant influence over matters requiring shareholders approval, including, among other things, the election of our board of directors, or Board, dividend policy and certain fundamental corporate action, such as the issuance of bonds, a merger or a dissolution. Conflicts may arise between the interests of the principal shareholders and those of the other shareholders, and the principal shareholders may choose to resolve the conflict in a way that does not coincide with the interests of the other shareholders. 8 Table of Contents The market price of our Class B ADSs on NASDAQ may be volatile. The market price of our Class B ADSs may be volatile as a result of various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: · market expectations for our financial performance; · actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition; · changes in the estimates of our results of operations by securities analysts; · potential or actual sales of blocks of our Class B ADSs in the market by any shareholder or short selling of our Class B ADSs. Any such transaction could occur at any time or from time to time, with our without notice; · the entrance of new competitors or new products in the markets in which we operate; · volatility in the market as a whole; and · the risk factors mentioned in this section. The market price of our Class B ADSs may be adversely affected by any of the preceding or other factors regardless of operations and financial condition. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro may increase the risk of holding our ADSs or shares. The Spanish securities market for equity securities consists of four stock exchanges located in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia, or, collectively, the Spanish Stock Exchanges. The majority of the transactions conducted on the Spanish Stock Exchanges are done through the Spanish Automated Quotation System (Sistema de Inteconexión Bursátil Español, or SIBE). Our Class A shares and Class B shares are listed on the Spanish Stock Exchanges and quoted on the Spanish Automated Quotation System in euro. In addition, our Class B shares are traded in the U.S. on the NASDAQ Global Select Market in the form of ADSs, evidenced by American Depositary Receipts, or ADRs, in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro may result in temporary differences between the value of our ADSs and the value of our shares, which may result in heavy trading by investors seeking to exploit such differences. This may increase the volatility of, and have an adverse effect on, the price of our shares or ADSs. In addition, as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the proceeds that a holder of our ADSs would receive upon the sale in Spain of any shares withdrawn from the ADR depositary and the U.S. dollar equivalent of any cash dividends paid in euro on our shares represented by the ADSs could also decline. Subscription (or preemptive) rights may be unavailable to U.S. holders of our shares or ADSs. In the case of a future increase of our registered share capital, existing shareholders will generally be entitled to subscription (or preemptive) rights pursuant to Spanish law, unless waived by a resolution of the shareholders or, if such power has been delegated to the Board pursuant to a shareholders resolution, by a resolution of the Board and except in certain situations, such as capital increases made for an in-kind contribution, in which subscription (or preemptive) rights are not applicable by law. Holders of the Class B shares will generally not have a right to vote on any resolution on a capital increase or on the waiver of subscription (or preemptive) rights, unless such resolution does not treat the Class B shares in the same way as the Class A shares, except in the limited circumstances set out in the Articles of Association of Grifols, S.A., or Articles of Association. Even if preemptive rights are granted, holders of our ADSs or U.S. resident shareholders may not be able to exercise subscription (or preemptive) rights, in which case holders of our ADSs could be substantially diluted, unless a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, or Securities Act, is effective with respect to such rights and the shares for which they give such right or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available. We intend to evaluate at the time of any rights offering the costs and potential liabilities associated with any such registration requirements, as well as the benefits of enabling the exercise of subscription (or preemptive) rights for the shares. In doing so, we will also evaluate any other factors that we may consider appropriate at the time. There can be no assurance that we will decide to comply with such registration requirements. If no such registration requirements are satisfied, the depositary will sell the subscription (or preemptive) rights relating to the ADSs on deposit and will 9 Table of Contents distribute the proceeds of such sale, if any, to the holders of the ADSs. If the depositary is unable to sell rights that are not exercised or not distributed or if the sale is not lawful or reasonably practicable, it will allow the rights to lapse, in which case no value will be given for these rights. ADS holders may be subject to limitations on the transfer of their ADSs. ADSs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of ADSs generally when the books of the depositary are closed or if such action is deemed necessary or advisable by the depositary or by us because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body or commission or under any provision of the deposit agreement. Moreover, the surrender of ADSs and withdrawal of our shares may be suspended subject to the payment of fees, taxes and similar charges or if we direct the depositary at any time to cease new issuances and withdrawals of our shares during periods specified by us in connection with shareholders meetings, the payment of dividends or as otherwise reasonably necessary for compliance with any applicable laws or government regulations. Your ability to enforce civil liabilities under U.S. securities laws may be limited. We are a company organized under the laws of Spain, and many of our subsidiaries are also incorporated outside of the U.S. A substantial portion of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries are located outside of the U.S. In addition, nearly all of our directors and officers and certain of our subsidiaries officers are nationals or residents of countries other than the U.S., and all or a substantial portion of such persons assets are located outside the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the U.S. upon us or certain subsidiaries or their directors or officers with respect to matters arising under the Securities Act or to enforce against them judgments of courts of the U.S. predicated upon civil liability under the Securities Act. It may also be difficult to recover fully in the U.S. on any judgment rendered against such persons or against us or certain of our subsidiaries. In addition, there is doubt as to the enforceability in Spain of original actions, or of actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts of liabilities, predicated solely upon the securities laws of the U.S. If a judgment was obtained outside Spain and efforts were made to enforce the judgment in Spain, there is some doubt that Spanish courts would agree to recognize and enforce a foreign judgment. Accordingly, even if you obtain a favorable judgment in a U.S. court, you may be required to re-litigate your claim in Spain. Risks Relating to Our Business Our manufacturing processes are complex and involve biological intermediates that may be susceptible to contamination and variations in yield. Plasma is a raw material that is susceptible to damage and contamination and may contain human pathogens, any of which would render the plasma unsuitable for further manufacturing. For instance, contamination or improper storage of plasma by us or third-party suppliers may require us to destroy some of our raw material. If unsuitable plasma is not identified and discarded prior to its release to our manufacturing processes, it may be necessary to discard intermediate or finished product made from that plasma or to recall any finished product released to the market, resulting in a charge to cost of goods sold. The manufacture of our plasma products is an extremely complex process of fractionation (separating the plasma into component proteins), purification, filling and finishing. Our products can become non-releasable or otherwise fail to meet our specifications through a failure of one or more of our product testing, manufacturing, process controls and quality assurance processes. We may detect instances in which an unreleased product was produced without adherence to our manufacturing procedures or plasma used in our production process was not collected or stored in a compliant manner consistent with cGMP regulations or other regulations, which would likely result in our determination that the impacted products should not be released and therefore should be destroyed. Once we have manufactured our plasma-derived products, they must be handled carefully and kept at appropriate temperatures. Our failure, or the failure of third parties that supply, ship or distribute our products, to properly care for our plasma-derived products may require that such products be destroyed. While we expect to write off small amounts of work in process inventories in the ordinary course of business due to the complex nature of plasma, our processes and our products, unanticipated events may lead to write-offs and other costs materially in excess of our expectations. Such write-offs and other costs could cause material fluctuations in our profitability. Furthermore, contamination of our products could cause investors, consumers or other third parties with whom we conduct business to lose confidence in the reliability of our manufacturing procedures, which could adversely affect sales and profits. In addition, faulty or 10 Table of Contents contaminated products that are unknowingly distributed could result in patient harm, threaten the reputation of our products and expose us to product liability damages and claims. Due to the nature of plasma, there will be variations in the biologic properties of the plasma we collect or purchase for fractionation that may result in fluctuations in the obtainable yield of desired fractions, even if cGMP regulations are followed. Lower yields may limit production of our plasma-derived products due to capacity constraints. If such batches of plasma with lower yields impact production for extended periods, it may reduce the total capacity of product that we could market and increase our cost of goods sold, thereby reducing our profitability. Our manufacture of intermediate immunoassay antigens and antibodies to screen human donated blood and blood products is also a complex biologic process, subject to substantial production risks. Once our products are approved and marketed, we must continually monitor them for signs that their use may result in serious and unexpected side effects, which could jeopardize our reputation and our ability to continue marketing our products. We may also be required to conduct post-approval clinical trials as a condition to licensing a product. As for all pharmaceutical products, the use of our products sometimes produces undesirable side effects or adverse reactions or events, or, collectively, adverse events. For the most part, these adverse events are known, are expected to occur at some frequency and are described in the products labeling. Known adverse events of a number of our products include allergic or anaphylactic reactions including shock and the transmission of infective agents. Further, the use of certain products sometimes produces additional adverse events, which are detailed below. · The use of albumin sometimes produces the following adverse events: hypervolemia, circulatory overload, pulmonary edema, hyperhydration and allergic manifestations including urticaria, chills, fever and changes in respiration, pulse and blood pressure. · The use of blood clotting factor ix, or Factor IX, sometimes produces the following adverse events: the induction of neutralizing antibodies; thromboembolism, including myocardial infarction; disseminated intravascular coagulation; venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism; and, in the case of treatment for immune tolerance induction, nephrotic syndrome. · The use of the antihemophilic blood clotting factor, or Factor VIII, sometimes produces the following adverse events: the induction of neutralizing antibodies, thromboembolic events and hemolytic anemia or hemolysis. · The use of IVIG sometimes produces the following adverse events: nausea, vomiting, asthenia, pyrexia, rigors, injection site reaction, allergic or anaphylactic reaction, aseptic meningitis, arthralgia, back pain, dizziness, headache, rash, pruritus, urticaria, hemolysis or hemolytic anemia, hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity and hyponatremia, thromboembolic reactions such as myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thromboses, transfusion-related acute lung injury and renal dysfunction and acute renal failure. · The use of anti-hepatitis B IVIG sometimes produces the following adverse events: thromboembolic reactions such as myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thromboses, aseptic meningitis, hemolytic anemia or hemolysis and acute renal failure. · The use of Koate®-DVI, which we license exclusively in the U.S. to Kedrion S.p.A, a corporation organized under the laws of Italy, or Kedrion, sometimes produces the following adverse events: allergic type reactions; tingling in the arm, ear and face; blurred vision; headache; nausea; stomach ache; and jittery feeling. · The use of Prolastin® or its successor in the U.S. and Canada, Prolastin®-C, alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, or A1PI, sometimes produces the following adverse events: dyspnea, tachycardia, rash, chest pain, chills, influenza-like symptoms, hypersensitivity, hypotension and hypertension. In addition, the use of our products may be associated with serious and unexpected adverse events, or with less serious reactions at a greater than expected frequency. This may be especially true when our products are used in critically ill patient populations. When these unexpected events are reported to us, we must undertake a thorough investigation to determine causality and implications for product safety. These events must also be specifically reported to the applicable regulatory authorities. If our evaluation concludes, or regulatory authorities perceive, that there is an unreasonable risk associated with the product, we would be obligated to withdraw the impacted lot(s) of that product. Furthermore, an unexpected adverse event caused by a new product may be 11 Table of Contents recognized only after extensive use of the product, which could expose us to product liability risks, enforcement action by regulatory authorities and damage to our reputation. Once we produce a product, we rely on physicians to prescribe and administer it as we have directed and for the indications described on the labeling. It is not, however, unusual for physicians to prescribe our products for unapproved, or off-label, uses or in a manner that is inconsistent with our directions. To the extent such off-label uses and departures from our administration directions become pervasive and produce results such as reduced efficacy or other adverse effects, the reputation of our products in the marketplace may suffer. Our ability to continue manufacturing and distributing our products depends on our continued adherence to cGMP regulations at our facilities. The manufacturing processes for our products are governed by detailed written procedures and federal regulations that set forth cGMP requirements for blood and blood products. Our quality operations unit monitors compliance with these procedures and regulations, and the conformance of materials, manufacturing intermediates and final products to their specifications. Failure to adhere to established procedures or regulations, or to meet a specification, could require that a product or material be rejected and destroyed. Our adherence to cGMP regulations and the effectiveness of our quality systems are periodically assessed through inspections of our facilities by the FDA and analogous regulatory authorities of other countries. If deficiencies are noted during an inspection, we must take action to correct those deficiencies and to demonstrate to the regulatory authorities that our corrections have been effective. If serious deficiencies are noted or if we are unable to prevent recurrences, we may have to recall product or suspend operations until appropriate measures can be implemented. We are also required to report certain deviations from procedures to the FDA and even if we determine that the deviations were not material, the FDA could require us to take similar measures. Since cGMP reflects ever-evolving standards, we regularly need to update our manufacturing processes and procedures to comply with cGMP. These changes may cause us to incur costs without improving our profitability or the safety of our products. For example, more sensitive testing assays (if and when they become available) may be required or existing procedures or processes may require revalidation, all of which may be costly and time consuming and could delay or prevent the manufacturing of a product or launch of a new product. Changes in manufacturing processes, including a change in the location where the product is manufactured or a change of a third-party manufacturer, may require prior FDA review and approval or revalidation of the manufacturing processes and procedures in accordance with cGMP regulations. There may be comparable foreign requirements. For example, we finished the construction of a new plant at our facility located in Los Angeles, California in 2013, which we refer to as our Los Angeles facility, for the production of IVIG, as well as construction of a new fractionation plant at our Clayton, North Carolina plasma fractionation and manufacturing facility, which we refer to as our Clayton facility. We have begun the validation process for these plants with the appropriate regulatory authorities. We are also in the process of constructing a new, upgraded facility to assume production of the intermediate immunoassay antigen and antibody products now manufactured at our Emeryville, California plant. To validate our manufacturing processes and procedures following completion of upgraded facilities, we must demonstrate that the processes and procedures at the upgraded facilities are comparable to those currently in place at our other facilities. To provide such a comparative analysis, both the existing processes and the processes that we expect to be implemented at our upgraded facilities must comply with the regulatory standards prevailing at the time that our expected upgrade is completed. In addition, regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, continually evolve. Failure to adjust our operations to conform to new standards as established and interpreted by applicable regulatory authorities would create a compliance risk that could impair our ability to sustain normal operations. Regulatory authorities, including the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, routinely inspect our facilities to assess ongoing compliance with cGMP. If FDA, EMA or other authorities find our facilities to be out of compliance, our ongoing operations or plans to expand would be adversely affected. A significant disruption in our supply of plasma could have a material adverse effect on our business and our growth plans. The majority of our revenue depends on our access to U.S. source plasma (plasma obtained through plasmapheresis), the principal raw material for our plasma derivative products. Our ability to increase revenue depends substantially on increased access to plasma. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of source plasma, we may be unable to find an alternative cost-effective source of plasma and we would be limited in our ability to maintain current manufacturing levels of plasma derivative products. As a result, we could experience a substantial decrease in net sales or profit margins, a loss of customers, a negative effect on our reputation as a reliable supplier of plasma derivative products or a substantial delay in our production growth plans. 12 Table of Contents Our current business plan envisages an increase in the production of plasma derivative products, which depends on our ability to increase plasma collections or improve product yield. The ability to increase plasma collections may be limited, our supply of plasma could be disrupted or the cost of plasma could increase substantially, as a result of numerous factors, including: · A reduction in the donor pool. Regulators in most of the largest markets for plasma derivative products, including the U.S., restrict the use of plasma collected from specific countries and regions in the manufacture of plasma derivative products. For example, the appearance of the variant Creutzfeldt Jakob, or mad cow, disease, which resulted in the suspension of the use of plasma collected from U.K. residents and concern over the safety of blood products, which has led to increased domestic and foreign regulatory control over the collection and testing of plasma and the disqualification of certain segments of the population from the donor pool, have significantly reduced the potential donor pool. The appearance of new viral strains could further reduce the potential donor pool. Also, improvements in socioeconomic conditions in the areas where our and our suppliers collection centers are located could reduce the attractiveness of financial incentives for donors, resulting in increased donor fees or a reduction in the number of donors. · Regulatory requirements. See Disruption of the operations of our plasma collection centers would cause us to become supply constrained and our financial performance would suffer. · Plasma supply sources. In recent years, there has been vertical integration in the industry as plasma derivatives manufacturers have been acquiring plasma collection centers. Any significant disruption in the supply of plasma or an increased demand for plasma may require plasma from alternative sources, which may not be available on a timely basis. Disruption of the operations of our plasma collection centers would cause us to become supply constrained and our financial performance would suffer. In order for plasma to be used in the manufacturing of our products, the individual centers at which the plasma is collected must be licensed by the FDA and approved by the regulatory authorities, such as the EMA, of those countries in which we sell our products. When a new plasma collection center is opened and on an ongoing basis after its licensure, it must be inspected by the FDA and the EMA for compliance with cGMP and other regulatory requirements. An unsatisfactory inspection could prevent a new center from being licensed or risk the suspension or revocation of an existing license. In order for a plasma collection center to maintain its license, its operations must continue to conform to cGMP and other regulatory requirements. In the event that we determine a plasma collection center did not comply with cGMP in collecting plasma, we may be unable to use and may ultimately destroy plasma collected from that center, which would be recorded as a charge to cost of goods. Additionally, if noncompliance in the plasma collection process is identified after the impacted plasma has been pooled with compliant plasma from other sources, entire plasma pools, in-process intermediate materials and final products could be impacted. Consequently, we could experience significant inventory impairment provisions and write-offs. We plan to obtain our supplies of plasma for use in our manufacturing processes through collections at our plasma collection centers and through selective acquisitions or remodeling and relocations of existing centers. This strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully integrate new centers, to obtain FDA and other necessary approvals for the remaining unlicensed centers, to maintain a cGMP compliant environment in all centers, and to attract donors to our centers. Our ability to increase and improve the efficiency of production at our plasma collection centers may be affected by: (i) changes in the economic environment and population in selected regions where we operate plasma collection centers; (ii) the entry of competitive centers into regions where we operate; (iii) our misjudging the demographic potential of individual regions where we expect to increase production and attract new donors; (iv) unexpected facility related challenges; or (v) unexpected management challenges at select plasma collection centers. A significant portion of our net revenue has historically been derived from sales of our immunoglobulin products and we expect that they will continue to comprise a significant portion of our sales. Any adverse market event with respect to these products would have a material adverse effect on us. We have historically derived a significant portion of our net sales from our immunoglobulin products, including our IVIG products. In 2013, our IVIG products accounted for approximately 45% of our net sales. If any of these IVIG products were to lose significant sales or were substantially or completely displaced in the market, we would lose a significant and material source of our net revenue. Similarly, if either Flebogamma® or Gamunex®-C/Gamunex® were to become the subject of litigation or an adverse governmental ruling requiring us to cease sales of it, our business could be adversely affected. Although we do not currently anticipate 13 Table of Contents any significant decrease in the sales of any of these products, a significant decrease could result from plasma procurement and manufacturing issues resulting in lower product availability for sales and changing market conditions. Our products face increased competition. Our products have experienced increased competition. Each of Baxter, Biotest, CSL Behring, Kedrion and Octapharma has a 10% liquid IVIG product in the U.S. Both Octapharma and Bio Products Laboratory have launched 5% liquid IVIG products. As competition has increased, some of our competitors have discounted the price of IVIG products as many customers have become increasingly price sensitive with respect to IVIG products. If customers demand lower priced products, we may lose sales or be forced to lower our prices. Until December 2002, Talecris A1PI product, Prolastin® A1PI, was the only plasma product licensed and marketed for the therapy of congenital alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-related emphysema in the U.S. Baxter and CSL Behring received licenses for Aralast and Zemaira, respectively, which were launched in the U.S. in 2003. In addition, Kamada Ltd. received approval of its biological license application, or BLA, for its A1PI, Glassia, on July 1, 2010. While LFB Biomedicaments has a license in France for Alfalastin, we have the only licensed A1PI products with EMA Community marketing authorization. Of our competitors that are currently pursuing licensing trials in Europe, one offers a more concentrated intravenous formulation than the ones we offer in Europe. Should our competitors receive approvals in Europe sooner than expected, it will impact our unit volumes and share of sales. Our current and future competitors may increase their sales, lower their prices or change their distribution model, causing harm to our product sales and financial condition. Also, if the attrition rate of our A1PI patient base accelerates faster than we have forecast, we would have fewer patients and lower sales volume. Similarly, if a new A1PI formulation with a significantly improved rate of administration (such as aerosol inhalation) is developed, the market share of our A1PI products could be negatively impacted. Similarly, several companies are attempting to develop products which could be substitutions for A1PI, including retinoic acid, oral synthetic elastase inhibitors and gene therapy. While these products are in the early stages of development, they may eventually be successfully developed and launched. In addition, our plasma-derived products face competition from non-plasma products and other courses of treatments. For example, in 2008, GSK and Amgen launched thrombopoietin inhibitors targeting ITP patients, which may reduce the demand for IVIG to treat ITP. Other new treatments, such as small molecules, monoclonal or recombinant products, may also be developed for indications for which our products are now used. Recombinant Factor VIII and Factor IX products, which are currently available and widely used in the U.S. and Europe, compete with our own plasma-derived product in the treatment of hemophilia A and B and are perceived by many to have lower risks of disease transmission. Additional recombinant products, some with extended half-lives, could compete with our products and reduce the demand for our products. Crucell and Sanofi Pasteur have completed Phase II clinical trials for a monoclonal rabies product to compete with our rabies hyperimmune product. In February 2009, GTC Biotherapeutics obtained FDA approval of a competitive antithrombin III, or ATIII, a product derived from the milk of transgenic goats for the treatment of hereditary antithrombin deficiency. This product now directly competes with our product, Thrombate® III, which had previously been the only FDA-approved ATIII product. In addition, alternatives exist for albumin in its application as a plasma volume expander. If an increased use of alternative products for Factor VIII, Factor IX or albumin makes it uneconomical to produce our plasma-derived products, or if further technological advances improve these products or create other competitive alternatives to our plasma derivative products, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We do not currently sell any recombinant products. We are developing recombinant versions of A1PI and plasmin, but we cannot be certain that any of these products will ever be approved or commercialized. As a result, our product offerings may remain plasma-derived, even if our competitors offer competing recombinant products. The introduction of products approved for alternative routes of administration, including the subcutaneous route of administration, may also adversely affect sales of our products. For example, in 2010, Biotest introduced a subcutaneous anti-hepatitis preparation and is registering the product in European countries in which we market our anti-hepatitis B IVIG, which could negatively impact our sales. Beginning in the late 1980s, Talecris (and prior to 2005, Bayer HealthCare LLC, or Bayer) was the supplier of record for the Canadian blood system. Talecris was awarded five-year contracts with Canadian Blood Services and Héma-Québec, which jointly operated the Canadian blood system, in December 2007 that became effective April 2008 and terminated in March 2013. Canadian Blood Services and Héma-Québec ended their partnership in 2012 and now negotiate separately with suppliers. Operating separately, Canadian Blood Services comprises approximately 70% and Héma-Québec comprises approximately 30% of the Canadian market for 14 Table of Contents plasma products and fractionation services. In 2013, Canadian Blood Services selected us as its primary supplier of both IVIG and fractionation services pursuant to a five-year contract that became effective in April 2013. Héma-Québec negotiated a reduced four-year contract with us that also became effective in April 2013, under which we supply a reduced portion of Héma-Québecs plasma-derived products and no longer provide fractionation services. Under these new contracts, we maintained our position as the primary immunoglobulin supplier to Canada. We face competition from companies with greater financial resources. We operate in highly competitive markets. Our principal competitors include Baxter, CSL Behring and Octapharma. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than us. As a result, they may be able to devote more funds to research and development and new production technologies, as well as to the promotion of their products and business. These competitors may also be able to sustain for longer periods a deliberate substantial reduction in the price of their products or services. The development by a competitor of a similar or superior product or increased pricing competition may result in a reduction in our net sales or a decrease in our profit margins. Technological changes in the production of plasma derivative products could render our production process uneconomical. Technological advances have accelerated changes in many bioscience industries in recent years. Future technological developments could render our production processes for plasma derivative products uneconomical and may require us to invest substantial amounts of capital to upgrade our facilities. Such investments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to fund such investment from existing funds or raise sufficient capital to make such investments. The discovery of new pathogens could slow our growth and adversely affect profit margins. The possible appearance of new pathogens could trigger the need for changes in our existing inactivation and production methods, including the administration of new detection tests. Such a development could result in delays in production until the new methods are in place, as well as increased costs that may not be readily passed on to our customers. Product liability claims or product recalls involving our products or products we distribute could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of plasma-derived therapeutic protein products. We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and an even greater risk when we commercially sell any products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: · decreased demand for our products and any product candidates that we may develop; · injury to our reputation; · withdrawal of clinical trial participants; · costs to defend the related litigation; · substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients; · loss of revenue; and · the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop. Like many plasma fractionators, we have been, and may in the future be, involved in product liability or related claims relating to our products, including claims alleging the transmission of disease through the use of such products. Plasma is a biological matter that is capable of transmitting viruses and pathogens, whether known or unknown. Therefore, our plasma and plasma derivative products, if donors are not properly screened or the plasma not properly collected, tested, inactivated, processed, stored and transported, could cause serious disease and possibly death to the patient. See also Our ability to continue to produce safe and effective products depends on a plasma supply free of transmittable diseases. Any transmission of disease through the use of one of our products or third-party products sold by us could result in claims by persons allegedly infected by such products. 15 Table of Contents Our potential product liability also extends to our Diagnostic and Hospital division products. In addition, we sell and distribute third-party products, and the laws of the jurisdictions where we sell or distribute such products could also expose us to product liability claims for those products. Furthermore, the presence of a defect in a product could require us to carry out a recall of such product. A product liability claim or a product recall could result in substantial financial losses, negative reputational repercussions and an inability to retain customers. Although we have a program of insurance policies designed to protect us and our subsidiaries from product liability claims, and we self-insure a portion of this risk, claims made against our insurance policies could exceed our limits of coverage. We intend to expand our insurance coverage as our sales grow. However, as product liability insurance is expensive and can be difficult to obtain, a product liability claim could decrease our access to product liability insurance on acceptable terms. In turn, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost and may not be able to obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. Our ability to continue to produce safe and effective products depends on a plasma supply free of transmittable diseases. Despite overlapping safeguards, including the screening of donors and other steps to remove or inactivate viruses and other infectious disease-causing agents, the risk of transmissible disease through plasma-derived products cannot be entirely eliminated. If a new infectious disease was to emerge in the human population, the regulatory and public health authorities could impose precautions to limit the transmission of the disease that would impair our ability to procure plasma, manufacture our products or both. Such precautionary measures could be taken before there is conclusive medical or scientific evidence that a disease poses a risk for plasma-derived products. In recent years, new testing and viral inactivation methods have been developed that more effectively detect and inactivate infectious viruses in collected plasma. There can be no assurance, however, that such new testing and inactivation methods will adequately screen for, and inactivate, infectious agents in the plasma used in the production of our products. Plasma and plasma derivative products are fragile, and improper handling of our plasma or plasma derivative products could adversely affect results of operations. Plasma is a raw material that is susceptible to damage. Almost immediately after its collection from a donor, plasma is stored and transported at temperatures that are at least -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit). Once we manufacture plasma derivative products, they must be handled carefully and kept at appropriate temperatures. Our failure, or the failure of third parties that supply, ship or distribute our plasma and plasma derivative products, to properly care for our plasma or plasma derivative products may require us to destroy some raw materials or products. If the volume of plasma or plasma derivative products damaged by such failures were to be significant, the loss of that plasma or those plasma derivative products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Past due receivables may negatively affect our working capital levels and increase financial costs. Our receivables had an aging average of 52, 52 and 65 days at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The higher receivables aging average that we experienced in prior years was primarily due to a higher proportion of sales in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. Sales to these countries accounted for approximately 11% of total net revenue in 2013. It is common to experience extended collection periods for balances due in these countries. In particular, in Spain, Italy and Portugal, it is common practice for government or local authority-backed entities to pay suppliers well after the 30- to 60-day period normally applied, with payments occurring very often after one year. We cannot assure you that our average receivables aging levels will not increase if sales to these markets increase. Failure to receive timely payments for the sale of our products negatively affects our working capital levels and may require us to obtain more short-term financing than would otherwise be needed. Our future success depends on our ability to retain members of our senior management and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are highly dependent on the principal members of our executive and scientific teams. The loss of the services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of our research, development, operational and commercialization objectives. In particular, we believe the loss of the services of any of Víctor Grifols Roura, Ramón Riera Roca, Alfredo Arroyo Guerra, Carlos Roura Fernández, Vicente Blanquer Torre, Eva Bastida Tubau, Mateo Florencio Borrás Humbert, Antonio Viñes Páres, Montserrat Lloveras Calvo, David Ian Bell, Gregory Gene Rich, Shinji Wada, Alberto Grifols Roura, Francisco Javier Jorba Ribes, Nuria Pascual Lapeña or Joel Abelson would significantly and negatively impact our business. We do not maintain key person insurance on any of our senior management. 16 Table of Contents Recruiting and retaining qualified operations, finance and accounting, scientific, clinical and sales and marketing personnel will be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms, given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified and experienced personnel, we could lose customers and suffer reduced profitability. Even if we are successful in attracting and retaining such personnel, competition for such employees may significantly increase our compensation costs and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Federal cGMP regulations also require that the personnel we employ and hold responsible for the collection, processing, testing, storage or distribution of blood or blood components be adequate in number, educational background, training (including professional training as necessary) and experience, or a combination thereof, and have capabilities commensurate with their assigned functions, a thorough understanding of the procedures or control operations they perform, the necessary training or experience and adequate information concerning the application of relevant cGMP requirements to their individual responsibilities. Our failure to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel may result in a regulatory violation, affect product quality, require the recall or market withdrawal of affected product or result in a suspension or termination of our license to market our products, or any combination thereof. Our business requires substantial capital to operate and grow and to achieve our strategy of realizing increased operating leverage, including the completion of several large capital projects. We have implemented several large capital projects to expand and improve our Los Angeles and Clayton facilities and our manufacturing plant located in Parets del Vallès, near Barcelona, Spain, or the Parets facility, and to improve the structure of our plasma collection centers in the United States. These projects may run over budget or be delayed. We cannot be certain that these projects will be completed in a timely manner or that we will maintain our compliance with cGMP regulations, and we may need to spend additional amounts to achieve compliance. Additionally, by the time these multi-year projects are completed, market conditions may differ significantly from our assumptions regarding the number of competitors, customer demand, alternative therapies, reimbursement and public policy, and as a result, capital returns might not be realized. We also plan on spending substantial sums on research and development, to obtain the approval of the FDA, and other regulatory agencies, for new indications for existing products, to develop new product delivery mechanisms for existing products and to develop innovative product additions. We face a number of obstacles to successfully converting these efforts into profitable products, including, but not limited to, the successful development of an experimental product for use in clinical trials, the design of clinical study protocols acceptable to the FDA and other regulatory agencies, the successful outcome of clinical trials, our ability to scale our manufacturing processes to produce commercial quantities or successfully transition technology, the approval of the FDA and other regulatory agencies of our products and our ability to successfully market an approved product or new indication. For example, when a new product is approved, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or other regulatory authorities may require post-approval clinical trials, sometimes called Phase IV clinical trials. If the results of such trials are unfavorable, this could result in the loss of the license to market the product, with a resulting loss of sales. We are expecting significant capital spending as we are undertaking an investment plan that involves cumulative capital expenditures of approximately 450 million from 2014 through 2016. The amount and timing of future capital spending is dependent upon a number of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and the extent and timing of particular projects, among other things. Our ability to grow our business is dependent upon the timely completion of these projects and obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals. We may not be able to develop some of our international operations successfully. We currently conduct sales in approximately 100 countries. The successful operation of such geographically dispersed resources requires considerable management and financial resources. In particular, we must bridge our business culture to the business culture of each country in which we operate. In addition, international operations and the provision of services in foreign markets are subject to additional risks, such as changing market conditions, currency exchange rate fluctuations, trade barriers, exchange controls, regulatory changes, changes to tax regimes, foreign investment limitations, civil disturbances and war. Furthermore, if an area in which we have significant operations or an area into which we are looking to expand suffers an economic recession or currency devaluation, our net sales and accounts receivable collections in that region will likely decline substantially or we may not be able to successfully expand or operate in that region. 17 Table of Contents We are susceptible to interest rate variations. We use issuances of debt and bank borrowings as a source of funding. At December 31, 2013, pro forma for the Novartis Acquisition, the offering of the Notes and the entry into the New Credit Facilities, $3.95 billion and 400 million, which represented 82%, of our senior interest bearing debt, bore interest at variable rates, at a spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, for our U.S. dollar denominated debt and at a spread over EURIBOR for our euro denominated debt. At December 31, 2013, we had entered into variable to fixed interest rate swaps for 26% of our U.S. dollar denominated pro forma debt and 27% of our euro denominated pro forma debt. However, there can be no assurance that such instruments will be successful at reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations. Any increase in interest rates payable by us, which could be adversely affected by, among other things, our inability to meet certain financial ratios, would increase our interest expense and reduce our cash flow, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. See Item 11 of this Part I, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Interest Rate Risk. Our results of operations and financial condition may be affected by adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially a significant shift in the value of the euro as compared to the U.S. dollar. A significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than our reporting currency, the euro. In 2013, $2.66 billion (1.97 billion), or 72%, of our net revenue of $3.7 billion (2.7 billion) were denominated in U.S. dollars. We are also exposed to currency fluctuations with respect to other currencies, such as the British pound, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar and the Argentine, Mexican and Chilean pesos. Currency fluctuations among the euro, the U.S. dollar and the other currencies in which we do business result in foreign currency translation gains or losses which could be significant. We are also exposed to risk based on the payment of U.S. dollar denominated indebtedness. At December 31, 2013, our U.S. dollar denominated senior debt totaled $3.2 billion and pro forma for the Novartis Acquisition, the offering of the Notes and the entry into the New Credit Facilities, we would have approximately $4.95 billion of U.S. dollar denominated senior debt. See Item 11 of this Part I, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Currency Risk. If the Clayton, Los Angeles or Parets facilities were to suffer a crippling accident, or if a force majeure event materially affected our ability to operate and produce saleable products, a substantial part of our manufacturing capacity could be shut down for an extended period. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from plasma fractionation and products manufactured at our Clayton, Los Angeles facilities and Parets facilities. In addition, a substantial portion of our plasma supply is stored at facilities in City of Industry, California and Benson, North Carolina, as well as at our Clayton and Parets facilities. If any of these facilities were to be impacted by an accident or a force majeure event such as an earthquake, major fire or explosion, major equipment failure or power failure lasting beyond the capabilities of our backup generators, our revenue would be materially adversely affected. In this situation, our manufacturing capacity could be shut down for an extended period and we could experience a loss of raw materials, work in process or finished goods inventory. Other force majeure events such as terrorist acts, influenza pandemic or similar events could also impede our ability to operate our business. In addition, in any such event, the reconstruction of our Clayton, Los Angeles or Parets facilities or our plasma storage facilities, the regulatory approval of the new facilities, and the replenishment of raw material plasma could be time consuming. During this period, we would be unable to manufacture all of our products at other plants due to the need for FDA and foreign regulatory authority inspection and certification of such facilities and processes. Our property damage and business interruption insurance may be insufficient to mitigate the losses from any such accident or force majeure event. We may also be unable to recover the value of the lost plasma or work in process inventories, as well as the sales opportunities from the products we would be unable to produce. If we experience equipment difficulties or if the suppliers of our equipment or disposable goods fail to deliver key product components or supplies in a timely manner, our manufacturing ability would be impaired and our product sales could suffer. We depend on a limited number of companies that supply and maintain our equipment and provide supplies such as chromatography resins, filter media, glass and stoppers used in the manufacture of our products. If our equipment should malfunction, the repair or replacement of the machinery may require substantial time and cost, which could disrupt our production and other operations. Our plasma collection centers rely on disposable goods supplied by third parties and information technology systems hosted by third parties. Our plasma collection centers cannot operate without an uninterrupted supply of these disposable goods and the operation of these systems. Alternative sources for key component parts or disposable goods may not be immediately available. And while we have experienced periodic outages of these systems, a material outage would affect our ability to operate our collection centers. Any new equipment or change in supplied materials may require revalidation by us or review and approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA, which may be time consuming and require additional capital and other resources. We may not be able to find an adequate alternative supplier in a reasonable time period, or on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. 18 Table of Contents As a result, shipments of affected products may be limited or delayed. Our inability to obtain our key source supplies for the manufacture of products may require us to delay shipments of products, harm customer relationships and force us to curtail operations. If our shipping or distribution channels were to become inaccessible due to a crippling accident, an act of terrorism, a strike or any other force majeure event, our supply, production and distribution processes could be disrupted. Not all shipping or distribution channels are equipped to transport plasma. If any of our shipping or distribution channels becomes inaccessible due to a crippling accident, an act of terrorism, a strike or any other force majeure event, we may experience disruptions in our continued supply of plasma and other raw materials, delays in our production process or a reduction in our ability to distribute our products directly to our customers. We rely in large part on third parties for the sale, distribution and delivery of our products. In the United States, we regularly enter into distribution, supply and fulfillment contracts with group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, home care companies, alternate infusion sites, hospital groups and others. We are highly dependent on these contracts for the successful sale, distribution and delivery of our products. For example, we rely principally on GPOs and on our distributors to sell our IVIG products. If such parties breach, terminate or otherwise fail to perform under the agreements, our ability to effectively distribute our products will be impaired and our business may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, through circumstances outside of our control, such as general economic decline, market saturation or increased competition, we may be unable to successfully renegotiate our contracts or secure terms which are as favorable to us. Furthermore, we rely in certain countries on distributors for sales of our products. Disagreements or difficulties with our distributors supporting our export business could result in a loss of sales. We may not be able to commercialize products in development. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates or for the marketing of existing products for new indicated uses, we must conduct, at our own expense, extensive preclinical tests to demonstrate the safety of our product candidates in animals and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Preclinical and clinical testing is expensive, is difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical testing and the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including, without limitation: · regulators or institutional review boards, or IRBs, may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial within a country or at a prospective trial site, respectively; · the regulatory requirements for product approval may not be explicit, may evolve over time and may diverge by jurisdiction; · our preclinical tests or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical trials or to abandon projects that we had expected to be promising; · the number of patients required for our clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in our clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may withdraw from our clinical trials at higher rates than we anticipate, any of which would result in significant delays; · our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner; · we may be forced to suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or if any participant experiences an unexpected serious adverse event; · regulators or IRBs may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements; · undetected or concealed fraudulent activity by a clinical researcher, if discovered, could preclude the submission of clinical data prepared by that researcher, lead to the suspension or substantive scientific review of one or more of 19 Table of Contents our marketing applications by regulatory agencies, and result in the recall of any approved product distributed pursuant to data determined to be fraudulent; · the cost of our clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate; · the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate because currently we do not have any agreements with third-party manufacturers for the long-term commercial supply of any of our product candidates; · an audit of preclinical or clinical studies by the FDA or other regulatory authorities may reveal noncompliance with applicable regulations, which could lead to disqualification of the results and the need to perform additional studies; and · the effects of our product candidates may not achieve the desired clinical benefits or may cause undesirable side effects, or the product candidates may have other unexpected characteristics. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive, or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may be delayed in or unable to obtaining marketing approval or reimbursement for our product candidates, be able to obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended, or have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval. Our product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals. We do not know whether any preclinical tests or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten the patent protection period during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, impairing our ability to commercialize our products or product candidates. Even if preclinical trials are successful, we still may be unable to commercialize a product due to difficulties in obtaining regulatory approval for its engineering process or problems in scaling that process to commercial production. Additionally, if produced, a product may not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community to be profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: · the prevalence and severity of any side effects; · the efficacy and potential advantages over alternative treatments; · the ability to offer our product candidates for sale at competitive prices; · relative convenience and ease of administration; · the willingness of physicians to prescribe new therapies and of the target patient population to try such therapies; · the strength of marketing and distribution support; and · sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that any products we may seek to develop will ever be successfully commercialized, and to the extent they are not successfully commercialized, such products could involve significant expense with no corresponding revenue. A breakdown in our information technology systems could result in a significant disruption to our business. Our operations are highly dependent on our information technology systems, including internet-based systems, which may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack. In addition, our systems are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches, whether by employees or others, which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public exposure of personal information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, customers, plasma donors and others. If we were to suffer a 20 Table of Contents breakdown in our systems, storage, distribution or tracing, we could experience significant disruptions affecting our manufacturing, accounting and billing processes. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the U.S. and other countries of the intellectual property relating to or incorporated into our technology and products. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the U.S. and other countries for the intellectual property covering or incorporated into our technology and products, especially intellectual property related to our purification processes. The patent situation in the field of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and scientific questions. We may not be able to obtain additional issued patents relating to our technology or products. Even if patents are issued to us or to our licensors, they may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, held to be unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of time our products have patent protection. Additionally, most of our patents relate to the processes we use to produce our products, not to the products themselves. In many cases, the plasma-derived products we produce or develop in the future will not, in and of themselves, be patentable. Since our patents relate to processes, if a competitor is able to design and utilize a process that does not rely on our protected intellectual property, that competitor could sell a plasma-derived or other product similar to one we developed or sell. Our patents also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology. Because patent applications in the U.S. and many other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after their filing, if at all, and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, neither we nor our licensors can be certain that we or they were the first to make the inventions claimed in our or their issued patents or pending patent applications, or that we or they were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in such patent applications. If a third party has also filed a U.S. patent application covering our product candidates or a similar invention, we may be required to participate in an adversarial proceeding, known as an interference proceeding, declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention in the U.S. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial and our efforts in them could be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our anticipated U.S. patent position. Our patents expire at various dates. Our pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will provide us with any competitive advantage. Even if issued, we cannot guarantee that: any of our present or future patents or patent claims or other intellectual property rights will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or abandoned; our intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages; our ability to assert our intellectual property rights against potential competitors or to settle current or future disputes will not be limited by our agreements with third parties; any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought; our intellectual property rights will be enforced in jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal protection may be weak; or we will not lose the ability to assert our intellectual property rights against, or to license our technology to, others and collect royalties or other payments. In addition, our competitors or others may design around our protected patents or technologies. Effective protection of our intellectual property rights may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in some countries. Changes in patent laws or their interpretation in the U.S. and other countries could also diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In addition, the legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. In order to preserve and enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights, we may need to make claims or file lawsuits against third parties. Such lawsuits could entail significant costs to us and divert our managements attention from developing and commercializing our products. We, like other companies in the pharmaceutical industry, may become aware of counterfeit versions of our products becoming available domestically and abroad. Counterfeit products may use different and possibly contaminated sources of plasma and other raw materials, and the purification process involved in the manufacture of counterfeit products may raise additional safety concerns, over which we have no control. Any reported adverse events involving counterfeit products that purport to be our products could harm our reputation and the sale of our products in particular and consumer willingness to use plasma-derived therapeutics in general. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property may have occurred or may occur in the future. Although we have taken steps to minimize this risk, any failure to identify unauthorized use and otherwise adequately protect our intellectual property would adversely affect our business. For example, any unauthorized use of our trademarks could harm our reputation or commercial interests. Moreover, if we are required to commence litigation related to unauthorized use, whether as a plaintiff or defendant, such litigation would be time consuming, force us to incur significant costs and divert our attention and the efforts of our management and other employees, which could, in turn, result in lower revenue and higher expenses. 21 Table of Contents In addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and know-how. We generally seek to protect proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information, may be limited as to their term and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors or other third parties. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to determine and enforce the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. We also rely on contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, distributors, employees and consultants and implement security measures designed to protect our trade secrets. We cannot assure you that these contractual protections and security measures will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our suppliers, employees or consultants will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of such contracts. Since we rely on trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, in addition to patents, to protect some of our intellectual property, there is a risk that third parties may obtain and improperly utilize our proprietary information to our competitive disadvantage. We may not be able to detect the unauthorized use of such information, prevent such use or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. We may infringe or be alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties. Our products or product candidates may infringe or be accused of infringing one or more claims of an issued patent or may fall within the scope of one or more claims in a published patent application that may be subsequently issued and to which we do not hold a license or other rights. Third parties may own or control these patents or patent applications in the U.S. and abroad. These third parties could bring claims against us or our collaborators that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or they could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit. If we are found to be infringing on the patent rights of a third party, or in order to avoid potential claims, we or our collaborators may choose or be required to seek a license from a third party and be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we or our collaborators are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings, including interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. Many of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We take steps to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us. We may, however, be subject to claims that we or these employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, trade secrets or other proprietary information of any such employees former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims and, even if we are successful in defending ourselves, could result in substantial costs to us or be distracting to our management. If we fail to defend any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. We have in-licensed certain patent rights. Our in-license agreements for certain patent rights may impose payment and/or other material obligations on us as a licensee. Although we are currently in compliance with all of our material obligations under these licenses, if we were to breach any such 22 Table of Contents obligations, our counterparty licensors may be entitled to terminate the licenses. Such termination may restrict, delay or eliminate our ability to develop and commercialize our products, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot guarantee that the third-party patents and technology we license will not be licensed to our competitors. In the future, we may need to obtain additional licenses, renew existing license agreements or otherwise replace existing technology. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed or the technology can be replaced on acceptable terms, or at all. Risks Relating to the Healthcare Industry The implementation of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law in the U.S. may adversely affect our business. Through the March 2010 adoption of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the companion Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act in the U.S., or collectively, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law, substantial changes are being made to the current system for paying for healthcare in the U.S., including programs to extend medical benefits to millions of individuals who currently lack insurance coverage. The changes contemplated by the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law are subject to rule-making and implementation timelines that extend for several years, and this uncertainty limits our ability to forecast changes that may occur in the future. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld as constitutional a key provision in the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law, often referred to as the individual mandate, which will require most individuals to have health insurance in 2014, or pay a penalty. However, the decision also invalidated a provision in the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law requiring states, in 2014, to expand their Medicaid programs or risk the complete loss of all federal Medicaid funding. The Court held that the federal government may offer states the option of accepting the expansion requirement, but that it may not take away pre-existing Medicaid funds in order to coerce states into complying with the expansion. Almost half the states have not yet accepted the Medicaid expansion, so the full extent of increased health care coverage under the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law is uncertain. Adding to this uncertainty, in responding to difficulties encountered in implementing 2010 Healthcare Reform, the White House and federal agencies have instituted various temporary implementation delays, such as regarding the employer mandate that generally requires employers with 50 or more full time employees to provide certain health insurance to those employees or pay specified fines. Implementation of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law has already begun with respect to certain significant cost-saving measures with respect to, for example, several government healthcare programs that cover the cost of our products, including Medicaid, Medicare Parts B and D and the 340B/Public Health Service, or PHS, program, and these efforts could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance. For example, with respect to Medicaid, in order for a drug manufacturers products to be reimbursed by federal funding under Medicaid, the manufacturer must enter into a Medicaid drug rebate agreement with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and pay certain rebates to the states based on utilization data provided by each state to the manufacturer and to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, and pricing data provided by the manufacturer to the federal government. The states share this savings with the federal government and sometimes implement their own additional supplemental rebate programs. Under the Medicaid drug rebate program, the rebate amount for most brand name drugs was previously equal to a minimum of 15.1% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP, or AMP less Best Price, or AMP less BP, whichever is greater. Effective January 1, 2010, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law generally increased the size of the Medicaid rebates paid by drug manufacturers for single source and innovator multiple source (brand name) drugs from a minimum of 15.1% to a minimum of 23.1% of the AMP, subject to certain exceptions (for example, for certain clotting factors, such as our Factor VIII and Factor IX products, the increase was limited to a minimum of 17.1% of the AMP). For non-innovator multiple source (generic) drugs, the rebate percentage was increased from a minimum of 11.0% to a minimum of 13.0% of AMP. In 2010, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law also newly extended this rebate obligation to prescription drugs covered by Medicaid managed care organizations. In addition, the statutory definition of AMP changed in 2010 as a result of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law. In November 2010, CMS withdrew previously issued regulations defining AMP and in February 2012 issued proposed regulations that are not yet finalized, and CMS recently announced that a final rule will be issued in May 2014. We believe we are making reasonable assumptions regarding our reporting obligations with respect to this new definition, but, in the absence of final regulations from CMS, the adequacy of our assumptions is not certain. Once CMS issues final regulations, we may determine that our assumptions require amendment to comply with the regulatory definition of AMP. The 2010 Healthcare Reform Law also created new rebate obligations for our products under Medicare Part D, a partial, voluntary prescription drug benefit created by the U.S. federal government primarily for persons 65 years old and over. The Part D drug program is administered through private insurers that contract with CMS. Beginning in 2011, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law generally required that we provide a 50% discount to patients who fall within the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also referred to as the donut hole, which is a gap in Medicare Part D coverage for beneficiaries who have expended certain amounts for drugs. 23 Table of Contents The availability of federal funds to pay for our products under Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs requires that we extend discounts under the 340B/PHS program, and changes to this program under the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law could adversely affect our financial performance. The 340B/PHS program extends discounts to a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of certain low income individuals, and the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law expanded the number of qualified 340B entities eligible to purchase products for outpatient use, adding certain cancer centers, childrens hospitals, critical access hospitals and rural referral centers. The PHS price, or ceiling price, cannot exceed the AMP (as reported to CMS under the Medicaid drug rebate program) less the Medicaid unit rebate amount. We have entered into a pharmaceutical pricing agreement, or PPA, with the government in which we have agreed to participate in the 340B/PHS program by charging eligible entities no more than the PHS ceiling price for drugs intended for outpatient use. The 2010 Healthcare Reform Law also introduced a biosimilar pathway that permits companies to obtain FDA approval of versions of existing biologics that are highly similar to innovative biologics based upon reduced documentation and data requirements deemed sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy than are required for the pioneer biologics. The new law provides that a biosimilar application may be submitted as soon as four years after the reference product is first licensed, and that the FDA may not make approval of an application effective until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed. Although drug manufacturers have begun efforts to develop biosimilar drugs for the U.S. market, none have yet been approved by the FDA. However, an approval pathway for biosimilar versions of our biological products now exists in the United States for the first time, and accordingly we expect in the future to face greater competition from biosimilar products, including a possible increase in patent challenges, all of which could adversely affect our financial performance. The FDA is actively implementing the biosimilar pathway, including through the issuance of draft guidance documents, and has indicated that final guidance documents may be issued in 2014. Regarding access to our products, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law established and provided significant funding for a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to coordinate and fund Comparative Effectiveness Research, as those terms are defined in the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law. While the stated intent of Comparative Effectiveness Research is to develop information to guide providers to the most efficacious therapies, outcomes of Comparative Effectiveness Research could influence the reimbursement or coverage for therapies that are determined to be less cost effective than others. Should any of our products be determined to be less cost effective than alternative therapies, the levels of reimbursement for these products, or the willingness to reimburse at all, could be impacted, which could materially impact our financial results. A provision of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain U.S. healthcare practitioners, such as physicians and academic medical centers, and with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in reporting entities. On February 1, 2013, a final rule was issued to implement the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. Under this rule, data collection activities began on August 1, 2013, and first disclosure reports were due by March 31, 2014 for the period August 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013. As required under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, information from these reports will be published on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and the physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities, which is expected to be available to the public by September 30, 2014. It is difficult to predict how the new requirements, which also preempt similar state law reporting requirements, may impact existing relationships among manufacturers, physicians and teaching hospitals. We could be adversely affected if other government or private third-party payors decrease or otherwise limit the amount, price, scope or other eligibility requirements for reimbursement for the purchasers of our products. Prices in many countries, including many European countries, are subject to local regulation and certain pharmaceutical products, such as plasma derivative products, are subject to price controls in several of our principal markets, including Spain and countries within the European Union. In the U.S., where pricing levels for our products are substantially established by third-party payors, if payors reduce the amount of reimbursement for a product, it may cause groups or individuals dispensing the product to discontinue administration of the product, to administer lower doses, to substitute lower cost products or to seek additional price-related concessions. These actions could have a negative effect on our financial results, particularly in cases where our products command a premium price in the marketplace or where changes in reimbursement induce a shift in the location of treatment. The existence of direct and indirect price controls and pressures over our products has affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our ability to maintain or increase gross margins. In the U.S., for example, beginning in 2005, the Medicare drug reimbursement methodology for physician and hospital outpatient payment schedules changed to Average Sales Price, or ASP, + 6%. This payment was based on a volume-weighted average of all brands under a common billing code. Medicare payments to physicians between the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 dropped 14% for both the powder and liquid forms of IVIG. Medicare payments to hospitals fell 45% for powder IVIG and 30% for liquid IVIG between the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006. The Medicare reimbursement changes resulted 24 Table of Contents in the shift of a significant number of Medicare IVIG patients to hospitals from physicians offices beginning in 2005, as many physicians could no longer recover their costs of obtaining and administering IVIG in their offices and clinics. After 2006, some hospitals reportedly began to refuse to provide IVIG to Medicare patients due to reimbursement rates that were below their acquisition costs. Subsequent changes have improved some of these Medicare reimbursement issues, although there has been variability in the reimbursement levels for separately payable, non-pass-through drugs and biologicals in the hospital outpatient setting over the past few years, making financial performance predictions difficult. On January 1, 2008, the CMS reduced the reimbursement for these separately covered drugs and biologicals, including IVIG, in the hospital outpatient setting from ASP + 6% to ASP + 5%, using 2006 Medicare claims data as a reference for this reduction. In addition, CMS reduced a hospital add on payment from $75 to $38 per infusion. Beginning January 1, 2009, CMS further reduced the hospital outpatient reimbursement for separately covered outpatient drugs, including IVIG, to ASP + 4%, and eliminated the add on payment. For 2010, the rate remained as ASP + 4%, based on a cost-based methodology that also involved reallocating certain overhead costs from packaged drugs to unpackaged drugs. CMS increased the rate to ASP + 6% for 2013, and maintained the same rate for 2014. In addition, under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, Medicare is subject to a 2% reduction in federal spending, or sequestration, including drugs reimbursed under Medicare, for federal fiscal years 2013 through 2023. The full ramifications of this sequestration for Medicare reimbursement are not yet clear, as Congressional action may reduce, eliminate or otherwise change this payment reduction. Also, the intended use of a drug product by a physician can affect pricing. Physicians frequently prescribe legally available therapies for uses that are not described in the products labeling and that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities in other countries. These off-label uses are common across medical specialties, and physicians may believe such off-label uses constitute the preferred treatment or treatment of last resort for many patients in varied circumstances. Industry data indicates that a significant portion of IVIG volume may be used to fill physician prescriptions for indications not approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities. If reimbursement for off-label uses of products, including IVIG, is reduced or eliminated by Medicare or other third-party payors, including those in the U.S. or the European Union, we could be adversely affected. For example, CMS could initiate an administrative procedure known as a National Coverage Determination, or NCD, by which the agency determines which uses of a therapeutic product would be reimbursable under Medicare and which uses would not. This determination process can be lengthy, thereby creating a long period during which the future reimbursement for a particular product may be uncertain. High levels of spending on IVIG products, along with increases in IVIG prices, increased IVIG utilization and the high proportion of off-label uses, may increase the risk of regulation of IVIG reimbursement by CMS. On the state level, similar limits could be proposed for therapeutic products covered under Medicaid. Certain of our business practices are subject to scrutiny by regulatory authorities, as well as to lawsuits brought by private citizens under federal and state laws. Failure to comply with applicable law or an adverse decision in lawsuits may result in adverse consequences to us. The laws governing our conduct in the U.S. are enforceable by criminal, civil and administrative penalties. Violations of laws such as the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Federal False Claims Act, or the FCA, the PHS Act or a provision of the U.S. Social Security Act known as the Anti-Kickback Law, or any regulations promulgated under their authority, may result in jail sentences, fines or exclusion from federal and state programs, as may be determined by Medicare, Medicaid, the Department of Defense, other regulatory authorities and the courts. There can be no assurance that our activities will not come under the scrutiny of regulators and other government authorities or that our practices will not be found to violate applicable laws, rules and regulations or prompt lawsuits by private citizen relators under federal or state false claims laws. For example, under the Anti-Kickback Law, and similar state laws and regulations, even common business arrangements, such as discounted terms and volume incentives for customers in a position to recommend or choose drugs and devices for patients, such as physicians and hospitals, can result in substantial legal penalties, including, among others, exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs, and arrangements with referral sources must be structured with care to comply with applicable requirements. Also, certain business practices, such as payment of consulting fees to healthcare providers, sponsorship of educational or research grants, charitable donations, interactions with healthcare providers that prescribe products for uses not approved by the FDA and financial support for continuing medical education programs, must be conducted within narrowly prescribed and controlled limits to avoid any possibility of wrongfully influencing healthcare providers to prescribe or purchase particular products or as a reward for past prescribing. Significant enforcement activity has been the result of actions brought by relators, who file complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state False Claims Act statutes and can be entitled to receive up to 30% of total recoveries. Also, violations of the False Claims Act can result in treble damages, and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to $11,000 per claim. Additional and stricter prohibitions could be implemented by federal and state authorities. Where practices have been found to involve improper incentives to use products, government investigations and assessments of penalties against manufacturers have resulted in substantial damages and fines. Many manufacturers have been required to enter into consent decrees or orders that prescribe allowable corporate conduct. 25 Table of Contents Failure to satisfy requirements under the FDCA can also result in penalties, as well as requirements to enter into consent decrees or orders that prescribe allowable corporate conduct. In this regard, our Los Angeles facility was previously managed pursuant to a consent decree that was entered into in February 1998 based on action by the FDA and DOJ addressing FDCA violations committed by the former owner of the facility, Alpha Therapeutic Corporation, or Alpha. The consent decree provided for annual inspection of the plant by the FDA. On March 15, 2012, the United States District Court for the Central District of California entered an order vacating the consent decree on the Los Angeles facility. Adverse consequences can also result from failure to comply with the requirements of the 340B/PHS program under the PHS Act, which extends discounts to a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS. For example, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law requires the Secretary of HHS to develop and issue regulations for the 340B/PHS program establishing standards for the imposition of sanctions in the form of civil monetary penalties, or CMP, for manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge a covered entity for a 340B drug. The CMP can be up to $5,000 for each instance of overcharging a covered entity. HHS has never had CMP authority that addresses this area and has not yet issued final regulations to implement this new penalty provision, and accordingly, the impact of this CMP provision is uncertain. In September 2010, HHS Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in which it is considering imposing CMPs on manufacturers in certain cases where a covered entity has been unable to find a given product at a 340B price and has instead purchased the drug outside of the 340B Program at a price greater than the ceiling price. Certain of our products are subject to shortages and allocation issues can arise. Accordingly, if the HRSA adopts a CMP interpretation of this kind, it could potentially have adverse consequences on our financial performance. In addition, companies in the U.S., Canada and the European Union are generally restricted from promoting approved products for other indications that are not specifically approved by the competent regulatory authorities (e.g., the FDA in the U.S.), nor can companies promote unapproved products. In the U.S., pharmaceutical companies have, to a limited extent, been recognized by the FDA as permitted to disseminate to physicians certain truthful and accurate information regarding unapproved uses of approved products, or results of studies involving investigational products. In addition, in December 2012, a federal appeals court in New York found that the criminal prosecution of a pharmaceutical manufacturer for truthful, non-misleading speech promoting the lawful, off-label use of an FDA-approved drug would violate the manufacturers constitutional rights of free speech, and the FDA chose not to appeal that decision. Improper promotion of unapproved drugs or devices or unapproved indications for a drug or device may subject us to warnings from, or enforcement action by, regulatory agencies, harm demand for our products, and subject us to civil and criminal sanctions. Further, sanctions under the FCA have recently been brought against companies accused of promoting off-label uses of drugs, because such promotion induces the use and subsequent claims for reimbursement under Medicare and other federal programs. Similar actions for off-label promotion have been initiated by several states for Medicaid fraud. The 2010 Healthcare Reform Law significantly strengthened provisions of the FCA, Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback provisions, and other health care fraud provisions, leading to the possibility of greatly increased qui tam suits by relators for perceived violations. Industry data indicates that a significant portion of IVIG volume may be used to fill physician prescriptions for indications not approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities. Violations or allegations of violations of the foregoing restrictions could materially and adversely affect our business. We are required to report detailed pricing information, net of included discounts, rebates and other concessions, to CMS for the purpose of calculating national reimbursement levels, certain federal prices and certain federal and state rebate obligations. We have established systems for collecting and reporting this data accurately to CMS and have instituted a compliance program to assure that the information collected is complete in all respects. If we report pricing information that is not accurate to the federal government, we could be subject to fines and other sanctions that could adversely affect their business. To market and sell our products outside of the U.S., we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and comply with regulatory requirements in such jurisdictions. The approval procedures vary among countries in complexity and timing. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the U.S. on a timely basis, if at all, which would preclude us from commercializing products in those markets. In addition, some countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, regulate the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In these countries, pricing discussions with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. Such trials may be time consuming and expensive and may not show an advantage in efficacy for our products. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, in either the U.S. or the European Union, we could be adversely affected. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws and related laws, and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity in recent years. Under the FCPA, the U.S. has increasingly focused on regulating the conduct by U.S. businesses occurring outside of the U.S., generally prohibiting remuneration to foreign 26 Table of Contents officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Also, in some countries we may rely on third parties for the marketing and distribution of our products, and these parties may lack sufficient internal compliance resources, and may operate in foreign markets involving substantial corruption. If our efforts to monitor these parties fail to detect potential wrongdoing, we could be held responsible for the noncompliance of these third parties with applicable laws and regulations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to extensive government regulatory compliance and ethics oversight. Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. We have enacted anticorruption, privacy, healthcare and corporate compliance policies and procedures that govern our business practices and those of our distributors and suppliers. These policies and procedures are effectuated through education, training and monitoring of our employees, distributors and suppliers. In addition, to enhance compliance with applicable health care laws and mitigate potential liability in the event of noncompliance, regulatory authorities, such as HHSs Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, have recommended the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive health care compliance program that generally contains the elements of an effective compliance and ethics program described in Section 8B2.1 of the U.S. Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual. Increasing numbers of U.S.-based pharmaceutical companies have such programs, and we have adopted U.S. healthcare compliance and ethics programs that generally incorporate the HHS OIGs recommendations. However, our adoption and enforcement of these various policies and procedures does not ensure that we will avoid investigation or the imposition of penalties by applicable government agencies. We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Our business involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, various biological compounds and chemicals. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident, spill or release of any regulated chemicals or substances occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, including for investigation, remediation and monitoring of the contamination, including natural resource damages, the costs of which could be substantial. As owner and operators of real property, we could also be held liable for the presence of hazardous substances as a result of prior site uses or activities, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct that caused or contributed to the presence or release of such hazardous substance on our property. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials and chemicals. Although we maintain workers compensation insurance to cover the costs and expenses that may be incurred due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us for claims arising in the U.S. Additional or more stringent federal, state or local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. We may incur substantial capital costs and operating expenses to comply with any of these laws or regulations and the terms and conditions of any permits required pursuant to such laws and regulations, including costs to install new or updated pollution control equipment, modify our operations or perform other corrective actions at our respective facilities. In addition, fines and penalties may be imposed for noncompliance with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or for the failure to have or comply with the terms and conditions of required environmental permits.
