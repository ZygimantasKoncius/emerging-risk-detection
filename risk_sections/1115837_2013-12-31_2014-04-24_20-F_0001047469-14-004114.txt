Operating income as a percentage of our total revenues increased insignificantly to 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 24.8% for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Russia operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased by 3.4% to RUB 94,873 million from RUB 91,773 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Russia operating income decreased insignificantly as a percentage of Russia revenues to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013, from 27.2% for the year ended December 31, 2012, mainly due to the increase in Russia revenues by 5.0% which was offset by the increase in Russia sundry operating expenses as a percentage of Russia revenues to 22.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 20.9% for the year ended December 31, 2012 as well as by the increase in Russia depreciation and amortization expense to 17.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 16.6% for the year ended December 31, 2012 as explained above.

We repaid approximately RUB 45,191 million of indebtedness in 2013. As of December 31, 2013, the total amount available to us under our credit facilities amounted to RUB 5.0 billion. We had total indebtedness of approximately RUB 219.1 billion as of December 31, 2013, including capital lease obligations, compared to approximately RUB 232.1 billion as of December 31, 2012. Our total interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, was RUB 17,673 million and RUB 15,498 million, net of amounts capitalized, respectively. See Note 15 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a description of our indebtedness. Capital Requirements We need capital to finance the following: capital expenditures, consisting of purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; acquisitions; repayment of debt and related interest payments; changes in working capital; and general corporate activities, including dividends. We anticipate that capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of long-term debt and dividends will represent the most significant uses of funds for several years to come. Our cash outlays for capital expenditures in 2011, 2012 and 2013 were RUB 72,802 million, 87,783 million and RUB 81,575 million, respectively. We expect to continue to finance most of our capital expenditure needs through our operating cash flows, and to the extent required, to incur additional indebtedness through borrowings or additional capital raising activities. Historically, a significant portion of our capital expenditures have been related to the installation and build-out of our network and expansion into new license areas. We expect that capital expenditures will remain a large portion of our cash outflows in connection with the continued installation and build-out of our network. We expect our total capital expenditures in 2014 to be approximately 21% of our total 2014 revenue. These investments are required to support the growth in our subscriber base (i.e., to improve network capacity), to maintain and modernize our mobile and fixed line networks, to develop our network in the regions and to continue with the roll out of LTE networks throughout Russia as well as the development of our proprietary retail chain in Russia. We expect that the development of LTE networks will be among our most significant capital expenditures and require considerable management resources. See "
