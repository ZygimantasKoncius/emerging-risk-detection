ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) OUR COMMON STOCK IS THINLY TRADED, AND THEREFORE, THE STOCK PRICE MAY FLUCTUATE MORE THAN THE STOCK MARKET AS A WHOLE As a result of the thin trading market for our stock, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole or the stock prices of similar companies. Without a larger float, common stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and as a result, the trading prices for our common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price than would be the case if public float were larger. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS The Company has no unresolved written comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding its periodic or current reports.
