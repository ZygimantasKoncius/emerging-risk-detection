BUSINESS Southern Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on November 9, 1945. Southern Company is domesticated under the laws of Georgia and is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation under the laws of Alabama. Southern Company owns all of the outstanding common stock of Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power, each of which is an operating public utility company. The traditional operating companies supply electric service in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Mississippi. More particular information relating to each of the traditional operating companies is as follows: Alabama Power is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Alabama on November 10, 1927, by the consolidation of a predecessor Alabama Power Company, Gulf Electric Company, and Houston Power Company. The predecessor Alabama Power Company had been in continuous existence since its incorporation in 1906. Georgia Power was incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia on June 26, 1930, and admitted to do business in Alabama on September 15, 1948. Effective July 1, 2006, Savannah Electric, formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company, was merged with and into Georgia Power. Gulf Power is a Florida corporation that has had a continuous existence since it was originally organized under the laws of the State of Maine on November 2, 1925. Gulf Power was admitted to do business in Florida on January 15, 1926, in Mississippi on October 25, 1976, and in Georgia on November 20, 1984. Gulf Power became a Florida corporation after being domesticated under the laws of the State of Florida on November 2, 2005. Mississippi Power was incorporated under the laws of the State of Mississippi on July 12, 1972, was admitted to do business in Alabama on November 28, 1972, and effective December 21, 1972, by the merger into it of the predecessor Mississippi Power Company, succeeded to the business and properties of the latter company. The predecessor Mississippi Power Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maine on November 24, 1924 and was admitted to do business in Mississippi on December 23, 1924 and in Alabama on December 7, 1962. In addition, Southern Company owns all of the common stock of Southern Power, which is also an operating public utility company. Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware on January 8, 2001 and was admitted to do business in the States of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia on January 10, 2001, in the State of Mississippi on January 30, 2001, and in the State of North Carolina on February 19, 2007. Southern Company also owns all the outstanding common stock or membership interests of SouthernLINC Wireless, Southern Nuclear, SCS, Southern Holdings, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and markets these services to the public and also provides wholesale fiber optic solutions to telecommunication providers in the Southeast. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Alabama Powers and Georgia Powers nuclear plants. SCS is the system service company providing, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding subsidiary for Southern Companys investments in leveraged leases and various other energy-related businesses. Alabama Power and Georgia Power each own 50% of the outstanding common stock of SEGCO. SEGCO is an operating public utility company that owns electric generating units with an aggregate capacity of 1,019,680 kilowatts at Plant Gaston on the Coosa River near Wilsonville, Alabama. Alabama Power and Georgia Power are each entitled to one-half of SEGCOs capacity and energy. Alabama Power acts as SEGCOs agent in the operation of SEGCOs units and furnishes coal to SEGCO as fuel for its units. SEGCO also owns one 230,000 volt transmission line extending from Plant Gaston to the Georgia state line at which point connection is made with the Georgia Power transmission line system. I-1 Table of Contents Southern Companys segment information is included in Note 11 to the financial statements of Southern Company in Item 8 herein.

Southern Companys internet address is www.southerncompany.com. The Southern Company System Traditional Operating Companies The traditional operating companies own generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional information on the traditional operating companies generating facilities. The transmission facilities of each of the traditional operating companies are connected to the respective companys own generating plants and other sources of power and are interconnected with the transmission facilities of the other traditional operating companies and SEGCO by means of heavy-duty high voltage lines. For information on Georgia Powers integrated transmission system, see Territory Served by the Traditional Operating Companies and Southern Power herein. Operating contracts covering arrangements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems provide for capacity exchanges, capacity purchases and sales, transfers of economy energy, and other similar transactions. Additionally, the traditional operating companies have entered into voluntary reliability agreements with the subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation, Florida Electric Power Coordinating Group, and TVA and with Progress Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company, and Virginia Electric and Power Company, each of which provides for the establishment and periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and operation of generation and transmission facilities, maintenance schedules, load retention programs, emergency operations, and other matters affecting the reliability of bulk power supply. The traditional operating companies have joined with other utilities in the Southeast (including those referred to above) to form the SERC to augment further the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the SERC, the traditional operating companies are represented on the National Electric Reliability Council. The IIC provides for coordinating operations of the power producing facilities of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power and the capacities available to such companies from non-affiliated sources and for the pooling of surplus energy available for interchange. Coordinated operation of the entire interconnected system is conducted through a central power supply coordination office maintained by SCS. The available sources of energy are allocated to the traditional operating companies and Southern Power to provide the most economical sources of power consistent with reliable operation. The resulting benefits and savings are apportioned among each of the companies. See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  FERC Matters  Intercompany Interchange Contract of each registrant in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of each registrant, all under FERC Matters  Intercompany Interchange Contract in Item 8 herein for information on the settlement of the FERC proceeding related to the IIC. Southern Company, each traditional operating company, Southern Power, Southern Nuclear, SEGCO, and other subsidiaries have contracted with SCS to furnish, at direct or allocated cost and upon request, the following services: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications, and other services with respect to business and operations and power pool transactions. Southern Power and SouthernLINC Wireless have also secured from the traditional operating companies certain services which are furnished at cost and, in the case of Southern Power which is subject to FERC regulations, in compliance with such regulations. Alabama Power and Georgia Power each have a contract with Southern Nuclear to operate Plant Farley and Plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively. See Regulation  Nuclear Regulation herein for additional information. I-2 Table of Contents Southern Power Southern Power is an electric wholesale generation subsidiary with market-based rate authority from the FERC. Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation assets and sells electricity at market-based prices in the wholesale market. Southern Powers business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional operating companies but are subject to regulation by the FERC. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric transmission risks by making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to the PPAs. However, Southern Powers future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market, federal regulation, and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets. For additional information on Southern Powers business activities, see MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OVERVIEW  Business Activities of Southern Power in Item 7 herein. In June 2008, Southern Power completed construction on Plant Franklin Unit 3 which added 659 megawatts to the Southern Company system generating capacity. In December 2008, Southern Power announced plans to construct a 720 megawatt electric generating plant in North Carolina. This new plant is expected to go into commercial operation in 2012. As of December 31, 2008, Southern Power had 7,555 megawatts of nameplate capacity in commercial operation. Other Businesses Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding subsidiary for Southern Companys investments in leveraged leases and various other energy-related businesses. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and markets its services to non-affiliates within the Southeast. SouthernLINC Wireless delivers multiple wireless communication options including push to talk, cellular service, text messaging, wireless internet access, and wireless data. Its system covers approximately 128,000 square miles in the Southeast. SouthernLINC Wireless also provides wholesale fiber optic solutions to telecommunication providers in the Southeast under the name Southern Telecom. These efforts to invest in and develop new business opportunities offer potential returns exceeding those of rate-regulated operations. However, these activities also involve a higher degree of risk. I-3 Table of Contents Construction Programs The subsidiary companies of Southern Company are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads on their respective systems. For estimated construction and environmental expenditures for the periods 2009 through 2011, see Note 7 to the financial statements of each traditional operating company and Southern Power under Construction Program and Expansion Program, respectively, in Item 8 herein. Estimated construction costs in 2009 are expected to be apportioned approximately as follows: (in millions) Southern Company Alabama Georgia Gulf Mississippi Southern System* Power Power Power Power Power New generation $ 1,953 $  $ 1,209 $ 6 $ 48 $ 690 Environmental 1,448 584 472 335 28  Other generating facilities, including associated plant substations 543 232 178 42 11 59 New business 411 196 170 29 16  Transmission 434 76 313 25 20  Distribution 404 157 189 29 30  Nuclear fuel 238 90 148    General plant 222 79 75 12 10  $ 5,653 $ 1,414 $ 2,754 $ 478 $ 163 $ 749 * These amounts include the traditional operating companies and Southern Power (as detailed in the table above) as well as the amounts for the other subsidiaries. See Other Businesses herein for additional information. The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental statutes and regulations; changes in nuclear plants to meet new regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; PSC approvals; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. Under Georgia law, Georgia Power is required to file an IRP for approval by the Georgia PSC. Through the IRP process, the Georgia PSC must pre-certify the construction of new power plants and new PPAs. See Rate Matters  Integrated Resource Planning herein for additional information. See Regulation  Environmental Statutes and Regulations herein for additional information with respect to certain existing and proposed environmental requirements and PROPERTIES  Jointly-Owned Facilities in Item 2 herein for additional information concerning Alabama Powers, Georgia Powers, and Southern Powers joint ownership of certain generating units and related facilities with certain non-affiliated utilities. Financing Programs See each of the registrants MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY in Item 7 herein and Note 6 to the financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 herein for information concerning financing programs. Fuel Supply The traditional operating companies and SEGCOs supply of electricity is derived predominantly from coal. Southern Powers supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas. See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  RESULTS OF OPERATION  Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses of Southern Company and each traditional operating company in Item 7 herein for information regarding the electricity generated and the average cost of fuel in cents per net kilowatt-hour generated for the years 2006 through 2008. I-4 Table of Contents The traditional operating companies have agreements in place from which they expect to receive approximately 100% of their coal burn requirements in 2009. These agreements have terms ranging between one and seven years. In 2008, the weighted average sulfur content of all coal burned by the traditional operating companies was 0.74% sulfur. This sulfur level, along with banked and purchased sulfur dioxide allowances, allowed the traditional operating companies to remain within limits set by the Phase II acid rain requirements of the Clean Air Act. In 2008, Southern Company purchased approximately $63.5 million of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission allowances to be used in current and future periods. As additional environmental regulations are proposed that impact the utilization of coal, the traditional operating companies fuel mix will be monitored to ensure that the traditional operating companies remain in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, Southern Company and the traditional operating companies will continue to evaluate the need to purchase additional emission allowances and the timing of capital expenditures for emission control equipment. See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  Environmental Matters of Southern Company and each traditional operating company in Item 7 herein for information on the Clean Air Act and global climate issues. SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, has agreements in place for the natural gas burn requirements of the Southern Company system. For 2009, SCS has contracted for 220 billion cubic feet of natural gas supply. These agreements cover remaining terms up to 10 years. In addition to gas supply, SCS has contracts in place for both firm gas transportation and storage. Management believes that these contracts provide sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation, and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company systems natural gas generating units. Changes in fuel prices to the traditional operating companies are generally reflected in fuel adjustment clauses contained in rate schedules. See Rate Matters  Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans herein for additional information. Southern Powers PPAs generally provide that the counterparty is responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have numerous contracts covering a portion of their nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services, enrichment services, and fuel fabrication. These contracts have varying expiration dates and most of them are for less than 10 years. Management believes that sufficient capacity for nuclear fuel supplies and processing exists to preclude the impairment of normal operations of the Southern Company systems nuclear generating units. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE, that provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in 1998, as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power are pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power under Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs in Item 8 herein for additional information. Territory Served by the Traditional Operating Companies and Southern Power The territory in which the traditional operating companies provide electric service comprises most of the states of Alabama and Georgia together with the northwestern portion of Florida and southeastern Mississippi. In this territory there are non-affiliated electric distribution systems which obtain some or all of their power requirements either directly or indirectly from the traditional operating companies. The territory has an area of approximately 120,000 square miles and an estimated population of approximately 13 million. Southern Power sells electricity at market-based prices in the wholesale market to investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and electric cooperatives. Alabama Power is engaged, within the State of Alabama, in the generation and purchase of electricity and the transmission, distribution, and sale of such electricity at retail in over 650 communities (including Anniston, Birmingham, Gadsden, Mobile, Montgomery, and Tuscaloosa) and at wholesale to 15 municipally-owned electric distribution systems, 11 of which are served indirectly through sales to AMEA, and two rural distributing cooperative associations. Alabama Power owns coal reserves near its Plant Gorgas and uses the output of coal from the reserves in its generating plants. Alabama Power also sells, and cooperates with dealers in promoting the sale of, electric appliances. I-5 Table of Contents Georgia Power is engaged in the generation and purchase of electricity and the transmission, distribution, and sale of such electricity within the State of Georgia at retail in over 600 communities (including Athens, Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, Macon, Rome, and Savannah), as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale currently to OPC, MEAG, Dalton, Hampton, and 30 electric cooperatives. Gulf Power is engaged, within the northwestern portion of Florida, in the generation and purchase of electricity and the transmission, distribution, and sale of such electricity at retail in 71 communities (including Pensacola, Panama City, and Fort Walton Beach), as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale to a non-affiliated utility and a municipality. Mississippi Power is engaged in the generation and purchase of electricity and the transmission, distribution, and sale of such energy within 23 counties in southeastern Mississippi, at retail in 123 communities (including Biloxi, Gulfport, Hattiesburg, Laurel, Meridian, and Pascagoula), as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale to one municipality, six rural electric distribution cooperative associations, and one generating and transmitting cooperative. For information relating to kilowatt-hour sales by classification for the traditional operating companies, see MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS of each traditional operating company in Item 7 herein. Also, for information relating to the sources of revenues for Southern Company, each traditional operating company, and Southern Power, reference is made to Item 6 herein. The RUS has authority to make loans to cooperative associations or corporations to enable them to provide electric service to customers in rural sections of the country. There are 71 electric cooperative organizations operating in the territory in which the traditional operating companies provide electric service at retail or wholesale. One of these organizations, PowerSouth, is a generating and transmitting cooperative selling power to several distributing cooperatives, municipal systems, and other customers in south Alabama and northwest Florida. PowerSouth owns generating units with approximately 1,776 megawatts of nameplate capacity, including an undivided 8.16% ownership interest in Alabama Powers Plant Miller Units 1 and 2. PowerSouths facilities were financed with RUS loans secured by long-term contracts requiring distributing cooperatives to take their requirements from PowerSouth to the extent such energy is available. Alabama Power and Gulf Power have entered into separate agreements with PowerSouth involving interconnection between their respective systems. The delivery of capacity and energy from PowerSouth to certain distributing cooperatives in the service areas of Alabama Power and Gulf Power is governed by the Southern Company/PowerSouth Network Transmission Service Agreement. The rates for this service to PowerSouth are on file with the FERC. See PROPERTIES  Jointly-Owned Facilities in Item 2 herein for details of Alabama Powers joint-ownership with PowerSouth of a portion of Plant Miller. Four electric cooperative associations, financed by the RUS, operate within Gulf Powers service area. These cooperatives purchase their full requirements from PowerSouth and SEPA (a federal power marketing agency). A non-affiliated utility also operates within Gulf Powers service area and purchases its full requirements from Gulf Power. Mississippi Power has an interchange agreement with SMEPA, a generating and transmitting cooperative, pursuant to which various services are provided, including the furnishing of protective capacity by Mississippi Power to SMEPA. There are also 65 municipally-owned electric distribution systems operating in the territory in which the traditional operating companies provide electric service at retail or wholesale. Forty-eight municipally-owned electric distribution systems and one county-owned system receive their requirements through MEAG, which was established by a Georgia state statute in 1975. MEAG serves these requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of which are acquired and jointly-owned with Georgia Power, power purchased from Georgia Power, and purchases from other resources. MEAG also has a pseudo scheduling and services agreement with I-6 Table of Contents Georgia Power. Dalton serves its requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of which are acquired and jointly-owned with Georgia Power, and through purchases from Georgia Power pursuant to their partial requirements tariff. In addition, Georgia Power serves the full requirements of Hamptons electric distribution system under a market-based contract. See PROPERTIES  Jointly-Owned Facilities in Item 2 herein for additional information. Georgia Power has entered into substantially similar agreements with Georgia Transmission Corporation (formerly OPCs transmission division), MEAG, and Dalton providing for the establishment of an integrated transmission system to carry the power and energy of all parties. The agreements require an investment by each party in the integrated transmission system in proportion to its respective share of the aggregate system load. See PROPERTIES  Jointly-Owned Facilities in Item 2 herein for additional information. Southern Power has PPAs with some of the traditional operating companies and with other investor owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and electric cooperatives. See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  Power Sales Agreements of Southern Power in Item 7 herein for additional information concerning Southern Powers PPAs. SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional operating companies, also has a contract with SEPA providing for the use of the traditional operating companies facilities at government expense to deliver to certain cooperatives and municipalities, entitled by federal statute to preference in the purchase of power from SEPA, quantities of power equivalent to the amounts of power allocated to them by SEPA from certain United States government hydroelectric projects. The retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the State of Georgia are regulated by the Territorial Electric Service Act of 1973. Pursuant to the provisions of this Act, all areas within existing municipal limits were assigned to the primary electric supplier therein. Areas outside of such municipal limits were either to be assigned or to be declared open for customer choice of supplier by action of the Georgia PSC pursuant to standards set forth in this Act. Consistent with such standards, the Georgia PSC has assigned substantially all of the land area in the state to a supplier. Notwithstanding such assignments, this Act provides that any new customer locating outside of 1973 municipal limits and having a connected load of at least 900 kilowatts may exercise a one-time choice for the life of the premises to receive electric service from the supplier of its choice. See Competition herein for additional information. Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued Grandfather Certificates of public convenience and necessity to Mississippi Power and to six distribution rural cooperatives operating in southeastern Mississippi, then served in whole or in part by Mississippi Power, authorizing them to distribute electricity in certain specified geographically described areas of the state. The six cooperatives serve approximately 325,000 retail customers in a certificated area of approximately 10,300 square miles. In areas included in a Grandfather Certificate, the utility holding such certificate may, without further certification, extend its lines up to five miles; other extensions within that area by such utility, or by other utilities, may not be made except upon a showing of, and a grant of a certificate of, public convenience and necessity. Areas included in such a certificate which are subsequently annexed to municipalities may continue to be served by the holder of the certificate, irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing municipality. On the other hand, the holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into such newly annexed area without authorization by the Mississippi PSC. Competition The electric utility industry in the United States is continuing to evolve as a result of regulatory and competitive factors. Among the early primary agents of change was the Energy Act of 1992 which allowed IPPs to access a utilitys transmission network in order to sell electricity to other utilities. The competition for retail energy sales among competing suppliers of energy is influenced by various factors, including price, availability, technological advancements, service, and reliability. These factors are, in turn, affected by, among other influences, regulatory, political, and environmental considerations, taxation, and supply. Generally, the traditional operating companies have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition in their respective retail service territories in varying degrees as the result of self-generation (as described above) by I-7 Table of Contents customers and other factors. See also Territory Served by the Traditional Operating Companies and Southern Power herein for additional information concerning suppliers of electricity operating within or near the areas served at retail by the traditional operating companies. Southern Power competes with investor owned utilities, IPPs, and others for wholesale energy sales primarily in the Southeastern United States wholesale market. The needs of this market are driven by the demands of end users in the Southeast and the generation available. Southern Powers success in wholesale energy sales is influenced by various factors including reliability and availability of Southern Powers plants, availability of transmission to serve the demand, price, and Southern Powers ability to contain costs. Alabama Power currently has cogeneration contracts in effect with nine industrial customers. Under the terms of these contracts, Alabama Power purchases excess generation of such companies. During 2008, Alabama Power purchased approximately 114 million kilowatt-hours from such companies at a cost of $5.6 million. Georgia Power currently has contracts in effect with eight small power producers whereby Georgia Power purchases their excess generation. During 2008, Georgia Power purchased 7.2 million kilowatt-hours from such companies at a cost of $1.0 million. Georgia Power has PPAs for electricity with two cogeneration facilities. Payments are subject to reductions for failure to meet minimum capacity output. During 2008, Georgia Power purchased 222.9 million kilowatt-hours at a cost of $67.9 million from these facilities. Also during 2008, Georgia Power purchased energy from seven customer-owned generating facilities. Six of the seven customers provide only energy to Georgia Power. These six customers make no capacity commitment and are not dispatched by Georgia Power. Georgia Power does have a contract with the remaining customer for eight megawatts of dispatchable capacity and energy. During 2008, Georgia Power purchased a total of 59.1 million kilowatt-hours from the seven customers at a cost of approximately $3.0 million. Gulf Power currently has agreements in effect with various industrial, commercial, and qualifying facilities pursuant to which Gulf Power purchases as available energy from customer-owned generation. During 2008, Gulf Power purchased 41.1 million kilowatt-hours from such companies for approximately $2.7 million. Mississippi Power currently has a cogeneration agreement in effect with one of its industrial customers. Under the terms of this contract, Mississippi Power purchases any excess generation. During 2008, this customer had no excess generation. Seasonality The demand for electric power generation is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. At the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, the demand for power peaks during the summer months, with market prices reflecting the demand of power and available generating resources at that time. Power demand peaks can also be recorded during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power have historically sold less power when weather conditions are milder. Regulation State Commissions The traditional operating companies are subject to the jurisdiction of their respective state PSCs. The PSCs have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities operating in the respective states, including their rates, service regulations, sales of securities (except for the Mississippi PSC), and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and the Mississippi PSC, in part, retail service territories. See Territory Served by the Traditional Operating Companies and Southern Power and Rate Matters herein for additional information. I-8 Table of Contents Federal Power Act The traditional operating companies, Southern Power and its generation subsidiaries, and SEGCO are all public utilities engaged in wholesale sales of energy in interstate commerce and therefore are subject to the rate, financial, and accounting jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. The FERC must approve certain financings and allows an at cost standard for services rendered by system service companies such as SCS. The FERC is also authorized to establish regional reliability organizations which are authorized to enforce reliability standards, to address impediments to the construction of transmission, and to prohibit manipulative energy trading practices. Alabama Power and Georgia Power are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act or the earlier Federal Water Power Act applicable to licensees with respect to their hydroelectric developments. Among the hydroelectric projects subject to licensing by the FERC are 14 existing Alabama Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1,662,400 kilowatts and 18 existing Georgia Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1,074,696 kilowatts. On May 22, 2008, the FERC issued a new 30-year license for the Morgan Falls project, located on the Chattahoochee River near Atlanta, with an effective start date of March 1, 2009. In 2007, Georgia Power began the relicensing process for Bartletts Ferry which is located on the Chattahoochee River near Columbus, Georgia. The current Bartletts Ferry license expires in 2014 and the application for a new license is expected to be submitted to the FERC in 2012. In July 2005, Alabama Power filed two applications with the FERC for new 50-year licenses for its seven hydroelectric developments on the Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay, Mitchell, Jordan, and Bouldin) and for the Lewis Smith and Bankhead developments on the Warrior River. The FERC licenses for all of these nine developments expired in July and August 2007. The FERC issued an annual license for the Coosa developments in August 2007 and issued an annual license for the Warrior developments in September 2007. Both of these licenses were automatically renewed in 2008 pursuant to FERC regulations. These annual licenses provide the FERC with additional time to complete its review of the license applications. In 2006, Alabama Power initiated the process of developing an application to relicense the Martin hydroelectric project located on the Tallapoosa River. The current Martin license will expire in 2013 and the application for a new license is expected to be filed with the FERC in 2011. See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  FERC Matters  Hydro Relicensing of Alabama Power in Item 7 herein for additional information. Georgia Power and OPC also have a license, expiring in 2027, for the Rocky Mountain Plant, a pure pumped storage facility of 847,800 kilowatt capacity. See PROPERTIES  Jointly-Owned Facilities in Item 2 herein for additional information. Licenses for all projects, excluding those discussed above, expire in the period 2015-2034 in the case of Alabama Powers projects and in the period 2014-2039 in the case of Georgia Powers projects. Upon or after the expiration of each license, the United States Government, by act of Congress, may take over the project or the FERC may relicense the project either to the original licensee or to a new licensee. In the event of takeover or relicensing to another, the original licensee is to be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, such compensation to reflect the net investment of the licensee in the project, not in excess of the fair value of the property, plus reasonable damages to other property of the licensee resulting from the severance therefrom of the property. If the FERC does not act on the new license application prior to the expiration of the existing license, the FERC is required to issue annual licenses, under the same terms and conditions of the existing license, until a new license is issued. Nuclear Regulation Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Nuclear are subject to regulation by the NRC. The NRC is responsible for licensing and regulating nuclear facilities and materials and for conducting research in support of the licensing and regulatory process, as mandated by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978; and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and other applicable statutes. These responsibilities also include protecting public health and safety, protecting the environment, protecting and safeguarding nuclear I-9 Table of Contents materials and nuclear power plants in the interest of national security, and assuring conformity with antitrust laws. The NRC operating licenses for Plant Vogtle units 1 and 2 currently expire in January 2027 and February 2029, respectively. In January 2002, the NRC granted Georgia Power a 20-year extension of the licenses for both units at Plant Hatch which permits the operation of units 1 and 2 until 2034 and 2038, respectively. Georgia Power filed an application with the NRC in June 2007 to extend the licenses for Plant Vogtle units 1 and 2 for an additional 20 years. Georgia Power anticipates the NRC may make a decision regarding the license extension for Plant Vogtle in 2009. In May 2005, the NRC granted Alabama Power a 20-year extension of the licenses for both units at Plant Farley which permits operation of units 1 and 2 until 2037 and 2041, respectively. In August 2006, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power, OPC, MEAG, and Dalton (collectively, Owners), filed an application with the NRC for an early site permit approving two additional nuclear units on the site of Plant Vogtle. See Note 4 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Georgia Power in Item 8 herein for additional information on these co-owners. On March 31, 2008, Southern Nuclear filed an application with the NRC for a combined construction and operating license for the new units. On April 8, 2008, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the Owners, and a consortium consisting of Westinghouse and Stone & Webster (collectively, Consortium) entered into an engineering, procurement, and construction agreement to design, engineer, procure, construct, and test two AP1000 nuclear units with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 megawatts each and related facilities, structures, and improvements at Plant Vogtle. See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  Construction Projects of Southern Company and MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  Nuclear  Construction of Georgia Power in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Georgia Power under Nuclear and Nuclear Construction, respectively in Item 8 herein for additional information. See Notes 1 and 9 to the financial statements of Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power in Item 8 herein for information on nuclear decommissioning costs and nuclear insurance. FERC Matters See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  FERC Matters of each of the registrants in Item 7 herein for information on matters regarding the FERC. Environmental Statutes and Regulations Southern Companys operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air, water, and land resources. Compliance with these existing environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions. There is no assurance, however, that all such costs will be recovered. Compliance with the federal Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been, and will continue to be, a significant focus for Southern Company, each traditional operating company, Southern Power, and SEGCO. In addition, existing environmental laws and regulations may be changed or new laws and regulations may be adopted or otherwise become applicable to Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, Southern Power, or SEGCO, including laws and regulations designed to address global climate change, air quality, water quality, or other environmental, public health, and welfare concerns. See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  Environmental Matters of Southern Company and each of the traditional operating companies in Item 7 herein for additional information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental issues, including the litigation brought by the EPA under the New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act and possible climate change legislation and regulation. Also see MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  Environmental Matters of Southern Power in Item 7 herein for information about the environmental issues and possible climate change legislation and regulation. I-10 Table of Contents Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and SEGCO are unable to predict at this time what additional steps they may be required to take as a result of the implementation of existing or future requirements pertaining to climate change, air quality, water quality, and management of waste materials and combustion byproducts, including coal ash, but such steps could adversely affect system operations and result in substantial additional costs. The outcome of the matters mentioned above under Regulation cannot now be determined, except that these developments may result in delays in obtaining appropriate licenses for generating facilities, increased construction and operating costs, or reduced generation, the nature and extent of which, while not determinable at this time, could be substantial. Rate Matters Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans The rates and service regulations of the traditional operating companies are uniform for each class of service throughout their respective service areas. Rates for residential electric service are generally of the block type based upon kilowatt-hours used and include minimum charges. Residential and other rates contain separate customer charges. Rates for commercial service are presently of the block type and, for large customers, the billing demand is generally used to determine capacity and minimum bill charges. These large customers rates are generally based upon usage by the customer and include rates with special features to encourage off-peak usage. Additionally, Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power are generally allowed by their respective state PSCs to negotiate the terms and cost of service to large customers. Such terms and cost of service, however, are subject to final state PSC approval. Fuel and net purchased energy costs are recovered through specific fuel cost recovery provisions at the traditional operating companies. These fuel cost recovery provisions are adjusted to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as needed. Gulf Powers and Mississippi Powers fuel cost recovery provisions are adjusted annually to reflect increases or decreases in such costs. Georgia Power expects to file for an adjustment to its fuel cost recovery rate on March 13, 2009. Alabama Powers fuel clause is adjusted as required. Revenues are adjusted for differences between recoverable costs and amounts actually recovered in current rates. Approved environmental compliance and storm damage costs are recovered at Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power through cost recovery provisions approved by their respective state PSCs. Within limits approved by their respective PSCs, these rates are adjusted to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as required. Georgia Powers environmental compliance costs were recovered in base rates through 2007. Under the 2007 retail rate plan, an environmental compliance cost recovery tariff was implemented effective January 1, 2008 to allow for recovery of most of the costs related to environmental controls scheduled for completion between 2008 and 2010 that are mandated by state and federal regulation. Georgia Power has also requested that the Georgia PSC certify the construction of environmental controls for Plants Branch and Hammond. Georgia Power also continues to recover storm damage and new plant costs through its base rates. See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  Construction Projects  Nuclear of Southern Company and MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  Nuclear  Construction of Georgia Power in Item 7 herein for information regarding legislation currently being considered in the State of Georgia to allow recovery of financing costs for nuclear construction projects during the construction period. Alabama Power recovers the cost of certificated new plant and purchased power capacity and Gulf Power recovers purchased power capacity and conservation costs through cost recovery provisions which are adjusted as required to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as needed. Revenues are adjusted for differences between recoverable costs and amounts actually recovered in current rates. See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  PSC Matters of Southern Company and each of the traditional operating companies in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under Alabama Power Retail Regulatory Matters and Georgia Power Retail I-11 Table of Contents Regulatory Matters and Note 3 to the financial statements of each of the traditional operating companies under Retail Regulatory Matters in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters. Also, see Note 1 to the financial statements of Southern Company and each of the traditional operating companies in Item 8 herein for a discussion of recovery of fuel costs, storm damage costs, and environmental compliance costs through rates. The traditional operating companies and Southern Power are authorized by the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate. See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  FERC Matters  Market-Based Rate Authority of each registrant in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of each registrant under FERC Matters  Market-Based Rate Authority in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters. Integrated Resource Planning Triennially, Georgia Power must file an IRP with the Georgia PSC that specifies how it intends to meet the future electrical needs of its customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC under state law will certify any new demand-side or supply-side resources. Once certified, the lesser of actual or certified construction costs and purchased power costs will be recoverable through rates. In July 2007, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Powers 2007 IRP including the following provisions: (1) retiring the coal units at Plant McDonough and replacing them with combined-cycle natural gas units; (2) approving new energy efficiency pilot programs and rate recovery of demand-side management programs; (3) approving pursuit of up to three new renewable generation projects with a Georgia Power ownership interest; and (4) establishing new nuclear units as a preferred option to meet demand in the 2015/2016 timeframe (2007 IRP Order). On August 1, 2008, Georgia Power filed with the Georgia PSC an application for the certification of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the 2008 IRP update (Updated IRP). The application requested that the Georgia PSC take the following actions: (1) certify the proposed Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; (2) approve the Updated IRP; (3) allow construction work in progress in rate base for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; (4) institute quarterly construction monitoring and treatment of indexed costs; (5) approve Georgia Powers recommendation to install emissions controls at Plants Branch and Yates; and (6) approve the deferral for later cost recovery of the significant expenses incurred in developing and evaluating coal-fired generation, as required by the 2007 IRP Order. The Georgia PSC is scheduled to render a decision in March 2009. Georgia Power also filed with the Georgia PSC an application for certification to convert the coal-fired unit at Plant Mitchell to a renewable wood biomass facility which would begin service in June 2012. The Georgia PSC is scheduled to render a decision in March 2009. If certified, construction on this conversion is expected to begin in the spring of 2011. See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  Construction Projects - Nuclear of Southern Company and MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  Nuclear  Construction of Georgia Power in Item 7 herein for additional information regarding the proposed Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Mississippi Base Load Construction Legislation In the 2008 regular session of the Mississippi legislature, a bill was passed and signed by the Governor on May 9, 2008 to enhance the Mississippi PSCs authority to facilitate development and construction of base load generation in the State of Mississippi (Baseload Act). The Baseload Act authorizes, but does not require, the Mississippi PSC to adopt a cost recovery mechanism that includes in retail base rates, prior to and during construction, all or a portion of the prudently incurred pre-construction and construction costs incurred by a utility in constructing a base load electric generating plant. Prior to the passage of the Baseload Act, such costs would traditionally be recovered only after the plant was placed in service. The Baseload Act also provides for periodic prudence reviews by the Mississippi PSC and prohibits the cancellation of any such generating plant without the approval of the Mississippi PSC. In the event of cancellation of the construction of the plant without approval of the Mississippi PSC, the Baseload Act authorizes the Mississippi PSC to make a public interest I-12 Table of Contents determination as to whether and to what extent the utility will be afforded rate recovery for costs incurred in connection with such cancelled generating plant. The effect of this legislation on Southern Company and Mississippi Power cannot now be determined. On January 16, 2009, Mississippi Power filed for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with the Mississippi PSC to allow construction of a new electric generating plant located in Kemper County, Mississippi. As part of its filing, Mississippi Power has requested certain rate recovery treatment in accordance with the base load construction legislation. See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  Construction Projects  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle and Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle of Southern Company and Mississippi Power, respectively, in Item 7 herein for additional information. Employee Relations The Southern Company system had a total of 27,276 employees on its payroll at December 31, 2008. Employees at December 31, 2008 Alabama Power 6,997 Georgia Power* 9,337 Gulf Power 1,342 Mississippi Power 1,317 SCS 4,536 Southern Holdings**  Southern Nuclear 3,346 Southern Power***  Other 401 Total 27,276 * Georgia Power has initiated a voluntary attrition plan under which participating employees may elect to resign from their positions as of March 31, 2009. Approximately 700 employees who have indicated an interest in participating in the plan have been selected by Georgia Power and are permitted to resign and receive severance. The ultimate number of employees who resign under the plan cannot be determined at this time. ** Southern Holdings has agreements with SCS whereby all employee services are rendered at cost. *** Southern Power has no employees. Southern Power has agreements with SCS and the traditional operating companies whereby employee services are rendered at amounts in compliance with FERC regulations. The traditional operating companies have separate agreements with local unions of the IBEW generally covering wages, working conditions, and procedures for handling grievances and arbitration. These agreements apply with certain exceptions to operating, maintenance, and construction employees. Alabama Power has agreements with the IBEW on a five-year contract extending to August 15, 2009. Upon notice given at least 60 days prior to that date, negotiations may be initiated with respect to agreement terms to be effective after such date. Georgia Power had an agreement with the IBEW covering wages and working conditions, which was in effect through June 30, 2008. The terms of the expired agreement are still being followed while negotiations on a new agreement are ongoing. Gulf Power has an agreement with the IBEW covering wages and working conditions, which is in effect through October 14, 2009. Upon notice given at least 60 days prior to that date, negotiations may be initiated with respect to agreement terms to be effective after such date. Mississippi Power has an agreement with the IBEW covering wages and working conditions, which is in effect until I-13 Table of Contents August 16, 2010. Upon notice given at least 60 days prior to that date, negotiations may be initiated with respect to agreement terms to be effective after such date. Southern Nuclear and the IBEW continue in negotiations to ratify a new labor agreement for certain employees at Plants Hatch and Vogtle. The three-year agreement that was set to expire on June 30, 2008 was extended for one year and remains in full effect. A three-year agreement with the IBEW representing certain employees at Plant Farley is in effect through August 15, 2009. Upon notice given at least 60 days prior to August 15, 2009, negotiations may be initiated with respect to a new agreement after such date. The agreements also subject the terms of the pension plans for the companies discussed above to collective bargaining with the unions at either a five-year or a 10-year cycle, depending upon union and company actions. I-14 Table of Contents Item 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, including MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL in Item 7 of each registrant, and other documents filed by Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries with the SEC from time to time, the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating Southern Company and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries. Risks Related to the Energy Industry Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial governmental regulation. Compliance with current and future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals, permits, and certificates may result in substantial costs to Southern Company and its subsidiaries. Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, are subject to substantial regulation from federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. Southern Company and its subsidiaries are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain numerous permits, approvals, and certificates from the governmental agencies that regulate various aspects of their businesses, including customer rates, service regulations, retail service territories, sales of securities, asset acquisitions and sales, accounting policies and practices, and the operation of fossil-fuel, hydroelectric, and nuclear generating facilities. For example, the rates charged to wholesale customers by the traditional operating companies and by Southern Power must be approved by the FERC and failure to maintain FERC market-based rate authority may impact the rates charged to wholesale customers. Additionally, the respective state PSCs must approve the traditional operating companies rates for retail customers. While the retail rates approved by the respective state PSCs are designed to provide for recovery of costs and a return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that a state PSC will not deem certain costs to be imprudently incurred and not subject to recovery. Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe the necessary permits, approvals, and certificates have been obtained for their respective existing operations and that their respective businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, the impact of any future revision or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries cannot now be predicted. Changes in regulation or the imposition of additional regulations could influence the operating environment of Southern Company and its subsidiaries and may result in substantial costs. Risks Related to Environmental and Climate Change Legislation and Regulation Southern Companys and the traditional operating companies costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant. The costs of compliance with future environmental laws, including laws and regulations designed to address global climate change and renewable energy standards, and the incurrence of environmental liabilities could affect unit retirement decisions and negatively impact the net income, cash flows, and financial condition of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power. Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental requirements which, among other things, regulate air emissions, water usage and discharges, and the management of hazardous and solid waste in order to adequately protect the environment. Compliance with these legal requirements requires Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power to commit significant expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment, environmental monitoring, emissions fees, and permits at all of their respective facilities. These expenditures are significant and Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power expect that they will increase in the future. Through 2008, Southern Company had invested approximately $6.3 billion in capital projects to comply with these requirements, with annual totals of $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion, and $661 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Southern Company expects that capital expenditures to assure compliance with existing and new statutes and regulations will be an additional $1.4 billion, $737 million, and $871 million for 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. Because Southern Companys compliance strategy is impacted by changes to existing environmental I-15 Table of Contents laws, statutes, and regulations, the cost, availability, and existing inventory of emission allowances, and Southern Companys fuel mix, the ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time. If Southern Company, any traditional operating company, or Southern Power fails to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines. The EPA has filed civil actions against Alabama Power and Georgia Power alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Southern Company is a party to suits alleging emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming. An adverse outcome in any of these cases could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect unit retirement and replacement decisions, and results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, such as opacity and air and water quality standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws and regulations related to global climate change, air quality, combustion byproducts, including coal ash, or other environmental and health concerns may be adopted or become applicable to Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power. For example, federal legislative proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy standards continue to be strongly considered in Congress, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has been identified as a high priority by the current Administration. In addition, some states, including Florida, are considering or have undertaken actions to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2007, the U. S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. The EPA is currently developing its response to this decision. Regulatory decisions that will follow from this response may have implications for both new and existing stationary sources, such as power plants. New or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, such as those related to climate change, could affect unit retirement and replacement decisions and/or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on the facilities of the traditional operating companies or Southern Power or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce the net income of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power. The cost impact of such legislation, regulation, or new interpretations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time. General Risks Related to Operation of Southern Companys Utility Subsidiaries The regional power market in which Southern Company and its utility subsidiaries compete may have changing transmission regulatory structures, which could affect the ownership of these assets and related revenues and expenses. The traditional operating companies currently own and operate transmission facilities as part of a vertically integrated utility. Transmission revenues are not separated from generation and distribution revenues in their approved retail rates. Current FERC efforts that may potentially change the regulatory and/or operational structure of transmission include rules related to the standardization of generation interconnection, as well as an inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically integrated utilities. The financial condition, net income, and cash flows of Southern Company and its utility subsidiaries could be adversely affected by future changes in the federal regulatory or operational structure of transmission. Deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs which could negatively impact the net income of Southern Company and the traditional operating companies and the value of their respective assets. Increased competition resulting from restructuring efforts could have a significant adverse financial impact on Southern Company and the traditional operating companies. Any adoption in the territories served by the traditional I-16 Table of Contents operating companies of retail competition and the unbundling of regulated energy service could have a significant adverse financial impact on Southern Company and the traditional operating companies due to an impairment of assets, a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins, an inability to recover reasonable costs, or increased costs of capital. Southern Company and the traditional operating companies cannot predict if or when they may be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, nor can Southern Company and the traditional operating companies predict the impact of these changes. Additionally, the electric utility industry has experienced a substantial increase in competition at the wholesale level. As a result of changes in federal law and regulatory policy, competition in the wholesale electricity market has greatly increased due to a greater participation by traditional electricity suppliers, non-utility generators, IPPs, wholesale power marketers, and brokers and due to the trading of energy futures contracts on various commodities exchanges. In addition, FERC rules on transmission service are designed to facilitate competition in the wholesale market on a nationwide basis by providing greater flexibility and more choices to wholesale power customers. Changes to the criteria used by the FERC for approval of market-based rate authority may negatively impact the traditional operating companies and Southern Powers ability to charge market-based rates which could negatively impact the net income and cash flow of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power. Each of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power have authorization from the FERC to sell power to nonaffiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based sale to an affiliate. In 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Companys generation dominance within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by any subsidiary of Southern Company in Southern Companys retail service territory entered into during a 15-month refund period that ended in May 2006 could be subject to refund to a cost-based rate level. In November 2007, the presiding administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the methodology to be used in the generation dominance tests. The proceedings are ongoing. The ultimate outcome of this generation dominance proceeding cannot now be determined, but an adverse decision by the FERC in a final order could require the traditional operating companies and Southern Power to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates, and could also result in total refunds of up to $19.7 million, plus interest. Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe that there is no meritorious basis for an adverse decision in this proceeding and are vigorously defending themselves in this matter. In June 2007, the FERC issued its final rule in Order No. 697 regarding market-based rate authority. The FERC generally retained its current market-based rate standards. Responding to a number of requests for rehearing, the FERC issued Order No. 697-A on April 21, 2008 and Order No. 697-B on December 12, 2008. These orders largely affirmed the FERCs prior revision and codification of the regulations governing market-based rates for public utilities. In accordance with the orders, Southern Company submitted to the FERC an updated market power analysis on September 2, 2008 related to its continued market-based rate authority. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now be determined. On October 17, 2008, Southern Company filed with the FERC a revised market-based rate (MBR) tariff and a new cost-based rate (CBR) tariff. The revised MBR tariff provides for a must offer energy auction whereby Southern Company offers all of its available energy for sale in a day-ahead auction and an hour-ahead auction with reserve prices not to exceed the CBR tariff price, after considering Southern Companys native load requirements, reliability obligations, and sales commitments to third parties. All sales under the energy auction would be at market clearing prices established under the auction rules. The new CBR tariff provides for a cost-based price for wholesale sales of less than a year. On December 18, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the MBR tariff subject to certain revisions to the auction proposal. On January 21, 2009, Southern Company made a compliance filing that accepted all the conditions of the MBR tariff order. When this order becomes final, Southern Company will have 30 days to implement the wholesale auction. On December 31, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting I-17 Table of Contents the CBR tariff subject to providing additional information. On January 30, 2009, Southern Company filed a response addressing the FERC inquiry to the CBR tariff order. Implementation of the energy auction in accordance with the MBR tariff order is expected to adequately mitigate going forward any presumption of market power that Southern Company may have in the Southern Company retail service territory. The timing of when the FERC may issue final orders on the MBR and CBR tariffs and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. Risks Related to Southern Company and its Business Southern Company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to Southern Company. Southern Company is a holding company and, as such, Southern Company has no operations of its own. Substantially all of Southern Companys consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries. Southern Companys ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to Southern Company. Prior to funding Southern Company, Southern Companys subsidiaries have financial obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends. Southern Companys subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide Southern Company with funds for its payment obligations. The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if they are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions. The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of its subsidiaries electric generating, transmission, and distribution facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:  operator error or failure of equipment or processes;  operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;  labor disputes;  terrorist attacks;  fuel or material supply interruptions;  compliance with mandatory reliability standards;  information technology system failure; and  catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, droughts, hurricanes, pandemic health events such as an avian influenza, or other similar occurrences. A decrease or elimination of revenues from the electric generation, transmission, or distribution facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities would reduce the net income and cash flows and could adversely impact the financial condition of the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company. The traditional operating companies could be subject to higher costs and penalties as a result of mandatory reliability standards. As a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, owners and operators of bulk power transmission systems, including the traditional operating companies, are subject to mandatory reliability standards enacted by the North American I-18 Table of Contents Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC. Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject the traditional operating companies and Southern Company to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures. If any traditional operating company is found to be in noncompliance with the mandatory reliability standards, the traditional operating company could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties. The revenues of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power depend in part on sales under PPAs. The failure of a counterparty to one of these PPAs to perform its obligations, or the failure to renew the PPAs, could have a negative impact on the net income and cash flows of the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company. Most of Southern Powers generating capacity has been sold to purchasers under PPAs. In addition, the traditional operating companies enter into PPAs with non-affiliated parties. Revenues are dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of their obligations under these PPAs. Even though Southern Power and the traditional operating companies have a rigorous credit evaluation process, the failure of one of the purchasers to perform its obligations could have a negative impact on the net income and cash flows of the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company. Although these credit evaluations take into account the possibility of default by a purchaser, actual exposure to a default by a purchaser may be greater than the credit evaluation predicts. Additionally, neither Southern Power nor any traditional operating company can predict whether the PPAs will be renewed at the end of their respective terms or on what terms any renewals may be made. If a PPA is not renewed, a replacement PPA cannot be assured. Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power may incur additional costs or delays in the construction of new plants or other facilities and may not be able to recover their investment. The facilities of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power require ongoing capital expenditures. The businesses of the registrants require substantial capital expenditures for investments in new facilities and capital improvements to transmission, distribution, and generation facilities, including those to meet environmental standards. Certain of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power are in the process of constructing new generating facilities and adding environmental controls equipment at existing generating facilities. Southern Company intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing other new facilities, including proposed new nuclear generating units and a proposed integrated coal gasification combined cycle facility, expanding existing facilities, and adding environmental control equipment. These types of projects are long-term in nature and may involve facility designs that have not been finalized or previously constructed. The completion of these types of projects without delays or cost overruns is subject to substantial risks, including:  shortages and inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor;  work stoppages;  contractor or supplier non-performance under construction or other agreements;  delays in or failure to receive necessary permits, approvals, and other regulatory authorizations;  impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations;  adverse weather conditions;  unforeseen engineering problems;  changes in project design or scope;  environmental and geological conditions; I-19 Table of Contents  delays or increased costs to interconnect facilities to transmission grids;  unanticipated cost increases, including materials and labor; and  attention to other projects. If a traditional operating company or Southern Power is unable to complete the development or construction of a facility or decides to delay or cancel construction of a facility, it may not be able to recover its investment in that facility and may incur substantial cancellation payments under equipment purchase orders or construction contracts. Even if a construction project is completed, the total costs may be higher than estimated and there is no assurance that the traditional operating company will be able to recover such expenditures through regulated rates. In addition, construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls can result in the loss of revenues and may, in turn, adversely affect the net income and financial position of a traditional operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company. Furthermore, if construction projects are not completed according to specification, a traditional operating company or Southern Power and Southern Company may incur liabilities and suffer reduced plant efficiency, higher operating costs, and reduced net income. Once facilities come into commercial operation, ongoing capital expenditures are required to maintain reliable levels of operation. Significant portions of the traditional operating companies existing facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generation equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures to maintain efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to provide reliable operations. Changes in technology may make Southern Companys electric generating facilities owned by the traditional operating companies and Southern Power less competitive. A key element of the business model of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power is that generating power at central station power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive cost. There are distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, and solar cells. It is possible that advances in technology will reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most central station power electric production. If this were to happen and if these technologies achieved economies of scale, the market share of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power could be eroded, and the value of their respective electric generating facilities could be reduced. It is also possible that rapid advances in central station power generation technology could reduce the value of the current electric generating facilities owned by Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power. Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize power, which could reduce the revenues or increase the expenses of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power. Operation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, health, regulatory, terrorism, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of Southern Companys nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage. Alabama Power owns two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for operation of, four nuclear units. These six units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represent approximately 3,680 megawatts, or 8.6%, of Southern Companys generation capacity as of December 31, 2008. These nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, health, and financial risks such as on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities, and the threat of a possible terrorist attack. Alabama Power and Georgia Power maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks; however, it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines I-20 Table of Contents or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Company have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at their plants, if an incident did occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit. In addition, potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of utilities could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult or impossible to predict. The generation operations and energy marketing operations of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to risks, many of which are beyond their control, including changes in power prices and fuel costs, that may reduce Southern Companys, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Powers revenues and increase costs. The generation operations and energy marketing operations of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to changes in power prices or fuel costs, which could increase the cost of producing power or decrease the amount Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power receive from the sale of power. The market prices for these commodities may fluctuate significantly over relatively short periods of time. Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power attempt to mitigate risks associated with fluctuating fuel costs by passing these costs on to customers through the traditional operating companies fuel cost recovery clauses or through PPAs. Among the factors that could influence power prices and fuel costs are:  prevailing market prices for coal, natural gas, uranium, fuel oil, and other fuels used in the generation facilities of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities;  demand for energy and the extent of additional supplies of energy available from current or new competitors;  liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market;  weather conditions impacting demand for electricity;  seasonality;  transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies;  availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources;  forced or unscheduled plant outages for the Southern Company system, its competitors, or third party providers;  the financial condition of market participants;  the economy in the service territory, the nation, and worldwide, including the impact of economic conditions on industrial and commercial demand for electricity and the worldwide demand for fuels;  natural disasters, wars, embargos, acts of terrorism, and other catastrophic events; and  federal, state, and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation. Certain of these factors could increase the expenses of the traditional operating companies or Southern Power and I-21 Table of Contents Southern Company. For the traditional operating companies, such increases may not be fully recoverable through rates. Other of these factors could reduce the revenues of the traditional operating companies or Southern Power and Southern Company. The traditional operating companies have experienced underrecovered fuel cost balances and deficits in their storm cost recovery reserve balances and may continue to experience such balances in the future. While the traditional operating companies are generally authorized to recover underrecovered fuel costs through fuel cost recovery clauses and storm recovery costs through special rate provisions administered by the respective PSCs, recovery may be denied if costs are deemed to be imprudently incurred and delays in the authorization of such recovery could negatively impact the cash flows of the affected traditional operating company and Southern Company. The use of derivative contracts by Southern Company and its subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in financial losses that negatively impact the net income of Southern Company and its subsidiaries. Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards, to manage their commodity and interest rate risks and, to a lesser extent, engage in limited trading activities. Southern Company and its subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve managements judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the value of the reported fair value of these contracts. The traditional operating companies and Southern Power may not be able to obtain adequate fuel supplies, which could limit their ability to operate their facilities. The traditional operating companies and Southern Power purchase fuel, including coal, natural gas, uranium, and fuel oil, from a number of suppliers. Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of, among other things, transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events, or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, could limit the ability of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power to operate their respective facilities, and thus reduce the net income of the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and Southern Company. The traditional operating companies are dependent on coal for much of their electric generating capacity. Each traditional operating company has coal supply contracts in place; however, there can be no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply coal to the traditional operating companies. The suppliers under these agreements may experience financial or technical problems which inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to the traditional operating companies. In addition, the suppliers under these agreements may not be required to supply coal to the traditional operating companies under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If the traditional operating companies are unable to obtain their coal requirements under these contracts, the traditional operating companies may be required to purchase their coal requirements at higher prices, which may not be fully recoverable through rates. In addition, Southern Power in particular, and the traditional operating companies to a lesser extent, are dependent on natural gas for a portion of their electric generating capacity. Natural gas supplies can be subject to disruption in the event production or distribution is curtailed, such as in the event of a hurricane. In addition, world market conditions for fuels can impact the availability of natural gas, coal, and uranium. Demand for power could exceed supply capacity, resulting in increased costs for purchasing capacity in the open market or building additional generation capabilities. Through the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, Southern Company is currently obligated to supply power to retail customers and wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At peak times, the demand for power required to meet this obligation could exceed Southern Companys available generation capacity. Market or I-22 Table of Contents competitive forces may require that the traditional operating companies or Southern Power purchase capacity on the open market or build additional generation capabilities. Because regulators may not permit the traditional operating companies to pass all of these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the traditional operating companies may not be able to recover any of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of purchased or constructed capacity and the traditional operating companies recovery in customers rates. Under Southern Powers long-term fixed price PPAs, Southern Power would not have the ability to recover any of these costs. These situations could have negative impacts on net income and cash flows for the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and Southern Company. Demand for power could decrease or fail to grow at expected rates, resulting in stagnant or reduced revenues, limited growth opportunities, and potentially stranded generation assets. Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power collectively engage in a long-term planning process to determine the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations. This planning process must look many years into the future in order to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation facilities. Inherent risk exists in predicting demand this far into the future as these future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including regional economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption. Because regulators may not permit the traditional operating companies to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation assets while such assets are being constructed, the traditional operating companies may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of additional capacity and the traditional operating companies recovery in customers rates. Under Southern Powers model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. Southern Power may not be able to extend its existing PPAs or to find new buyers for existing generation assets as existing PPAs expire, or it may be forced to market these assets at prices lower than originally intended. These situations could have negative impacts on net income and cash flows for the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and Southern Company. The operating results of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. Electric power supply is generally a seasonal business. In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power have historically sold less power when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce the revenues, net income, available cash, and borrowing ability of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power. Mirant and The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Mirant Corporation have filed a claim against Southern Company seeking substantial monetary damages in connection with transfers made by Mirant to Southern Company prior to the Mirant spin-off. An adverse outcome of this litigation could negatively impact the net income and cash flows of Southern Company. Mirant was an energy company with businesses that included independent power projects and energy trading and risk management companies in the U.S. and selected other countries. It was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company until its initial public offering in October 2000. In April 2001, Southern Company completed a spin-off to its shareholders of its remaining ownership, and Mirant became an independent corporate entity. In July 2003, Mirant and certain of its affiliates filed for voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. In January 2006, Mirants plan of reorganization became effective, and Mirant emerged from bankruptcy. As part of the plan, Mirant transferred substantially all of its assets and its restructured debt to a new corporation that adopted the name Mirant Corporation (Reorganized Mirant). I-23 Table of Contents In December 2004, as a result of concluding an IRS audit for the tax years 2000 and 2001, Southern Company paid approximately $39 million in additional tax and interest related to Mirant tax items and filed a claim in Mirants bankruptcy case for that amount. Through December 2008, Southern Company received from the IRS approximately $38 million in refunds related to Mirant. Southern Company believes it has a right to recoup the $39 million tax payment owed by Mirant from such tax refunds. As a result, Southern Company intends to retain the tax refunds and reduce its claim against Mirant for the payment of Mirant taxes by the amount of such refunds. MC Asset Recovery, a special purpose subsidiary of Reorganized Mirant, has objected to and sought to equitably subordinate the Southern Company tax claim in its fraudulent transfer litigation against Southern Company. Southern Company has reserved the remaining amount with respect to its Mirant tax claim. If Southern Company is ultimately required to make any additional payments either with respect to the IRS audit or its contingent obligations under guarantees of Mirant subsidiaries, Mirants indemnification obligation to Southern Company for these additional payments, if allowed, would constitute unsecured claims against Mirant, entitled to stock in Reorganized Mirant. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined. In June 2005, Mirant, as a debtor in possession, and The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Mirant Corporation filed a complaint against Southern Company in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, which was amended in July 2005, February 2006, May 2006, and March 2007. In January 2006, MC Asset Recovery was substituted as plaintiff. The fourth amended complaint (the complaint) alleges that Southern Company caused Mirant to engage in certain fraudulent transfers and to pay illegal dividends to Southern Company prior to the spin-off. The complaint also seeks to recharacterize certain advances from Southern Company to Mirant for investments in energy facilities from debt to equity. The complaint further alleges that Southern Company is liable to Mirants creditors for the full amount of Mirants liability under an alter ego theory of recovery and that Southern Company breached its fiduciary duties to Mirant and its creditors, caused Mirant to breach its fiduciary duties to creditors, and aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary duties by Mirants directors and officers. The complaint also seeks recoveries under the theories of restitution and unjust enrichment. In addition, the complaint alleged a claim under the Federal Debt Collection Procedure Act (FDCPA) to avoid certain transfers from Mirant to Southern Company; however, on July 7, 2008, the court ruled that the FDCPA does not apply and that Georgia law should apply instead. The complaint seeks monetary damages in excess of $2 billion plus interest, punitive damages, attorneys fees, and costs. Finally, the complaint includes an objection to Southern Companys pending claims against Mirant in the Bankruptcy Court (which relate to reimbursement under the separation agreements of payments such as income taxes, interest, legal fees, and other guarantees described in Note 7 to the financial statements of Southern Company in Item 8 herein) and seeks equitable subordination of Southern Companys claims to the claims of all other creditors. Southern Company served an answer to the complaint in April 2007. In February 2006, the Companys motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia was granted. In May 2006, Southern Company filed a motion for summary judgment seeking entry of judgment against the plaintiff as to all counts in the complaint. In December 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia granted in part and denied in part the motion. As a result, certain breach of fiduciary duty claims alleged in earlier versions of the complaint were barred; all other claims were allowed to proceed. On August 6, 2008, Southern Company filed a second motion for summary judgment. MC Asset Recovery filed its response to Southern Companys motion for summary judgment on October 20, 2008. On February 5, 2009, the court denied Southern Companys summary judgment motion in connection with the fraudulent conveyance and illegal dividend claims concerning certain advance return/loan repayments in 1999, dividends in 1999 and 2000, and transfers in connection with Mirants separation from Southern Company. The court granted the motion with respect to certain claims, including claims for restitution and unjust enrichment, claims that Southern Company aided and abetted Mirants directors breach of fiduciary duties to Mirant, and claims that Southern Company used Mirant as an alter ego. In addition, the court granted Southern Companys motion in connection with the fraudulent transfer and illegal dividend claims concerning certain turbine termination payments. Southern Company believes there is no meritorious basis for the claims in the complaint and is vigorously defending itself in this action. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under Mirant Matters  MC Asset Recovery Litigation in Item 8 herein. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot now be determined at this time. I-24 Table of Contents Risks Related to Market and Economic Volatility The business of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power is dependent on their ability to successfully access funds through capital markets and financial institutions. The inability of Southern Company, any traditional operating company, or Southern Power to access funds may limit its ability to execute its business plan by impacting its ability to fund capital investments or acquisitions that Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash flows. Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power rely on access to both short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their respective operations. If Southern Company, any traditional operating company, or Southern Power is not able to access capital at competitive rates, its ability to implement its business plan will be limited by impacting its ability to fund capital investments or acquisitions that Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash flows. In addition, Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power rely on committed bank lending agreements as back-up liquidity which allows them to access low cost money markets. Each of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power believes that it will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current credit ratings. However, certain market disruptions or a downgrade of the credit rating of Southern Company, any traditional operating company, or Southern Power may increase its cost of borrowing, adversely affect its ability to raise capital through the issuance of securities or other borrowing arrangements or its ability to secure committed bank lending agreements used as back-up sources of capital. Such disruptions could include:  an economic downturn or uncertainty;  the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company or financial institution;  capital markets volatility and interruption;  financial institution distress;  market prices for electricity and gas;  terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on Southern Companys facilities or unrelated energy companies facilities;  war or threat of war; or  the overall health of the utility and financial institution industries. Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plans and decommissioning trust assets, which then could require significant additional funding. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Southern Companys pension and postretirement benefit plans and the assets held in trust to satisfy obligations to decommission Alabama Powers and Georgia Powers nuclear plants. Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below projected return rates. A decline in the market value of these assets, as has been experienced in prior periods, may increase the funding requirements relating to Southern Companys benefit plan liabilities and Alabama Powers and Georgia Powers decommissioning obligations. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Southern Companys pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans. If Southern Company is unable to successfully manage benefit plan assets and Alabama Power and Georgia I-25 Table of Contents Power are unable to successfully manage the decommissioning trust funds, results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected. Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to risks associated with a changing economic environment, which could impact their ability to obtain adequate insurance and the financial stability of the customers of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power. The financial condition of some insurance companies, the threat of terrorism, and the hurricanes that affected the Gulf Coast, among other things, have had disruptive effects on the insurance industry. The availability of insurance covering risks that Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and their respective competitors typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance that Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms. Additionally, any economic downturn or disruption of financial markets could negatively affect the financial stability of the customers and counterparties of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power. These factors could adversely affect Southern Companys subsidiaries ability to maintain energy sales, thereby decreasing Southern Companys level of future net income. Certain of the traditional operating companies have substantial investments in the Atlantic or Gulf Coast regions which can be subject to major storm activity. The ability of the traditional operating companies to recover costs and replenish reserves in the event of a major storm, other natural disaster, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event generally will require regulatory action. Each traditional operating company maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of uninsured damages to its generating facilities and other property. In the event a traditional operating company experiences a natural disaster, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event, recovery of costs in excess of reserves and insurance coverage is subject to the approval of its state PSC. While the traditional operating companies generally are entitled to recover prudently incurred costs incurred in connection with such an event, any denial by the applicable state PSC or delay in recovery of any portion of such costs could have a material negative impact on a traditional operating companys and Southern Companys results of operations and/or cash flows.
