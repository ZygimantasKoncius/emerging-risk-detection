ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. You should carefully consider the following risks and any of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the documents incorporated herein by reference, before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. The following risks, among others, could cause our actual results, performance, achievements or industry results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements contained herein and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed. In such case, the market price of our common stock would likely decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment. We may fail in the development and commercialization of our products. Although we have regulatory clearance to market SURFAXIN® and AFECTAIR®, they are not currently available for sale and we have no other products approved for marketing. We are implementing a plan intended to result in the commercial introduction of SURFAXIN and AFECTAIR in late 2012. We are conducting research and development on our other product candidates. As a result, we have not begun to market or generate revenues from the commercialization of any of our products. 32 Table of Contents We may experience a delay in, or be unable to achieve, the commercial introduction of, SURFAXIN and AFECTAIR in the United States and other markets as planned, or we may not successfully develop and market our other KL4 surfactant and aerosol delivery pipeline products. Our long-term viability will be impaired if we experience a significant delay or failure to successfully commercialize our approved products or obtain regulatory approval for and successfully market, our product candidates. Even if we successfully develop and gain regulatory approval for our products, we still may not generate sufficient or sustainable revenues or we may not become profitable, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our marketing and distribution efforts, research and development programs and operations. We will require significant additional capital to continue our planned research and development activities and continue our operations. Moreover, such additional financing could result in equity dilution. Until we are able to generate sufficient revenues from the sale of SURFAXIN and AFECTAIR, we will need substantial additional funding to support our commercial operations and our ongoing research and development activities and our operations. Our current plans are to focus our resources on our lead drug product and device development programs, SURFAXIN LS™ and AEROSURF®, and on being in a position to initiate key clinical programs after we have secured the necessary capital. We would prefer to accomplish our objectives through strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements. If we are unable to raise substantial additional funds through strategic alliances or other alternatives, including potentially future debt and equity financings, we may be forced to further limit investments in our development programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In the meantime, as we continue to conserve our financial resources, we will likely experience additional delays in our development programs. As of December 31, 2011, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $397.4 million and we expect to continue to incur significant, increasing operating losses over the next several years. To date, we have generated capital to support our activities primarily from equity financings, research grants, collaboration agreements, and investments. As of December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10.2 million. In the first quarter 2012, we received net proceeds of approximately $50.3 million from financings and the exercise of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. We expect our cash outflows in 2012 to increase as we invest in our commercial and medical affairs organization and prepare for the commercial introduction of our approved products. Our ability to fund our research and development activities in the future is dependent upon our ability to generate revenues from the sale of approved products and raise additional capital to fund our research and development and commercial programs and meet our obligations on a timely basis. We are seeking strategic alliances to support the development of SURFAXIN LS and AEROSURF and, if approved, to commercialize these product candidates in the European Union and other markets outside the United States. Even if we are successful in generating revenues from the sale of approved products, we will likely not have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to fund our research and development programs, and will require additional capital through strategic alliances and other financing alternatives. If we are unable to successfully raise the necessary additional capital, we will likely not have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to fund our research and development programs, which will force us to curtail our activities and, ultimately, potentially cease operations. Even if we are able to raise additional capital, such financings may only be available on unattractive terms, or could result in significant dilution of stockholders’ interests and, in such event, the market price of our common stock may decline. In addition, depending on conditions in the global financial markets, we may face significant challenges accessing the capital markets at a time when we would like or require, and at an increased cost of capital. Except for our CEFF and our ATM Program (which are subject to certain limitations), we currently do not have arrangements to obtain additional financing. Any such financing could be difficult to obtain or only available on unattractive terms and could result in significant dilution of stockholders’ interests. In any such event, the market price of our common stock may decline. In addition, failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business plan, financial performance and stock price and could delay new product development and clinical trial plans. To support the commercialization of SURFAXIN® and AFECTAIR®, we plan to establish our own commercial and medical affairs organization, enter into distribution arrangements and, in markets outside the United States, seek one or more strategic alliances to support the development and, if approved, commercialization of our KL4 surfactant products and AFECTAIR devices. If we enter into distributor arrangements or strategic alliances, we may be required to transfer rights to our products and will be exposed to risks associated with the transfer of control to third parties. 33 Table of Contents To support the commercial introduction of SURFAXIN and AFECTAIR in the United States, we plan to establish our own commercial and medical affairs organization. In addition, we expect to enter into distribution and / or co-marketing arrangements to support the introduction of AFECTAIR in a broad range of critical care facilities, including in NICUs, PICUs and ICUs. In major markets outside the United States, we plan to seek one or more strategic alliances and/or collaboration arrangements potentially to share research and development expenses for our SURFAXIN LS and AEROSURF development programs, and, if approved, to support the commercial introduction of these products in Europe and elsewhere. We may also seek strategic alliances and/or collaboration arrangements to support the potential commercial introduction of SURFAXIN in countries where regulatory marketing authorization is facilitated by the recent approval of SURFAXIN by the FDA. We are engaged in discussions with potential strategic partners who could provide development and commercial expertise as well as financial resources (potentially in the form of upfront payments, milestone payments, commercialization royalties and a sharing of research and development expenses). We have also considered various other financial alternatives that could potentially provide infusions of capital and other resources needed to advance our KL4 surfactant pipeline programs meet our capital requirements and continue our operations. Although we continue to consider potential opportunities, there can be no assurance that any strategic alliance or other financing alternatives will be successfully concluded. We plan to continue assessing available opportunities with a view to maintaining and strengthening our financial and operational position. Moreover, consideration and planning of such strategic alliances diverts management’s attention and other resources from day-to-day operations, which may subject us to further risks and uncertainties. If we succeed in entering into one or more strategic alliances, our ability to execute our current operating plan will depend upon numerous factors, including, the performance of the strategic partners and collaborators with whom we may contract. Under these arrangements, our partners may control key decisions relating to the development, and assuming approval, commercialization, of our products. Such rights of our partners would limit our flexibility in considering development strategies and in commercializing our products. In addition, if we breach or terminate our strategic alliance agreements or if our strategic partners otherwise fail to conduct their activities in a timely manner, or if there is a dispute about our respective obligations, we may need to seek other partners or, in the alternative and after a potentially unacceptable delay, develop our own internal sales and marketing capabilities to commercialize our products in the United States. If we fail to successfully develop these relationships, or if we or our partners fail to successfully develop or commercialize any of our products, it may delay or prevent us from developing or commercializing our products in a competitive and timely manner and would have a material adverse effect on the commercialization of our products. For example, our collaboration arrangement with Esteve for SURFAXIN and certain other of our drug product candidates is focused on Andorra, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. We have limited influence over the decisions made by Esteve or its sublicensees or the resources that they may devote to the marketing and distribution of our KL4 surfactant products in their licensed territory, and Esteve or its sublicensees may not meet their obligations in this regard. Our marketing and distribution arrangement with Esteve may not be successful, and, as a result, we may not receive any revenues from it. In addition, we may not be able to enter into marketing and sales agreements for our KL4 surfactant pipeline products on acceptable terms, if at all, in territories not covered by the Esteve agreement, or for any of our other drug product candidates. If Esteve or we should fail to conduct our respective collaboration-related activities in a timely manner, or otherwise breach or terminate the agreements that make up our collaboration arrangements, or if a dispute should arise under our collaboration arrangements, such events could impair our ability to commercialize or develop our products for the Esteve territory in Europe. In that event, we may need to seek other partners and collaboration arrangement, or we may have to develop our own internal capabilities to market the covered products in the Esteve territory without a collaboration arrangement. We currently have limited expertise in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and limited marketing capabilities, which may restrict our success in commercializing our product candidates. To launch our drug product candidates in the United States, we plan to develop our own commercial and medical affairs capabilities, which could increase the cost to commercialize our products. We also plan to seek third-party distribution arrangements and marketing alliances, particularly to support the commercialization of AFECTAIR® in the United States and in markets outside the United States, which could require us to give up rights to our drug product candidates. 34 Table of Contents We have limited experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and have limited marketing capabilities. We plan to establish and primarily rely on own, in-house, specialty respiratory critical care commercial organization to market SURFAXIN, and, if approved, SURFAXIN LS and AEROSURF, in the United States. We expect that our commercial organization will also support the commercial introduction of AFECTAIR. Commercializing our drug product candidates in the United States on our own will likely cause our commercialization costs to increase, but will potentially avoid the transfer of rights to our products or drug product candidates. Developing an internal commercial and medical affairs capabilities is potentially a difficult, expensive and time-consuming process and requires a substantial capital investment. Recruiting, training and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success. Competition for such personnel can be intense, and we may be unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals to successfully support the launch and continued distribution of our products. We also may be unable to provide competitive incentives to retain our sales force. If we are unable to successfully attract and motivate a commercial team to support the introduction and sale of our products, we will have difficulty selling, maintaining and increasing the sales of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even with our own commercial organization to support the launch of SURFAXIN in the United States, we may also need to enter into co-marketing arrangements with third parties where our own personnel are neither well situated nor large enough to achieve maximum penetration in the market. In addition, we may seek strategic alliances and/or collaboration arrangements to support the potential commercial introduction of SURFAXIN in countries where regulatory marketing authorization is facilitated by the recent approval of SURFAXIN by the FDA. We may not be successful in entering into any co-marketing arrangements, and the terms of any co-marketing arrangements may not be favorable to us. In addition, if we enter into co-marketing arrangements or market and sell additional products directly, we may need to further expand our commercial staff and incur additional expense. We also plan to rely on third-party distributors to distribute, or enter into marketing alliances to sell, our AFECTAIR devices in the United States and internationally. We may not be successful in identifying such third parties or finalizing such arrangements on terms and conditions that are favorable to us and, as a result, we may not be able to commercialize our drug product candidates on a timely basis. If we are not successful in finalizing such arrangements, we may not have sufficient funds to successfully commercialize SURFAXIN or any other potential product in the United States or elsewhere. If we enter into distribution arrangements and marketing alliances to commercialize our drug product candidates, such arrangements will subject us to a number of risks, including: ● our distributors or collaborators may require that we transfer to them important rights to our products and/or drug product candidates; ● we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our distributors or collaborators devote to the commercialization of our products; ● if our distributors or collaborators fail to perform their obligations under our arrangements to our satisfaction, we may not achieve our projected sales and our revenues would suffer. We also may incur additional expense to terminate such arrangements and to identify and enter into arrangements with replacement distributors or collaborators; ● our distributors or collaborators may experience financial difficulties; and ● business combinations or significant changes in a collaborator’s business strategy may adversely affect a collaborator’s willingness or ability to perform its obligations under any arrangement, which would adversely affect our business. If we fail to enter into arrangements with third parties in a timely manner or if such parties fail to perform, it could adversely affect sales of our products. We and our third-party distributors and collaborators must also market our products in compliance with federal, state and local laws related to providing incentives and inducements. Violation of these laws can result in substantial penalties. If we fail to establish or secure commercial and medical affairs capabilities or fail to enter into arrangements with third parties in a timely manner or if such third parties fail to perform, it could adversely affect sales of our products. In addition, even if we establish or secure such capabilities, our third-party distributors and we must also market our products in compliance with federal, state and local laws relating to the restrictions on incentives and inducements. Violation of these laws can result in substantial penalties. If we are unable to successfully motivate our sales force, or if our distributors fail to promote our products, we will have difficulty maintaining and increasing the sales of our products. 35 Table of Contents The commercial success of our product candidates will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payers and others in the medical community. Any products that we bring to market, including SURFAXIN and AFECTAIR, may not gain or maintain market acceptance by governmental purchasers, group purchasing organizations, physicians, patients, healthcare payers and others in the medical community. If any products that we develop do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate sufficient revenues to support continued commercialization of these products. The degree of market acceptance of SURFAXIN and AFECTAIR and our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including: ● the perceived safety and efficacy of our products; ● the potential advantages over alternative treatments; ● the prevalence and severity of any side effects; ● the relative convenience and ease of administration; ● cost effectiveness; ● our ability to gain access to the entire market through our distributor arrangements; ● the rate of preterm births; ● the willingness of the target patient population to try new products and of physicians to prescribe our products; ● the willingness of the target hospitals to accept and employ the WARMING CRADLE ● the effectiveness of our marketing strategy and distribution support; and ● the sufficiency of coverage or reimbursement by third parties. If our business development activities are unsuccessful, our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected. As part of our long-term growth strategy, we are engaged in business development activities intended to develop strategic opportunities, including potential strategic alliances, joint development opportunities, acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. Such opportunities may result in substantial investments. Our success in developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for investment, alliance or acquisition; whether we are able to complete an investment, alliance or acquisition on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of our underlying technology, products and our ability to execute our business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology; and our ability to successfully execute the investment, alliance or acquisition into our existing operations, including to fund our share of any in-process research and development projects. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected. Our activities are subject to various and complex laws and regulations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment. Any failure to comply could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our products and our operations are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. Our drug product candidates and medical devices must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Our facilities and those of our third-party providers must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection at any time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of our products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our sales. In addition, requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities may change; implementing additional compliance requirements may increase our costs, or force us or our third-party providers to suspend production, which could result in a shortage of our approved product or delays in the commercial introduction of our new product candidates, if approved. 36 Table of Contents The sales and marketing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increasing scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. The FDA and other federal regulators have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, off-label promotion of products, other healthcare related laws, antitrust and other competition laws. The Department of Justice (DOJ) also has increased its focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers. The laws and standards governing the promotion, sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. We are developing compliance programs, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to address these risks. However, these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees, well meaning or otherwise, that violate these laws. Violations or allegations of violations, of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The regulatory approval process for our products is expensive and time-consuming and the outcome is uncertain. We may not obtain required regulatory approvals to commercialize our products. To test, make and sell our products under development, we must receive regulatory approvals for each product. The FDA and foreign regulators, such as the EMA, extensively and rigorously regulate the testing, manufacture, distribution, advertising, pricing and marketing of drug products. This approval process includes (i) preclinical studies and clinical trials of each drug product candidate and active pharmaceutical ingredient to establish its safety and effectiveness, and (ii) confirmation by the FDA and foreign regulators that we maintain good laboratory and manufacturing practices during testing and manufacturing. Even if favorable data are generated by clinical trials, the FDA or foreign regulator may not accept or approve an NDA or MAA filed for a drug product on a timely basis or at all. See, “Item 1 – Business – Government Regulation.” In particular, we filed with the FDA an NDA for SURFAXIN for the prevention of RDS in premature infants. We received the 2009 Complete Response Letter for this NDA. Following a number of exchanges with the FDA, we conducted a comprehensive preclinical program that consisted of a series of prospectively-designed, side-by-side preclinical studies employing our optimized BAT and the well-established preterm lamb model of RDS. These time-consuming studies were intended to demonstrate comparability of drug product used in the Phase 3 clinical program with SURFAXIN drug product to be manufactured for commercial use, and to gain the FDA’s agreement on final acceptance criteria, with respect to biological activity as assessed by the BAT, for release and ongoing stability of SURFAXIN drug product. See, “Item 1 – Business – Surfactant Replacement Therapy for Respiratory Medicine – Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Premature Infants (RDS) – SURFAXIN for the Prevention of RDS in Premature Infants at High Risk for RDS.” To gain approval of SURFAXIN LS and AEROSURF, we expect to conduct a clinical program and are working to be in a position to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for AEROSURF and a Phase 3 clinical trial for SURFAXIN LS in late 2013. We believe that our success in gaining approval for SURFAXIN in the United States may facilitate our efforts to gain regulatory approval for SURFAXIN LS and AEROSURF. However, there can be no assurance that issues requiring protracted and time-consuming preclinical studies will not arise. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in gaining regulatory approval for SURFAXIN LS and / or AEROSURF, if at all, within our expected time frame. If we choose to pursue clinical development and commercialization in the European Union or otherwise market and sell our products outside of the United States, we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and comply with regulatory requirements in such jurisdictions. The approval procedures vary among countries in complexity and timing. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all, which would preclude us from commercializing products in those markets. In addition, some countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, regulate the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In these countries, pricing discussions with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of their product candidate to other available therapies. Such trials may be time-consuming and expensive, and may not show an advantage in efficacy for our products. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, in either the United States or the European Union, we could be adversely affected. 37 Table of Contents Even assuming that we have gained regulatory approval to market our drugs, if the FDA and foreign regulators later withdraw their approval or otherwise restrict marketing, our business would be materially harmed. The FDA has approved SURFAXIN for marketing in the United States. Our development programs for SURFAXIN LS and AEROSURF are in the preclinical stage, with clinical trials potentially anticipated in late 2013. Foreign regulators have not yet approved any of our products under development for marketing. Without regulatory approval, we will not be able to market these products. Even if we were to succeed in gaining regulatory approvals for any of our products, the FDA or a foreign regulator could at any time withdraw any approvals granted if there is a later discovery of previously unidentified problems or if we fail to comply with other applicable regulatory requirements at any stage in the regulatory process, or the FDA or a foreign regulator may restrict or delay our marketing of a product, including by requiring us to include warnings and other restrictions in the package inserts for our products, or force us to make product recalls. In addition, the FDA could impose other sanctions such as fines, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecutions. Any withdrawal of our regulatory approval or significant restriction on our ability to market our products after approval would have a material adverse effect on our business. Even though some of our product candidates have qualified for expedited review, the FDA may not approve them at all or any sooner than other product candidates that do not qualify for expedited review. The FDA has notified us that two indications of our KL4 surfactant technology pipeline, BPD in premature infants and ARDS in adults, have been granted designation as “Fast Track” products under provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997. We believe that other potential products in our KL4 surfactant technology pipeline may also qualify for Fast Track designation. Fast Track designation does not accelerate clinical trials nor does it mean that the regulatory requirements are less stringent. Our products may cease to qualify for expedited review and our other product candidates may fail to qualify for Fast Track designation or expedited review. Moreover, even if we are successful in gaining Fast Track designation, other factors could result in significant delays in our development activities with respect to our Fast Track products. Our continuing research and development KL4 surfactant programs for SURFAXIN LS™ and AEROSURF® involve significant risks and uncertainties that are inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval processes. Development risk factors include, but are not limited to, whether we, or our third-party collaborators, drug substances and materials suppliers and third-party contract manufacturers, will be able to: ● complete our preclinical and clinical trials of our KL4 surfactant product candidates with scientific results that are sufficient to support further development and regulatory approval; ● receive the necessary regulatory approvals; ● obtain adequate supplies of surfactant active drug substances, manufactured to our specifications and on commercially reasonable terms; ● perform under agreements to supply drug substances, medical devices and related components and related services necessary to manufacture our KL4 surfactant product candidates; ● provide for sufficient manufacturing capabilities, at our manufacturing operations in Totowa and with third-party contract manufacturers, to produce sufficient drug product, including for SURFAXIN-related studies, SURFAXIN LS and AEROSURF, and CAG devices and related materials to meet our preclinical and clinical development requirements; ● obtain the capital necessary to fund our research and development efforts, including our business administration, preclinical and clinical organizations, and our quality and manufacturing operations. 38 Table of Contents Because these factors, many of which are outside our control, could have a potentially significant impact on our development activities, the success, timing of completion and ultimate cost of development of any of our product candidates is highly uncertain and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty. The timing and cost to complete drug trials alone may be impacted by, among other things: ● slow patient enrollment; ● long treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness; ● lack of sufficient clinical supplies and material; ● adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients; ● lack of compatibility with complementary technologies; ● failure of a drug product candidate to demonstrate effectiveness; and ● lack of sufficient funds. If we do not successfully complete clinical trials, we will not receive regulatory approval to market our KL4 surfactant pipeline products. Failure to obtain and maintain regulatory approval and generate revenues from the sale of our products would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and likely reduce the market value of our common stock. Our clinical trials may be delayed, or fail, which will harm our business. We have completed our Phase 3 clinical trials for SURFAXIN for the prevention of RDS in premature infants and certain Phase 2 trials for other drug product candidates for other indications. If we successfully advance our other KL4 surfactant development programs, SURFAXIN LS and AEROSURF, through the initial preclinical phase of development, we plan to conduct Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 clinical trials, potentially beginning in late 2013. However, before we will initiate a clinical program, we will have to secure adequate capital to support that activity. Such clinical trials generally take two to five years or more to complete and may be delayed by a number of factors. We may not reach agreement with the FDA or a foreign regulator on the design of any one or more of the clinical studies necessary for approval. Conditions imposed by the FDA and foreign regulators on our clinical trials could significantly increase the time required for completion of such clinical trials and the costs of conducting the clinical trials. Like many biotechnology companies, even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials or in preliminary findings for such clinical trials, we may suffer significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, we may be unable to enroll patients quickly enough to meet our expectations for completing any or all of these trials. The timing and completion of current and planned clinical trials of our product candidates depend on many factors, including the rate at which patients are enrolled. Delays in patient enrollment in clinical trials may occur, which would be likely to result in increased costs, program delays, or both. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including: ● the number of clinical sites; ● the size of the patient population; ● the proximity of patients to the clinical sites; ● the eligibility and enrollment criteria for the study; ● the willingness of patients or their parents or guardians to participate in the clinical trial; ● the existence of competing clinical trials; ● the existence of alternative available products; and ● geographical and geopolitical considerations. If we succeed in achieving our patient enrollment targets, patients that enroll in our clinical trials could suffer adverse medical events or side effects that are known, such as a decrease in the oxygen level of the blood upon administration, or currently unknown to us. It is also possible that we, our Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), the FDA or foreign regulators could interrupt, delay or halt any one or more of our clinical trials for any of our product candidates. If our SAB, the DSMC, any regulator or we believe that trial participants face unacceptable health risks, any one or more of our trials could be suspended or terminated. In addition, clinical trials may be interrupted, delayed or halted, in whole or in part, for reasons other than health and safety concerns, including, among other things, matters related to the design of the study, drug availability, SAB and/or DSMC recommendation, or business reasons. 39 Table of Contents In addition to our planned clinical programs to support SURFAXIN LS and AEROSURF, we also may initiate or support clinical studies evaluating other KL4 surfactant pipeline products. All of these clinical trials will be time-consuming and potentially costly. Should we fail to complete our clinical development programs or should such programs yield unacceptable results, such failures would have a material adverse effect on our business. Marketing authorization to promote, manufacture and/or sell AFECTAIR® will be limited and subject to continuing review. We have successfully registered our initial AFECTAIR in the United States. We expect to register this device in the European Union in 2012. Even if regulatory clearance of this product is granted in the European Union, or if regulatory clearance of any subsequent AFECTAIR device is granted, such clearance will be subject to limitations on the intended uses for which the product may be marketed and reduce our potential to successfully commercialize the product and generate revenue from the product. The FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label uses and the promotion of products for which marketing clearance has not been obtained. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, labeling, training or other marketing or educational activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we cease or modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to serious regulatory enforcement actions, including some of those listed above. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities will take action if they consider our training or other promotional materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. A company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions. Due to these legal constraints, our distributors’ sales and marketing efforts will focus only on the general technical attributes and benefits of AFECTAIR and the FDA cleared indications for use. We plan to conduct a series of studies evaluating the utility of AFECTAIR in delivering specific inhaled therapies, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful, or even if successful, that we will be able to expand our label to include the additional indications. In addition, we may be required to conduct costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of AFECTAIR, and we must comply with medical device reporting requirements, including the reporting of adverse events and malfunctions related to our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with AFECTAIR, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market or regulatory enforcement actions. Failure to complete the development of our CAG device and related componentry in a timely manner, if at all, would have a material adverse effect on our efforts to develop AEROSURF®, our other aerosolized KL4 surfactant products, and our business strategy. Since early 2008, we have been responsible for development of our proprietary CAG technology, including finalizing the design of an optimized CAG device that is suitable for use in our planned Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. Our development activities are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: ● We may not successfully develop a CAG device that is suitable for use in a clinical environment, if at all, on a timely basis and such inability may delay or prevent initiation of our planned clinical trials. ● We will require access to sophisticated engineering capabilities. We have medical device engineering staff with industry experience in developing medical devices, and plan to work with leading medical device development engineers and medical device design experts that have a successful track record of developing innovative devices for the medical and pharmaceutical industries. If we are unable to identify design engineers and medical device experts to support our development efforts, including for a clinic-ready CAG system for use in our planned clinical trials and, potentially, for later versions of the CAG systems, it would impair our ability to commercialize or develop AEROSURF or other aerosolized KL4 surfactant products. 40 Table of Contents ● We will also require additional capital to advance our development activities and plan to seek a potential strategic partner or third-party collaborator to provide financial support and potentially medical device development expertise. There can be no assurance, however, that we will successfully identify or be able to enter into agreements with such potential partners or collaborators on terms and conditions that are favorable to us. If we are unable to secure the necessary medical device development expertise to support our development program, this could impair our ability to commercialize or develop AEROSURF or other aerosolized KL4 surfactant products. The realization of any of the foregoing risks would have a material adverse effect on our business. Manufacturing problems potentially could cause us to delay preclinical or clinical programs, or, if our products are approved, product launch, or cause us to experience shortages of product inventories, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. We, our contract manufacturers or our materials and drug substances suppliers may experience manufacturing or quality control problems that could result in a failure to maintain compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) and Quality requirements, or those of foreign regulators, which is necessary to continue manufacturing our drug products, materials or drug substances. Other problems that may be encountered include: ● the need to make necessary modifications to qualify and validate a facility; ● difficulties with production and yields, including manufacturing and completing all required release testing on a timely basis to meet demand; ● availability of raw materials and supplies; ● quality control and assurance; ● casualty damage to a facility; and ● shortages of qualified personnel. Such a failure could result in product production and shipment delays or an inability to obtain materials or drug substance supplies. For example, we manufacture our SURFAXIN drug product at our facility in Totowa, New Jersey. In December 2010, we began manufacturing additional SURFAXIN batches for use in the comprehensive preclinical program. In January 2011, quality control testing performed by us indicated that two newly manufactured SURFAXIN batches did not meet one of the pre-specified release specifications. In accordance with our quality assurance procedures and manufacturing practices, we conducted an investigation to determine why the SURFAXIN batches did not meet specification and, if appropriate, to implement a corrective action and preventative action plan. While we identified certain differences in the batches, we did not confirm a definitive root cause of the failures. Following the investigation, we implemented a process improvement and continued to manufacture SURFAXIN batches for use in the comprehensive preclinical program, which batches successfully met all specifications, including the specifications that the two unacceptable batches did not meet. In this instance, our efforts appear to have been successful. In January 2012, the FDA completed a pre-approval inspection (PAI) of our manufacturing facility and issued an Establishment Inspection Report indicating an approval recommendation for the commercial manufacture of SURFAXIN. Manufacturing or quality control problems may again occur at our facility in Totowa, New Jersey, or may occur at the facilities of a contract manufacturer of our drug substances and materials suppliers. Such problems may require potentially complex, time-consuming and costly comprehensive investigations to determine the root causes of such problems and may require detailed and time-consuming remediation efforts, which can further delay a return to normal manufacturing and production activities. Any failure by our own manufacturing operations or by the manufacturing operations of any of our suppliers to comply with cGMP requirements or other FDA or similar foreign regulatory requirements could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our drug products, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize SURFAXIN and potentially adversely affect our clinical research activities. 41 Table of Contents We currently do not have a back-up facility. Any interruption of our manufacturing operations at Totowa, NJ, could result in a shortage of our commercial drug supply of SURFAXIN and could affect our preclinical and clinical development activities. A number of factors could cause interruptions, including: ● equipment malfunctions or failures; ● technology malfunctions; ● work stoppages or slowdowns; ● damage to or destruction of the facility; ● regional power shortages; and ● product tampering. In connection with our manufacturing activities, we own certain specialized manufacturing equipment, employ experienced manufacturing senior executive and managerial personnel, and continue to invest in enhanced quality systems and manufacturing capabilities. However, we do not have fully-redundant systems and equipment to respond promptly in the event of a significant loss at our manufacturing operations. Under certain conditions, we may be unable to produce SURFAXIN at the required volumes or to appropriate standards, if at all. If we are unable to successfully maintain our manufacturing capabilities and at all times comply with cGMP, it will adversely affect our efforts to commercialize SURFAXIN and have an adverse effect on our sales. If the parties we depend on for supplying our active drug substances, materials and excipients as well as manufacturing-related services do not timely supply these products and services, it may delay or impair our ability to develop, manufacture and market our products. We rely on suppliers for our active drug substances, materials and excipients, and third parties for certain manufacturing-related services to manufacture drug product that meets appropriate content, quality and stability standards for use in preclinical programs and clinical trials and, if approved, for commercial distribution. Our ability to manufacture depends upon receiving adequate supplies and related services, which may be difficult or uneconomical to procure. The manufacturing process for AEROSURF, a combination drug-device product, includes the assembly of a number of component parts, many of which are comprised of a large number of subcomponent parts that we expect we will purchase from a potentially large number of manufacturers. We and our suppliers may not be able to (i) produce our drug substances, or manufacture materials and excipients or our drug product, or CAG device subcomponent parts or assembled devices, to appropriate standards for use in our preclinical programs or clinical studies, (ii) comply with manufacturing specifications under any definitive manufacturing, supply or services agreements with us, or (iii) maintain relationships with our suppliers and service providers for a sufficient time to successfully produce and market our product candidates. In some cases, we are dependent upon a single supplier to provide all of our requirements for one or more of our drug substances, materials and excipients or one or more of our drug product device subcomponents, components and subassemblies. To assure compliance with cGMP requirements, we have entered into Quality Agreements with all of our suppliers of active drug substances and related materials. However, we have a requirements contract relating to continued access to active drug substances with only one of three providers of our drug substances. If we do not maintain manufacturing and service relationships that are important to us and are not able to identify a replacement supplier or vendor or develop our own manufacturing capabilities, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products could be impaired or delayed and our costs could substantially increase. Even if we are able to find replacement manufacturers, suppliers and vendors when needed, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us or there could be a substantial delay before such manufacturer, vendor or supplier, or a related new facility is properly qualified and registered with the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities. Such delays could have a material adverse effect on our development activities and our business. Relying exclusively on third parties to manufacture certain of our drug product candidates and medical devices exposes us to risks that may delay our research and development activities, regulatory approval and commercialization of our drug product candidates. While we manufacture our SURFAXIN liquid instillate at our facilities in Totowa, NJ, we plan to depend upon third-party manufacturers to manufacture SURFAXIN LS, our lyophilized dosage form of SURFAXIN, AFECTAIR devices and our CAG. Our anticipated future reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks: 42 Table of Contents ● We may be unable to identify manufacturers with whom we might establish appropriate arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all, because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must approve any replacement contractor. This approval would require new testing and compliance inspections. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products after receipt of FDA approval, if any; ● Third-party manufacturers might be unable to manufacture our products in the volume and to our specifications to meet our clinical needs and, if approved, commercial needs; ● Contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our products; ● Product manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and / or quality system regulations (QSR) and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards; ● If any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products, we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any such innovation. We may be required to pay fees or other costs for access to such improvements; ● Each of these risks could delay our development programs, the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA or the commercialization of our product candidates or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues; If we fail to identify or maintain relationships with manufacturers and assemblers of our CAG devices, the timeline of our plans for the development and, if approved, commercialization of AEROSURF® and our other aerosolized KL4 surfactant products could suffer. We are exposed to similar risks with respect to the manufacture of our AFECTAIR® devices. In connection with the development of our aerosolized KL4 surfactant, including AEROSURF, which is a drug/device combination product, we currently plan to rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture and assemble the subcomponents of our CAG technology and to assemble the component parts to support our preclinical experiments, planned clinical studies and potential commercialization of AEROSURF. Certain of these components must be manufactured in an environmentally-controlled area and, when assembled, the critical drug product-contact components and ventilator circuit / patient interface connectors must be packaged. Each of the aerosolization system devices must be quality control tested prior to release and monitored for conformance to designated product specification. We have worked with selected component manufacturers to develop our initial prototype CAG device. We are currently focused on developing an optimized CAG device to meet regulatory and ease-of-use design requirements for AEROSURF and prepare for potential Phase 2 clinical trials. However, as with many device development initiatives, there is a risk that we will not be successful in our development efforts and that the manufacturers that we identify may not be able to consistently manufacture and assemble, if at all, the subcomponents of our CAG systems to our specified standards. In addition, we may not be able to identify qualified additional or replacement manufacturers and assemblers to manufacture subcomponents and assemble our optimized CAG system and, if developed, later versions of our CAG systems, or we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable and acceptable to us. In addition, the manufacturers and assemblers that we identify may be unable to timely comply with FDA, or other foreign regulatory agency, regulatory manufacturing requirements. If we do not successfully identify and enter into contractual agreements with manufacturers and assemblers that have the required expertise to produce our CAG devices as and when needed, it will adversely affect our timeline for the development and, if approved, commercialization of our aerosolized KL4 surfactant, including AEROSURF. Our relationship with Lacey exposes us to similar risks. We are reliant upon Lacey for, among other things, the manufacture, packaging and labeling of our AFECTAIR devices. These activities must be performed to specifications and in compliance with the QSR of the FDA and foreign regulators. Lacey is obligated to cooperate with us in the event of any release of defective product, including those that results in product recalls or other similar events. If Lacey is unable to manufacture to our specifications, or if Lacey fails to comply with the QSRs of the FDA or foreign regulators, it could have a material adverse effect on our development and commercial activities and our financial condition and prospects. 43 Table of Contents The cost of materials required for the manufacture of AFECTAIR® may increase or be higher than anticipated. The components of AFECTAIR are manufactured from high-quality medical grade materials that are generally recognized as safe. Suppliers of these materials, due to a change in their pricing policies or an increase in raw materials costs, might charge us increasingly higher than anticipated prices. In turn, we might experience diminishing profit margins or remain unprofitable indefinitely. Issues with product quality could have an adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation and cause a loss of customer confidence in our products or us. Our success depends upon the quality of our products. Our future revenues will depend upon our ability to develop, maintain, and continuously improve our quality management program, including an objective and systematic process for monitoring and the evaluation of key effectiveness indicators. Quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. We are dependent upon third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to support our development and commercialization activities. Third-party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards. Failure of a third-party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays or other quality-related issues. A quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in our current or future products or us, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in commercializing our products. AFECTAIR® product inadequacies could lead to recalls and harm our reputation, business and financial results. The design, manufacture and marketing of our medical device products involve certain inherent risks. Our products must be designed, manufactured and marketed to specific product specifications. Manufacturing or design defects, unanticipated use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals. We also may be restricted or prohibited from marketing or manufacturing a product, even after obtaining marketing authorization, if previously unknown problems with the product or its manufacture are subsequently discovered and we cannot provide assurance that newly discovered or developed safety issues will not arise following any regulatory clearance. The FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a mandatory recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. In addition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, initiate a field alert or action, known as a recall, for a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government mandated or voluntary recall by us or our third-party manufacturers or suppliers could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. We are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification to the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted. 44 Table of Contents Under the FDA medical device reporting regulation, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur. If we fail to report these events to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take enforcement action against us. Any such adverse event involving our products also could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results. Failure in our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information, customers and business opportunities. As we prepare for the commercialization of our first approved products, we will need extensive information technology (IT) systems in virtually all aspects of our business, including billing, customer service, logistics and management of clinical trial and medical data management. Our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire, power loss, system malfunction, unauthorized access and other events. Our success will depend, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems. IT systems may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, human acts and natural disasters. They also may be subject to physical or electronic intrusions, computer viruses, unauthorized tampering and similar disruptive problems. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Along with our new systems, we plan to take precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems. Nevertheless, we may experience damages to our systems, system failures and interruptions and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, and our data could be compromised. There can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns, breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation, business, operations or financial condition of the company. In addition, there can be no assurances that a significant implementation issue may not arise as we continue to implement new systems and consolidate or replace existing (legacy) systems. If we experience systems problems, they may interrupt our ability to operate. If we experience systems problems, or if we experience unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, it could adversely affect our reputation, result in a loss of customers and revenues and cause us to suffer financial damage, including significant costs to alleviate or eliminate the problem. If we do not adequately forecast customer demand for our approved products, including SURFAXIN® and AFECTAIR®, our business could suffer. We are also subject to risks associated with doing business globally. The timing and amount of customer demand and the commercial requirements to meet changing customer demand are difficult to predict. We may not be able to accurately forecast customer demand for our products and product candidates, starting with SURFAXIN and AFECTAIR, or to respond effectively to unanticipated increases in demand. This could have an adverse effect on our business. If we overestimate customer demand, or attempt to commercialize products for which the market is smaller than we anticipate, we could incur significant unrecoverable costs from creating excess capacity. In addition, the current economic conditions may result in reduced demand for our products, increased pricing pressure, longer sales cycles, and slower adoption rates for our products. Conditions in the healthcare industry, including lower healthcare utilization, cost containment efforts by governments and other payers for healthcare services and other factors may result in weaker overall customer demand and increased pricing pressure for our products. The current economic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers, which could affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products. 45 Table of Contents We expect to offer certain of our products in the European Union and elsewhere, which subjects us to risks associated with doing business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. These risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, changes in exchange controls, increasingly complex labor environments, expropriation and other governmental actions, availability of raw materials, changes in taxation, importation limitations, export control restrictions, changes in or violations of U.S. or local laws, including the FCPA, pricing restrictions, economic and political instability, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property, and disruption in a significant geographic region regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws and regulations that affect our business could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our CEFF and ATM Program may become unavailable to us if we do not comply with their conditions. Except for our CEFF and ATM Program (which are subject to certain limitations), we currently do not have arrangements to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to meet the conditions provided under the CEFF and ATM Program, we will not be able to issue any portion of the shares potentially available for issuance thereunder and these programs may expire unutilized. In addition, our ability to utilize the ATM Program or any new CEFF in the future may be impaired. In February 2011, we issued five-year warrants that contain anti-dilution provisions that potentially adjust the exercise price of these warrants upon the issuance of securities at prices lower than the warrant exercise price. The warrant anti-dilution provisions are not triggered by draw downs under our existing CEFF but are triggered by financings under the ATM Program or any new CEFF. In that event, the potential dilutive effect of a financing could be increased if the applicable purchase price of such financing is less than the exercise price of the warrants, which could result in a decline in the market price of our stock. Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock, including pursuant to our CEFF and ATM Program, stock incentive plans and upon the exercise of outstanding securities exercisable for shares of our common stock, could result in substantial additional dilution of our stockholders, cause our stock price to fall and adversely affect our ability to raise capital. We will require additional capital to continue to execute our business plan and advance our research and development efforts. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the issuance of additional equity securities and through the exercise of outstanding warrants, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell shares of our common stock in one or more transactions at prices that may be at a discount to the then-current market value of our common stock and on such other terms and conditions as we may determine from time to time. Any such transaction could result in substantial dilution of our existing stockholders. If we sell shares of our common stock in more than one transaction, stockholders who purchase our common stock may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales could also cause a drop in the market price of our common stock. The issuance of shares of our common stock under the CEFF and the ATM Program has, and the issuance of shares upon exercise of the warrants we issued to Kingsbridge in connection with our CEFFs will have, a dilutive impact on our other stockholders and the issuance, or even potential issuance, of such shares could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, if we access the ATM Program, we will pay Lazard a commission equal to three percent of the aggregate purchase price. If we access the CEFF, we will issue shares of our common stock to Kingsbridge at a discount (from 4.38% to 17.5%, depending upon the market price) to the daily volume-weighted average price of our common stock on each trading day, which will further dilute the interests of other stockholders. See, “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Committed Equity Financing Facility (CEFF).” Furthermore, to the extent that Kingsbridge sells to third parties the shares of our common stock that we sell to Kingsbridge under the CEFF, our stock price may decrease due to the additional selling pressure in the market. The perceived risk of dilution from sales of stock to or by Kingsbridge may cause holders of our common stock to sell their shares, or it may encourage short sales of our common stock or other similar transactions. This could contribute to a decline in the stock price of our common stock. 46 Table of Contents We also filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 (File No. 333-174786) on June 8, 2011 (which was declared effective shortly thereafter) for the proposed offering from time to time of up to $200 million of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, varying forms of debt and warrant securities, or any combination of the foregoing. We have issued securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement on several occasions, and may do so again in the future in response to market conditions or other circumstances on terms and conditions that will be determined at such time. As of March 21, 2012, we had 43,307,867 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. In addition, as of December 31, 2011, approximately (i) 13.0 million shares of our common stock were reserved for potential issuance upon the exercise of outstanding warrants, (ii) 2.4 million shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans, and (iii) 342,833 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to our 401(k) Plan. The exercise of stock options and other securities could cause our stockholders to experience substantial dilution. Moreover, holders of our stock options and warrants are likely to exercise them, if ever, at a time when we otherwise could obtain a price for the sale of our securities that is higher than the exercise price per security of the options or warrants. Such exercises, or the possibility of such exercises, may impede our efforts to obtain additional financing through the sale of additional securities or make such financing more costly. It may also reduce the price of our common stock. If, during the term of certain of our warrants, we declare or make any dividend or other distribution of our assets to holders of shares of our common stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement or other similar transaction), then the exercise price of such warrants may adjust downward and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants would increase. In addition, in February 2011, we issued five-year warrants that contain an anti-dilution provision that, subject to certain exclusions, potentially adjusts the exercise price of these warrants upon the issuance of securities at prices lower than the warrant exercise price. For the purpose of valuing securities that we may issue in the future in unit offerings, this anti-dilution provision values the warrant portion of a unit offering based on a Black Scholes pricing model. When such Black Scholes value is subtracted from the actual per-unit price of the offering, per-share value of the shares issued in such unit offering is decreased for the purposes of the anti-dilution provision. If we issue shares, units, or warrants in a financing that triggers the anti-dilution provision of our February 2011 five-year warrants, the exercise price of the February 2011 five-year warrants will be lowered thereby, increasing the likelihood that such warrants would be exercised. As a result of such warrant adjustments, we may be required to issue more shares of common stock, or shares at lower prices, than previously anticipated, which could result in further dilution of our existing stockholders. The market price of our stock may be adversely affected by market volatility. The market price of our common stock, like that of many other development stage pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, has been and is likely to be volatile. In addition to general economic, political and market conditions, the price and trading volume of our stock could fluctuate widely in response to many factors, including: ● announcements of the results of clinical trials by us or our competitors; ● patient adverse reactions to drug products; ● governmental approvals, delays in expected governmental approvals or withdrawals of any prior governmental approvals or public or regulatory agency concerns regarding the safety or effectiveness of our products; ● changes in the United States or foreign regulatory policy during the period of product development; ● changes in the United States or foreign political environment and the passage of laws, including tax, environmental or other laws, affecting the product development business; ● developments in patent or other proprietary rights, including any third-party challenges of our intellectual property rights; ● announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors; ● announcements of new products or new contracts by us or our competitors; ● actual or anticipated variations in our operating results due to the level of development expenses and other factors; ● changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and whether our earnings meet or exceed the estimates; 47 Table of Contents ● conditions and trends in the pharmaceutical and other industries; ● new accounting standards; and ● the occurrence of any of the risks described in these “Risk Factors” or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other public filings. Our common stock is listed for quotation on The Nasdaq Capital Market. During the 12-month period ended December 31, 2011, the price of our common stock ranged between $1.44 and $4.18. We expect the price of our common stock to remain volatile. The average daily trading volume in our common stock varies significantly. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2011, the average daily trading volume in our common stock, was approximately 389,347 shares, and the average number of transactions per day, was approximately 796. The instability observed in our daily volume and number of transactions per day may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares in the public market at prevailing prices. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of the securities of companies in our industry, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies in our industry. Even if securities class actions that may be filed against us in the future were ultimately determined to be meritless or unsuccessful, they would involve substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources, which could negatively affect our business. If we fail to adhere to the strict listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market®, we may be subject to delisting. As a result, our stock price may decline and, following a hearing, our common stock may be delisted. If our stock were no longer listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the liquidity of our securities likely would be impaired. Our common stock currently trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol DSCO. If we fail to adhere to the market’s strict listing criteria, our stock may be delisted. This could potentially impair the liquidity of our securities not only in the number of shares that could be bought and sold at a given price, which might be depressed by the relative illiquidity, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and the potential reduction in media coverage. As a result, an investor might find it more difficult to dispose of our common stock. We believe that current and prospective investors would view an investment in our common stock more favorably if it continues to be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In December 2009, we received a letter from The Nasdaq Global Market® (Global Market) indicating that we had failed to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) (Minimum Bid Price Rule), which requires that we maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share. Anticipating that we would not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule on or before June 1, 2010, in May 2010, we applied to transfer our common stock to the Nasdaq Capital Market, which was effective on June 4, 2010. Based on our ability to comply with all listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market other than the Minimum Bid Price Rule, Nasdaq also granted us an additional 180 days, or until November 29, 2010, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. On November 30, 2010, we received written notification from Nasdaq that our common stock was subject to delisting because we had not regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule within the 180-day period previously granted. We requested a hearing with a Nasdaq Hearing Panel, which stayed the delisting of our stock pending the Panel’s review. On December 28, 2010, we implemented a 1-for-15 reverse stock split, after which the closing market price of our stock was above $1.00. On January 11, 2011, following our hearing, the Nasdaq Hearing Panel determined that we had regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule because our common stock had maintained a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share over a period of 10 consecutive business days. Currently, our common stock continues to comply with all Nasdaq Listing Requirements for the Nasdaq Capital Market. Although we have regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain continued compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule or the other listing requirements of Nasdaq. There can be no assurance that the closing bid price of our common stock will continue to trade above $1.00. Moreover, if trading activity in our common stock were to reduce the total market capitalization of our company, we may find it difficult to fund our activities, which would result in reductions in our stockholders’ equity. In addition to the Minimum Bid Price Rule, certain other Nasdaq continued listing requirements require that we maintain a market capitalization of at least $35 million or stockholders’ equity of at least $2.5 million. If we were unable to meet these requirements, we would receive another delisting notice from the Nasdaq Capital Market for failure to comply with one or more of the continued listing requirements. 48 Table of Contents We expect to face uncertainty over reimbursement and healthcare reform. In both the United States and other countries, sales of our products will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers, which include governmental health administration authorities, managed care providers and private health insurers. Government and other healthcare payers increasingly challenge the price and examine the cost effectiveness of medical products and services. Moreover, the current political environment in the United States and abroad may result in the passage of significant legislation that could, among other things, restructure the markets in which we operate and restrict pricing strategies of drug development companies. If, for example, price restrictions were placed on the distribution of our drugs, we may be forced to curtail development of our pipeline products and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we succeed in commercializing our drug products, uncertainties regarding health care policy, legislation and regulation, as well as private market practices, could affect our ability to sell our products in quantities or at prices that will enable us to achieve profitability. To obtain reimbursement from a third-party payer, it must determine that our drug product is a covered benefit under its health plan, which is likely to require a determination that our product is: ● safe, effective and medically necessary; ● appropriate for the specific patient; ● cost-effective; and ● neither experimental nor investigational. Obtaining a determination that a product is a covered benefit may be a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data about our products to each payer. We may not be able to provide sufficient data to gain coverage. Even when a payer determines that a product is covered, the payer may impose limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Cost-containment measures, if implemented to affect the coverage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products profitably. Moreover, coverage does not imply that any product will be covered in all cases or that reimbursement will be available at a rate that would permit a health care provider to cover its costs of using our product. Prices in many countries, including many in Europe, are subject to local regulation and certain pharmaceutical products may be subject to price controls in several of the world’s principal markets, including many countries within the European Union. In the United States, where pricing levels for our products are substantially established by third-party payers, if payers reduce the amount of reimbursement for a product, it may cause groups or individuals dispensing the product to discontinue administration of the product, to administer lower doses, to substitute lower cost products or to seek additional price-related concessions. These actions could have a negative effect on our financial results, particularly in cases where our products command a premium price in the marketplace. The existence of direct and indirect price controls and pressures over our products could materially adversely affect our financial prospects and performance. The implementation of the 2010 Health Care Reform Law in the United States may adversely affect our business. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010, generally known as the Health Care Reform Law, significantly expands health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers. We expect expansion of access to health insurance may increase the demand for our products, but other provisions of the Health Care Reform Law could affect us adversely. We also expect that further federal and state proposals for healthcare reform are likely. The changes contemplated by the health care reform law are subject to rule-making and implementation timelines that extend for several years, and this uncertainty limits our ability to forecast changes that may occur in the future. However, any changes that lower reimbursements for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 49 Table of Contents The Health Care Reform Law establishes new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. Data collection obligations were to commence in January 2012, and reporting requirements are to be implemented in 2013. On December 14, 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued proposed regulations to implement these provisions and sought substantial comments, thereby apparently delaying the January 1, 2012 start of information collection. These proposed regulations are broadly drafted and still subject to change, and it is possible that when these regulations are finalized, our contract manufacturers or we will be subject to these reporting requirements. In addition, several states require pharmaceutical and/or device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of products as well as gifts and payments to individual practitioners in the states, or prohibit certain marketing related activities. Other states, such as California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Connecticut, require pharmaceutical and/or device companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Wholesale distributors are covered by the laws in certain of these states. In others, it is possible that we will be subject us to the state’s reporting requirements and prohibitions. Compliance activities with respect to these measures could increase our costs and adversely affect business operations. The Health Care Reform Law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of Medicare and Medicaid, including imposing a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of medical devices by manufacturers and importers beginning in 2013, and a fee on branded prescription drugs that was implemented in 2011, both of which may affect sales of our products. As U.S. net sales are expected to be a significant portion of our worldwide net sales in the coming years, this additional tax burden may have a material, negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows. The Health Care Reform Law also mandates pharmacy benefit manager transparency regarding rebates, discounts and price concessions with respect to drug benefits under Medicare Part D, and in 2014 with respect to drug benefits offered through qualified health plans offered through state exchanges, which could affect pricing and competition. Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we plan to do business, including the United States. The Health Care Reform Law establishes the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which will be responsible, beginning in 2014, annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing Medicare cost growth while preserving quality. These proposals automatically will be implemented unless Congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets. Further, the legislation calls for a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation that will examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs. The legislation provides for extensive health insurance reforms, including the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage, fixed percentages on medical loss ratios, expansion in Medicaid and other programs, employer mandates, individual mandates, creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges, and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage. The legislation also permits the establishment of accountable care organizations, a new healthcare delivery model. While the ultimate impact of the legislation on the healthcare industry is unknown, it is likely to be extensive and may result in significant change. Our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which will likely result in significant legal and accounting expense and diversion of management resources, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the market price of our stock will likely decline. We are required by the SEC to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls. 50 Table of Contents In our internal control report for our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2010, management was unable to conclude that we had maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2010, and identified a material weakness regarding our process and procedures related to the initial classification and subsequent accounting of registered warrants as liabilities or equity instruments. Upon a reassessment of those financial instruments, in light of GAAP as currently interpreted, we determined that we should have accounted for registered warrants that we issued in May 2009 and February 2010 as derivative liabilities instead of equity. As a result, to reclassify the affected warrants as derivative liabilities, in November 2010, we restated our consolidated financial statements for the periods ended June 30, 2009 through June 30, 2010. The process to restate our financial statements was highly time-consuming, resource-intensive and involved substantial attention from management and significant legal and accounting expense. To remediate the identified material weakness in our internal controls, we have enhanced our process to identify and correctly apply developments in accounting and to improve our understanding of the nuances of increasingly complex accounting standards. We have improved access to the accounting literature, research materials and documents and increased communication among our legal and finance personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. Any failure to maintain internal controls could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the SEC and Nasdaq, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. We can give no assurance that additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. In addition, although we believe that we have remediated the material weakness that we identified in November 2010, in the future our controls and procedures may no longer be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements. Responding to inquiries from the SEC or Nasdaq in the future will, regardless of the outcome, likely consume a significant amount of our management resources and cause us to incur significant legal and accounting expense. Further, many companies that have restated their historical financial statements have experienced a decline in stock price and related stockholder lawsuits. We depend upon key employees and consultants in a competitive market for skilled personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, it could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products. We will need to hire additional qualified personnel to support (i) the commercialization of SURFAXIN and AFECTAIR, and (ii) the advancement of our SURFAXIN LS and AEROSURF development programs. In particular, over the next 12 months, we expect to hire approximately 50 new employees primarily in the areas of field based sales and marketing, medical affairs, regulatory affairs, and quality control and assurance. We expect that the hiring of such additional personnel will increase our annual expenditures by approximately $8.0 million. We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is significant, and attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success, and any failure to do so successfully may have a material adverse effect on us. We are highly dependent upon the members of our executive management team and our directors, as well as our scientific advisory board members, consultants and collaborating scientists. Many of these individuals have been involved with us for many years, have played integral roles in our progress and we believe that they continue to provide value to us. A loss of any of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on aspects of our business and clinical development and regulatory programs. As of December 31, 2011, we had employment agreements with four executive officers, including Chief Executive Officer; President and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Senior Vice President, Human Resources. These agreements provide for automatic one-year renewal at the end of each term, unless otherwise terminated by either party, and will expire in May 2012. In February 2012, we provided notice of non-renewal for these agreements. In addition, in May 2010, we entered into retention agreements with five other executive officers under which each officer is provided certain severance benefits, based on title. These agreements also expire in May 2012. Prior to the May 2012 expiration date for the executive officer agreements, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors expects to review market and other compensation data, as well as other information that the Committee may request, with a view to entering into new agreements with our executive officers. The loss of services from any of our executives could significantly adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products and obtain necessary regulatory approvals. Further, we do not maintain key man life insurance. 51 Table of Contents As we prepare for the commercialization of our approved products, we will need to attract candidates to join our management, commercial, medical affairs and development teams, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in that endeavor. We may be unable to attract and retain necessary executive talent. Our industry generally seeks to attract and retain executive talent with compensation packages that include a significant equity component. Moreover, the equity incentives, including options and restricted stock, that we have issued are, for the most part, significantly devalued or out of the money and less likely to be exercisable in the future. We plan in the future to seek stockholder approval for additional authorizations to support the use of equity incentives. However, there can be no assurance that our stockholders will approve such incentives and, even if our stockholders approve new equity incentives that we will be able to attract and retain key executive talent in the interim period. Our future success also will depend in part on the continued service of our key scientific and management personnel and our ability to identify, hire and retain additional personnel. While we attempt to provide competitive compensation packages to attract and retain key personnel at all levels in our organization, many of our competitors have greater resources and more experience than we do, making it difficult for us to compete successfully for key personnel. We may experience intense competition for qualified personnel and the existence of non-competition agreements between prospective employees and their former employers may prevent us from hiring those individuals or subject us to lawsuits brought by their former employers. Our industry is highly competitive and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors, which may give them an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete. Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological innovation and evolving industry standards. We compete with numerous existing companies intensely in many ways. We intend to market our products under development for the treatment of diseases for which other technologies and treatments are rapidly developing and, consequently, we expect new companies to enter our industry and that competition in the industry will increase. Many of these companies have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, technological, personnel and managerial resources than we have. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or with their collaborative partners, have significantly greater experience than we do in: ● developing products; ● undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials; ● obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals or products; and ● manufacturing and marketing products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA or foreign regulatory approval or commercializing products before us. If we commence commercial product sales, we will compete against companies with greater marketing and manufacturing capabilities that may successfully develop and commercialize products that are more effective or less expensive than our products. As none of our products are approved, we currently have limited or no experience in these areas. In addition, developments by our competitors may render our drug product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. We also face, and will continue to face, competition from colleges, universities, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations. These competitors frequently aggressively seek patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties for use of technology that they have developed. Some of these technologies may compete directly with the technologies that we are developing. These institutions will also compete with us in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel. We expect that therapeutic developments in the areas in which we are active may occur at a rapid rate and that competition will intensify as advances in this field are made. As a result, we need to continue to devote substantial resources and efforts to research and development activities. 52 Table of Contents If we cannot protect our intellectual property, other companies could use our technology in competitive products. Even if we obtain patents to protect our products, those patents may not be sufficiently broad or they may expire and others could then compete with us. We seek patent protection for our drug product candidates to prevent others from commercializing equivalent products in substantially less time and at substantially lower expense. The pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes. Our success will depend in part on our ability and that of parties from whom we license technology to successfully obtain patents, defend our patents and otherwise prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights, including our trade secrets. The patent position of companies relying upon biotechnology is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved. To date, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has not adopted a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims that it will allow in biotechnology patents or the degree of protection that these types of patents afford. As a result, there are risks that we may not secure rights to products or processes that appear to be patentable. The parties licensing technologies to us and we have filed various United States and foreign patent applications with respect to the products and technologies under our development, and the USPTO and foreign patent offices have issued patents with respect to our products and technologies. These patent applications include international applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. Our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future or those we may license from third parties may not result in the USPTO or foreign patent office issuing patents. In addition, if patent rights covering our products are not sufficiently broad, they may not provide us with sufficient proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products and technologies. Furthermore, even if the USPTO or foreign patent offices were to issue patents to us or our licensors, others may challenge the patents or circumvent the patents, or the patent office or the courts may invalidate the patents. Thus, any patents we own or license from or to third parties may not provide us any protection against competitors. The patents that we hold also have a limited life. We have licensed a series of patents for our KL4 surfactant technology from J&J and its wholly-owned subsidiary Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation (Ortho Pharmaceutical), which are important, both individually and collectively, to our strategy of commercializing our KL4 surfactant products. These patents, which include important KL4 composition of matter claims and relevant European patents, began to expire in November 2009, and will expire on various dates ending in 2017 or, in some cases, possibly later. Of the patents that have expired, we have extended the term of our most important patent until November 2012, with further extensions possible into 2014. For our aerosolized KL4 surfactant, we hold exclusive licenses in the United States and outside the United States to PMUSA’s CAG technology for use with pulmonary surfactants for all respiratory diseases. Our exclusive license in the United States also extends to other (non-surfactant) drugs to treat a wide range of pediatric and adult respiratory indications in hospitals and other health care institutions. The CAG technology patents expire on various dates beginning in May 2016 and ending in 2023, or, in some cases, possibly later. We have filed, and when possible and appropriate, will file, other patent applications with respect to our products and processes in the United States and in foreign countries. We may not be able to develop enhanced or additional products or processes that will be patentable under patent law and, if we do enhance or develop additional products that we believe are patentable, additional patents may not be issued to us. See also, “– If we cannot meet requirements under our license agreements, we could lose the rights to our products.” Our technology platform is based solely on our proprietary KL4 surfactant technology, our novel CAG technology, and our novel ventilator circuit / patient interface connectors. Our technology platform is based on the scientific rationale of using our KL4 surfactant technology, our CAG technology and our novel patient interface and related componentry to treat life-threatening respiratory disorders and to serve as the foundation for the development of novel respiratory therapies and products. Our business is dependent upon the successful development and approval of our drug product candidates and our drug-device combination products based on these technologies. Any material problems with our technology platforms could have a material adverse effect on our business. 53 Table of Contents Intellectual property rights of third parties could limit our ability to develop and market our products. Our commercial success also depends upon our ability to operate our business without infringing the patents or violating the proprietary rights of others. In certain cases, the USPTO keeps United States patent applications confidential while the applications are pending. As a result, we cannot determine in advance what inventions third parties may claim in their pending patent applications. We may need to defend or enforce our patent and license rights or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others through legal proceedings, which would be costly, unpredictable and time consuming. Even in proceedings where the outcome is favorable to us, they would likely divert substantial resources, including management time, from our other activities. Moreover, any adverse determination could subject us to significant liability or require us to seek licenses that third parties might not grant to us or might only grant at rates that diminish or deplete the profitability of our products. An adverse determination could also require us to alter our products or processes or cease altogether any product sales or related research and development activities. If we cannot meet requirements under our license agreements, we could lose the rights to our products. We depend on licensing agreements with third parties to maintain the intellectual property rights to our products under development. Presently, we have licensed rights from J&J, Ortho Pharmaceutical, PMUSA and PMPSA. These agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations to maintain our rights under these licensing agreements. All of these agreements last either throughout the life of the patents or for a number of years after the first commercial sale of the relevant product. In addition, we are responsible for the cost of filing and prosecuting certain patent applications and maintaining certain issued patents licensed to us. If we do not meet our obligations under our license agreements in a timely manner, we could lose the rights to our proprietary technology. Finally, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties in connection with the development and use of our products and technologies. Licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights might not be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. We rely on confidentiality agreements that could be breached and may be difficult to enforce. Although we take what we believe to be reasonable steps to protect our intellectual property, including the use of agreements relating to the non-disclosure of our confidential information to third parties, as well as agreements that provide for disclosure and assignment to us of all rights to the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions of our employees and consultants while we employ them, such agreements can be difficult and costly to enforce. We generally seek to enter into these types of agreements with consultants, advisors and research collaborators; however, to the extent that such parties apply or independently develop intellectual property in connection with any of our projects, disputes may arise concerning allocation of the related proprietary rights. Such disputes often involve significant expense and yield unpredictable results. In addition, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors or others. Despite the protective measures we employ, we still face the risk that: ● agreements may be breached; ● agreements may not provide adequate remedies for the applicable type of breach; ● our trade secrets or proprietary know-how may otherwise become known; ● our competitors may independently develop similar technology; or ● our competitors may independently discover our proprietary information and trade secrets. 54 Table of Contents Moreover, although our four senior executive officers have agreements that include non-competition covenants and provide for severance payments that are contingent upon the applicable employee’s refraining from competition with us, such noncompete provisions can be difficult and costly to monitor and enforce, such that, if any should resign, we may not be successful in enforcing our noncompetition agreements with them. The failure to prevail in litigation or the costs of litigation, including securities class action, product liability and patent claims, could harm our financial performance and business operations. We are potentially susceptible to litigation. For example, as a public company, we may be subject to claims asserting violations of securities laws. Even if such actions are found to be without merit, the potential impact of such actions, which generally seek unquantified damages and attorneys’ fees and expenses, is uncertain. There can be no assurance that an adverse result in any future proceeding would not have a potentially material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business activities, including manufacturing and marketing our drug products and medical devices also exposes us to liability risks. Using our drug product candidates or medical devices in clinical trials may expose us to product liability claims. For our products that are approved for commercial sale, the risk of product liability claims is increased. Even if approved, our products may be subject to claims resulting from unintended effects that result in injury or death. In addition, we may be subject to product liability claims involving our AFECTAIR and other medical devices and alleged design defects or other safety issues that result in an unsafe condition leading to injury or death. Product liability claims alleging inadequate disclosure and warnings in our package inserts and medical device disclosures also may arise. The design, manufacture and marketing of SURFAXIN and the AFECTAIR devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims. There are a number of factors that could result in an unsafe condition or injury to a patient, including manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. We presently carry general liability, excess liability, products liability and property insurance coverage in amounts that are customary for companies in our industry of comparable size and level of activity. However, our insurance policies contain various deductibles, limitations and exclusions from coverage, and in any event might not fully cover any potential claims. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation. We may need to obtain additional product liability insurance coverage, including with locally-authorized insurers licensed in countries where we market our approved products or conduct our clinical trials, before initiating clinical trials; however, such insurance is expensive and may not be available when we need it. In the future, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance, with acceptable limits and retentions, at an acceptable cost. Any product, general liability or product liability claim, even if such claim is within the limits of our insurance coverage or meritless and/or unsuccessful, could adversely affect the availability or cost of insurance generally and our cash available for other purposes, such as research and development. In addition, such claims could result in: ● uninsured expenses related to defense or payment of substantial monetary awards to claimants; ● a decrease in demand for our drug product candidates; ● damage to our reputation; and ● an inability to complete clinical trial programs or to commercialize our drug product candidates, if approved. Moreover, the existence of a product liability claim could affect the market price of our common stock. 55 Table of Contents In addition, as the USPTO keeps United States patent applications confidential in certain cases while the applications are pending, we cannot ensure that our products or methods do not infringe upon the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are applied for and issued, the risk increases that our patents or patent applications for our KL4 surfactant product candidates may give rise to a declaration of interference by the USPTO, or to administrative proceedings in foreign patent offices, or that our activities lead to claims of patent infringement by other companies, institutions or individuals. These entities or persons could bring legal proceedings against us seeking to invalidate our patents, obtain substantial damages or enjoin us from conducting research and development activities. Our corporate compliance program cannot ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations affecting our activities in the jurisdictions in which we may sell our products, if approved, and a failure to comply with such regulations or prevail in litigation related to noncompliance could harm our business. Many of our activities, including the research, development, manufacture, sale and marketing of our products, are subject to extensive laws and regulation, including without limitation, health care "fraud and abuse" laws, such as the federal false claims act, the federal anti-kickback statute, and other state and federal laws and regulations. We have developed and implemented a corporate compliance policy and oversight program based upon what we understand to be current industry best practices, but we cannot assure you that this program will protect us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such investigations, actions or lawsuits are instituted against us, and if we are not successful in defending or disposing of them without liability, such investigations, actions or lawsuits could result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions and could otherwise have a significant impact on our business. Provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, our Amended and Restated By-Laws, our Shareholder Rights Agreement and Delaware law could defer a change of our management and thereby discourage or delay offers to acquire us. Provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, our Amended and Restated By-Laws, our Shareholder Rights Agreement and Delaware law may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or for our stockholders to remove existing management, and might discourage a third-party from offering to acquire us, even if a change in control or in management would be beneficial to our stockholders. For example, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, allows us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders. Our Board of Directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, before the redemption of our common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors, without further stockholder approval, could issue large blocks of preferred stock. We have adopted a Shareholder Rights Agreement, which under certain circumstances would significantly impair the ability of third parties to acquire control of us without prior approval of our Board of Directors thereby discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals. The rights issued under the Shareholder Rights Agreement would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our Board of Directors.
