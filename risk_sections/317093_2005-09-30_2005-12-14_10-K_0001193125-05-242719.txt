Item 1A. Risk Factors Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements. We have made forward-looking statements in this annual report including in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, other written or oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements may be made by or on behalf of the company. Although we have based these statements on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to them, they are subject to risks and uncertainties. We wish to ensure that such statements are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements, so as to obtain the protections of the safe harbor established in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Accordingly, such statements are qualified by reference to the discussion below of certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements. We caution the reader that the list of factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. We cannot predict such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact, if any, of such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be put on any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The following risks and uncertainties, among others, should be considered in evaluating our growth outlook. Over the last three years we have completed several acquisitions and may continue to make acquisitions in the future. We believe that these acquisitions provide strategic growth opportunities for the company. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating acquisitions or to otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations. Realizing the benefits of acquisitions will depend on our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions with our existing operations. Our inability to successfully integrate operations in a timely manner may result in the company not realizing the anticipated benefits or synergies of these acquisitions. The integration of companies is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process that could significantly disrupt our business. The anticipated benefits and synergies of acquisitions are based on projections and assumptions, not actual experience, and assume a successful integration. In addition, the companys ability to realize these benefits and synergies could be adversely impacted by practical or legal constraints on our ability to combine operations or implement workforce reductions and by risks relating to potential unknown liabilities. The challenges involved in successfully integrating acquisitions include: consolidating and rationalizing information systems and manufacturing operations, combining product offerings, coordinating and rationalizing research and development activities, preserving distribution, marketing or other important relationships, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, and coordinating and combining overseas operations, relationships and facilities, which may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws and regulations. Deterioration of the wireless infrastructure industry could lead to reductions in capital spending budgets by wireless operators and original equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our revenues, gross margins and income. Our revenues and gross margins will depend significantly on the overall demand for wireless infrastructure subsystems products. A reduction in capital spending budgets by wireless operators and original equipment manufacturers caused by an economic downturn could lead to a softening in demand for our products and services, which could result in a decrease in revenues and earnings. 13 Table of Contents The telecommunications industry has experienced significant consolidation, and this trend is expected to continue. It is possible that we and one or more of our competitors each supply products to the companies that have merged or will merge. This consolidation could result in delays in purchasing decisions by merged companies or in us playing a decreased role in the supply of products to the merged companies. Delays or reductions in wireless infrastructure spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and, consequently, our results of operations, prospects and stock price. Because we depend on several large customers for a significant portion of our revenues, sales, operating margins and income would be adversely affected by any disruption of our relationship with these customers or any material adverse change in their businesses. We depend on several large OEMs and wireless service providers for a significant portion of our business. In 2005, the top 25 customers accounted for 69% of sales. The most significant of these customers are Cingular Wireless and Lucent Technologies. Cingular Wireless was the only customer that accounted for more than 10% of sales in 2005. Any disruption in our relationships with our major customers, including any adverse modification of our supply agreements with them or the unwillingness or inability of them to perform their obligations under supply agreements, would adversely affect our sales, operating margins and income. In addition, any material adverse change in the financial condition of any of our major customers would have similar adverse effects. Continuing and future sales opportunities for our geolocation products and services are uncertain, and if we cannot develop such opportunities, our sales and income will be reduced. The Federal Communications Commission has promulgated regulations requiring wireless communications carriers to provide caller location information for wireless 911 calls. The systems by which this location information is supplied are often described as E-911 solutions. The company offers network-based geolocation products and services that enable carriers to effectively implement network-based E-911 solutions. Changes in technology and regulations, or our inability to meet customers evolving requirements, could affect our ability to develop continuing and future sales opportunities for network-based geolocation products and services. In addition, the companys historically largest customer for geolocation products has been AT&T Wireless, which was acquired by Cingular Wireless in October 2004. Cingular Wireless has historically used a competitors geolocation products and has informed the company that it will purchase the competitors product for Cingulars network, including the network acquired from AT&T Wireless. As such, the companys sales will be adversely impacted if we cannot develop sales opportunities to offset the expected decreased demand for geolocation products, continue to meet customer requirements, or successfully market our products. Our revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights. We generally rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, partners and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations. However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or our intellectual property rights may not provide competitive advantages, which could significantly harm our business. Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the wireless industry, a portion of our business and our products may rely on key technologies developed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all. Third parties also may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Even if we do not believe that our products or business are infringing upon third parties intellectual property rights, the claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter into costly settlement or license agreements. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all or on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, our sales, operating margins and income could suffer. A substantial portion of our manufacturing capacity and business activity is outside the United States. Conducting business in international markets involves risks and uncertainties such as foreign exchange rate exposure and political and economic instability that could lead to reduced international sales and reduced profitability associated with such sales, which would reduce our sales and income. A significant portion of our sales are outside the United States. We anticipate that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales and that continued growth and profitability will require further international expansion. Identifiable foreign exchange rate exposures result primarily from currency fluctuations, accounts receivable from customer sales, the anticipated purchase of products from affiliates and third-party suppliers and the repayment of inter-company loans denominated in foreign currencies with our foreign subsidiaries. 14 Table of Contents International business risks also include political and economic instability, tariffs and other trade barriers, longer customer payment cycles, burdensome taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of earnings, expropriation or requirements of local or shared ownership, compliance with local laws and regulations, terrorist attacks, developing legal systems, reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries, cultural and language differences, difficulties in managing and staffing operations and difficulties maintaining good employee relations. We believe that international risks and uncertainties could lead to reduced international sales and reduced profitability associated with such sales, which would reduce our sales and income. The competitive pressures we face could lead to reduced demand or lower prices for our products and services in favor of our competitors products and services, which could harm our sales, gross margins and prospects. We encounter aggressive competition from a variety of competitors in all areas of our business, and compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution, customer service and support. If we fail to develop new products and services, periodically enhance our existing products and services, or otherwise compete successfully, it would reduce our sales and prospects. Further, we may have to continue to lower the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive. If we cannot reduce our costs in response to competitive price pressures, our gross margins would decline. If we cannot continue to rapidly develop, manufacture and market innovative products and services that meet customer requirements for performance and reliability, we may lose market share and our revenues may suffer. The process of developing new wireless technology products and services is complex and uncertain, and failure to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately and to develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property could significantly harm our results of operations. We must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our investments will eventually result in products that the market will accept. After a product is developed, we must be able to manufacture sufficient volumes quickly and at low costs. To accomplish this, we must accurately forecast volumes, product mix and configurations that meet customer requirements, which we may not be able to do successfully. Among the factors that make a smooth transition from current products to new products difficult are delays in product development or manufacturing, variations in product costs, delays in customer purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product introductions and customer demand for the new product. Our revenues and gross margins may suffer if we cannot make such a transition effectively and also may suffer due to the timing of product or service introductions by our suppliers and competitors. This is especially challenging when a product has a short life cycle or a competitor introduces a new product just before our own product introduction. Furthermore, sales of our new products may replace sales of some of our current products, offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction. If we incur delays in new product introductions, or do not accurately estimate the market effects of new product introductions, given the competitive nature of our industry, future demand for our products and our revenues may be seriously harmed. The price of our outstanding securities may suffer if we cannot control fluctuations in our sales and operating results. Historically, our quarterly and annual sales and operating results have fluctuated. We expect fluctuations to continue in the future. In addition to general economic and political conditions, the following factors affect our sales: the timing of significant customer orders, our inability to forecast future sales due to our just-in-time supply approach, changes in competitive pricing, wide variations in profitability by product line, variations in operating expenses, the timing of announcements or introductions of new products by us, our competitors or our respective customers, the acceptance of those products, relative variations in manufacturing efficiencies and costs, and the relative strength or weakness of international markets. Since our quarterly and annual sales and operating results vary, we believe that period-to-period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful, and you should not rely on those comparisons as indicators of our future performance. Due to the foregoing factors, it is possible that in some future quarter or quarters our revenues or operating results will not meet the expectations of the public stock market analysts or investors, which could cause the price of our outstanding securities to decline. If we cannot continue to attract and retain highly-qualified people, our revenues, gross margin and income may suffer. We believe that our future success significantly depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified management, technical and marketing personnel. The competition for these individuals is intense. From time to time, there may be a shortage of skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees. We believe our inability to do so could negatively impact the demand for our products and services and consequently our financial condition and operating results. 15 Table of Contents Our costs and business prospects may be affected by increased government regulation, a factor which is largely beyond our control. We are not directly regulated in the United States, but many of our U.S. customers and the telecommunications industry generally are subject to Federal Communications Commission regulation. In overseas markets, there are generally similar governmental agencies that regulate our customers. We believe that regulatory changes could have a significant negative effect on our business and operating results by restricting our customers development efforts, making current products obsolete or increasing competition. Our customers must obtain regulatory approvals to operate certain of our products. Any failure or delay by any of our customers to obtain these approvals would adversely impact our ability to sell our products. The enactment by governments of new laws or regulations or a change in the interpretation of existing regulations could adversely affect the market for our products. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for such products, generally following extensive investigation and deliberation over competing technologies. In the past, the delays inherent in this governmental approval process have caused, and may in the future cause, the cancellation or postponement of the deployment of new technologies. These delays could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, gross margins and income. Allegations of health risks from wireless equipment may negatively affect our results of operations. Allegations of health risks from the electromagnetic fields generated by base stations and mobile handsets, and the lawsuits and publicity relating to them, regardless of merit, could affect our operations negatively by leading consumers to reduce their use of mobile phones or by causing us to allocate resources to these issues. The price of our common stock historically has been volatile. The market price of our common stock historically has experienced and may continue to experience high volatility, and the broader stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years. Some of the factors that can affect our stock price are: actual, or market expectations of, fluctuations in capital spending by wireless operators and original equipment manufacturers on wireless infrastructure; the announcement of new products, services or technological innovations by us or our competitors; continued variability in our revenue or earnings; changes in quarterly revenue or earnings estimates for us made by the investment community; delays or postponements of wireless infrastructure deployments, including 3G technology, regardless of whether such deployments have an actual impact on our orders or sales; and speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business or significant transactions. General market conditions and domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance may also affect the price of our common stock. For these reasons, investors should not rely on historical trends to predict future stock prices or financial results. In addition, following periods of volatility in a companys securities, securities class action litigation against a company is sometimes instituted. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources. We anticipate that we will continue to face these types of risks. Beginning in 2003, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act) has required the company to comply with numerous provisions focused on upgraded disclosures and corporate governance, increasing the companys cost and complexity of being a public company. Beginning in 2005, Section 404 of the Act required that the company include an internal control report of management in its annual report on Form 10-K. The internal control report must contain (1) a statement of managements responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, (2) a statement identifying the framework used by management to conduct the required evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, (3) managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its most recent fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not internal control over financial reporting is effective, and (4) a statement that the companys independent auditors have issued an attestation report on managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting. Management acknowledges its responsibility for internal controls over financial reporting and seeks to continually improve those controls. The company believes its process for documenting, evaluating and monitoring its internal control over financial reporting is consistent with the objectives of Section 404 of the Act. In 2005, two material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting were identified as described in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Management has established procedures to remediate these material weaknesses and the company devotes significant resources maintaining its system of internal controls. We believe the inability to implement and maintain adequate internal controls and to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in future periods could negatively impact investor confidence and the companys stock price. 16 Table of Contents We plan to move our Orland Park, Illinois corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility. On August 29, 2005, we entered into a contract to sell our Orland Park, IL manufacturing and corporate headquarters site for approximately $26 million. This transaction is expected to close in two phases over approximately an eighteen-month period. We will relocate our corporate headquarters to a leased facility in Westchester, IL during the second quarter of fiscal 2006. We also plan to construct a state-of-the-art manufacturing and office facility in Joliet, IL., and expect construction to be completed in 2007. In order to avoid customer-related disruptions, the company will have a detailed plan to transition administrative and manufacturing operations to these new facilities. However, due to the scope and nature of the move, customer shipments could be affected, which could have an adverse financial result. The Chinese government could delay issuance of anticipated new wireless network licenses. The Chinese government is planning to issue licenses for its next generation wireless network. The new Chinese network will become the technical standard with which wireless infrastructure will be designed, manufactured and deployed in China. It is anticipated that these licenses will be issued during calendar year 2006. Additionally, we anticipate an increase in wireless infrastructure spending associated with the buildout of the anticipated, new network. Significant delays of license issuance could adversely affect the companys financial results. Compliance with European Union environmental directives could be difficult and costly for the company. The European Union has issued directives governing the design of energy-using products, the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances and the waste (disposal) of electrical and electronic equipment. These directives require companies to change the way they design, manufacture, track and bring new products into the market. Certain products we manufacture and distribute throughout the European Union will need to comply with these directives. If we are not able to comply with these directives, customer shipments and financial results may be adversely affected. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None 17 Table of Contents
