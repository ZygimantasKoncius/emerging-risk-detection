ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There are several risks inherent in our business including, but not limited to, the following: Following the Cash Security Business Sale, the Company has no operations. Following the consummation of the ATM Business Sale on January 3, 2006 and the closing of the Cash Security Business Sale on October 2, 2006, we have substantially no operations and no employees. 7 Table of Contents We may be unable to sell debt or equity securities in the event we need additional funds for operations. We may need to sell equity or debt securities in the future to provide working capital for our operations or to provide funds in the event of future operating losses. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in raising additional funds. We have no commitments, agreements or understandings regarding additional financings at this time, and we may be unable to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms or at all. If we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, our current shareholders could be substantially diluted and those additional securities could have preferences and privileges that current shareholders do not have. We have limited management and other resources. Our ability to manage any future operations effectively will require us to hire new employees, to integrate new management and employees into any future operations, financial and management systems, controls and facilities. Our failure to handle the issues we face effectively, including any failure to integrate new management controls, systems and procedures, could materially adversely affect our company, results of operations and financial condition.
