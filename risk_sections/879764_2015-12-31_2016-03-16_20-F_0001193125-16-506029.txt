risk factors are continually assessed in TOTALs management and risk management plans. The Group believes that it is impossible to guarantee that the contingencies or liabilities related to the matters mentioned above will not have a material adverse impact in the future on its business, assets and liabilities, consolidated financial situation, cash flow or income. Disruption to or breaches of TOTALs critical IT services or information security systems could adversely affect the Groups operations. The Groups activities depend heavily on the reliability and security of its information technology (IT) systems. If the integrity of its IT systems were compromised due to, for example, technical failure, cyber attack, computer intrusions and viruses, power or network outages or natural disasters, the Groups activities and assets could sustain serious damage, material intellectual property could be divulged and, in some cases, personal injury, environmental harm and regulatory violations could occur, potentially having a material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition, including its results. The Groups production growth and profitability depend on the delivery of its major development projects. Growth of production and profitability of the Group rely heavily on the successful execution of its major development projects that are increasingly complex and capital-intensive. These major projects are subject to a number of challenges, including, in particular, those related to:  negotiations with partners, governments, suppliers, customers and others;  obtaining project financing;  controlling operating costs;  earning an adequate return in a low oil price environment;  adhering to projects schedules; and  the timely issuance or renewal of permits and licenses by government agencies. Poor delivery of any major project that underpins production or production growth could adversely affect the Groups financial performance. The Groups long-term profitability depends on cost-effective discovery, acquisition and development of economically viable new reserves; if the Group is unsuccessful, its operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. A large portion of the Groups revenues and operating results are derived from the sale of oil and gas that the Group extracts from underground reserves developed as part of its exploration and production activities. The development of oil and gas fields, the construction of facilities and the drilling of production or injection wells is capital intensive and requires advanced technology. Due to constantly changing market conditions and environmental challenges, cost projections can be uncertain. For the Upstream segment to continue to be profitable, the Group needs to replace its reserves with new proved reserves that can be developed and produced in an economically viable manner. In addition, TOTALs ability to discover or acquire and develop new reserves successfully is uncertain and can be negatively affected by a number of factors, including:  the geological nature of oil and gas fields, notably unexpected drilling conditions including pressure or unexpected heterogeneities in geological formations;  the risk of dry holes or failure to find expected commercial quantities of hydrocarbons;  the inability of service companies to deliver on contracted services on time and on budget;  the inability of the Groups partners to execute or finance projects in which the Group holds an interest;  equipment failures, fires, blow-outs or accidents;  the Groups inability to develop or implement new technologies that enable access to previously inaccessible fields; (1) Company data. (2) Backloading: authorization given to the European Commission to intervene at its own discretion in the CO2 allowance auction calendar. 2015 Form 20-F TOTAL S.A. 5 Item 3 - C. Risk Factors  the Groups inability to anticipate market changes in a timely manner;  adverse weather conditions;  compliance with both anticipated and unanticipated governmental requirements, including U.S. and EU regulations that may give a competitive advantage to companies not subject to such regulations;  shortages or delays in the availability or delivery of appropriate equipment;  industrial action;  competition from oil and gas companies for the acquisition and development of assets and licenses;  increased taxes and royalties, including retroactive claims; and  disputes related to property titles. These factors could lead to cost overruns and could impair the Groups ability to complete a development project or make production economical. Some of these factors may also affect the Groups projects and facilities further down the oil and gas chain. If TOTAL fails to develop new reserves cost-effectively in sufficient quantities to replace the Groups reserves currently being developed, produced and marketed, the Groups financial condition, including its results, would be materially and adversely affected. The Groups oil and gas reserves data are estimates only and subsequent downward adjustments are possible. If actual production from such reserves proves to be lower than current estimates indicate, the Groups operating results and financial condition would be negatively impacted. The Groups proved reserves figures are estimates prepared in accordance with SEC rules. Proved reserves are those reserves which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically recoverable  from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations  prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Reserves are estimated by teams of qualified, experienced and trained geoscientists, petroleum engineers and project engineers, who rigorously review and analyze in detail all available geoscience and engineering data (e.g., seismic data, electrical logs, cores, fluids, pressures, flow rates, facilities parameters). This process involves making subjective judgments, including with respect to the estimate of hydrocarbons initially in place, initial production rates and recovery efficiency, based on available geological, technical and economic data. Consequently, estimates of reserves are not exact measurements and are subject to revision. A variety of factors that are beyond the Groups control could cause such estimates to be adjusted downward in the future, or cause the Groups actual production to be lower than its currently reported proved reserves indicate. These main such factors include:  a decline in the price of oil or gas, making reserves no longer economically viable to exploit and therefore not classifiable as proved;  an increase in the price of oil or gas, which may reduce the reserves to which the Group is entitled under production sharing and risked service contracts and other contractual terms;  changes in tax rules and other government regulations that make reserves no longer economically viable to exploit; and  the actual production performance of the Groups deposits. The Groups reserves estimates may therefore require substantial downward revisions should its subjective judgments prove not to have been conservative enough based on the available geoscience and engineering data, or the Groups assumptions regarding factors or variables that are beyond its control prove to be incorrect over time. Any downward adjustment would indicate lower future production amounts, which could adversely affect the Groups financial condition, including its results. Many of the Groups projects are conducted by equity affiliates or are operated by third parties. For these projects, the Groups degree of control, as well as its ability to identify and manage risks, may be reduced. A significant number of the Groups projects is conducted by equity affiliates. In cases where the Groups company is not the operator, such company may have limited influence over, and control of, the behavior, performance and costs of the partnership, its ability to manage risks may be limited and it may, nevertheless, be prosecuted by regulators or claimants in the event of an incident. For additional information concerning equity affiliates, refer to Note 12 (Equity affiliates: investments and loans) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, the partners of the Group may not be able to meet their financial or other obligations to the projects, which may threaten the viability of a given project. These partners may also not have the financial capacity to fully indemnify the Group in the event of an incident. Contracts signed by the Groups entities may provide for indemnification obligations either by TOTAL in favor of the contractor or third parties or by the contractor or third parties in favor of TOTAL if, for example, an event occurs leading to death, personal injury or property or environmental damage. With respect to joint ventures, contractual terms generally provide that the operator, whether an entity of the Group or a third party, assumes full liability for damages caused by its gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the absence of the operators gross negligence or willful misconduct, other liabilities are generally borne by the joint venture and the cost thereof is assumed by the partners of the joint venture in proportion to their respective ownership interests. With respect to third-party providers of goods and services, the amount and nature of the liability assumed by the third party depends on the context and may be limited by contract. With respect to their customers, the Groups entities ensure that their products meet applicable specifications and abide by all applicable consumer protection laws. Failure to do so could lead to personal injury, environmental harm and loss of customers, which could negatively impact the Groups financial condition and reputation. 6 TOTAL S.A. Form 20-F 2015 Item 3 - C. Risk Factors TOTAL has significant production and reserves located in politically, economically and socially unstable areas, where the likelihood of material disruption of the Groups operations is relatively high. A significant portion of TOTALs oil and gas production and reserves is located in countries outside of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In recent years, a number of these countries have experienced varying degrees of one or more of the following: economic instability, political volatility, civil war, violent conflict, social unrest, actions of terrorist groups and the application of international economic sanctions. Any of these conditions alone or in combination could disrupt the Groups operations in any of these regions, causing substantial declines in production or revisions to reserves estimates. In Africa, which represented 29% of the Groups 2015 combined liquids and gas production, certain of the countries in which the Group has production have recently suffered from some of these conditions, including Nigeria, which is one of the main contributing countries to the Groups production of hydrocarbons, and Libya. The Middle East, which represented 21% of the Groups 2015 combined liquids and gas production, has in recent years suffered increased political volatility in connection with violent conflict and social unrest, including Syria, where European Union (EU) and U.S. economic sanctions have prohibited TOTAL from producing oil and gas since 2011. In Yemen, the deterioration of security conditions in the vicinity of Balhaf have lead the company Yemen LNG, in which the Group holds a stake of 39.62%, to stop its commercial production and export of LNG and to declare force majeure to its various stakeholders. In South America, which represented 6% of the Groups 2015, combined liquids and gas production, certain of the countries in which TOTAL has production have recently suffered from some of the above-mentioned conditions, including Argentina and Venezuela. In Russia, where, as of December 31, 2015, the Group held 19% of its proved reserves, members of the international community have, since July 2014, adopted economic sanctions against certain Russian persons and entities, including various entities operating in the financial, energy and defense sectors, in response to the situation in Ukraine (for additional information, refer to the risk factor on economic sanctions, below). Furthermore, in addition to current production, TOTAL is also exploring for and developing new reserves in other regions of the world that are historically characterized by political, social and economic instability, such as the Caspian Sea region where TOTAL has large projects currently underway. The occurrence and magnitude of incidents related to economic, social and political instability are unpredictable. It is possible that they could have a material adverse impact on the Groups production and operations in the future and/or cause certain investors to reduce their holdings of TOTALs securities. TOTAL, like other major international energy companies, has a geographically diverse portfolio of reserves and operational sites, which allows it to conduct its business and financial affairs so as to reduce its exposure to political and economic risks. However, there can be no assurance that such events will not have a material adverse impact on the Group. Intervention by host country authorities can adversely effect the Groups activities and its operating results. TOTAL has significant exploration and production activities, and in some cases refining, marketing or chemicals operations, in countries whose governmental and regulatory framework is subject to unexpected change and where the enforcement of contractual rights is uncertain. The legal framework of TOTALs exploration and production activities, established through concessions, licenses, permits and contracts granted by or entered into with a government entity, a state-owned company or, sometimes, private owners, is subject to risks of renegotiation that, in certain cases, can reduce or challenge the protections offered by the initial legal framework. In addition, the Groups exploration and production activities in such countries are often undertaken in conjunction with state-owned entities, for example as part of a joint venture where the state has a significant degree of control. In recent years, in various regions globally, TOTAL has observed governments and state-owned enterprises impose more stringent conditions on companies pursuing exploration and production activities in their respective countries, increasing the costs and uncertainties of the Groups business operations, which is a trend TOTAL expects to continue. Potential increasing intervention by governments in such countries can take a wide variety of forms, including:  the award or denial of exploration and production interests;  the imposition of specific drilling obligations;  price and/or production quota controls and export limits;  nationalization or expropriation of assets;  unilateral cancellation or modification of license or contract rights;  increases in taxes and royalties, including retroactive claims;  the renegotiation of contracts;  the imposition of increased local content requirements;  payment delays; and  currency exchange restrictions or currency devaluation. Imposition of any of these factors by a host government where TOTAL has substantial operations, including exploration, could cause the Group to incur material costs or cause the Groups production or value of the Groups assets to decrease, which could potentially have a material adverse effect on its results. For example, the Nigerian government has been contemplating new legislation to govern the petroleum industry which, if passed into law, could have an impact on the existing and future activities of the Group in that country through increased taxes and/or operating costs and could adversely affect financial returns from projects in that country. The Group operates in a highly competitive environment. Its competitiveness could be adversely impacted if the Groups level of innovation lagged behind its competitors. TOTALs main competitors are comprised of national and international oil companies. The evolution of the energy sector has opened the door to new competitors and increased market price volatility. TOTAL is subject to competition in the acquisition of assets and licenses for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas as well as for the sale of manufactured products based on crude and refined oil. In the gas sector, major producers increasingly compete in the downstream value chain with established distribution companies, including those that belong to the Group. Increased competitive pressure could have a significant negative effect on the prices, margins and market shares of the Groups companies. The pursuit of unconventional gas development, particularly in the United States, has contributed to falling market prices and a marked difference between spot and long-term contract prices. The competitiveness of long-term contracts indexed to oil prices could be affected if this discrepancy persists and if it should prove difficult to invoke price revision clauses. 2015 Form 20-F TOTAL S.A. 7 Item 3 - C. Risk Factors The Groups activities are carried out in a constantly changing environment with new products and technologies continuously emerging. The Group may not be able to anticipate these changes, identify and integrate technological developments in order to maintain its competitiveness, maintain a high level of performance and operational excellence, and best meet the needs and demands of its customers. The Groups innovation policy requires significant investment, notably in R&D, of which the expected impact cannot be guaranteed. Ethical misconduct or breaches of applicable laws by employees of the Group could expose TOTAL to criminal and civil penalties and be damaging to TOTALs reputation and shareholder value. The Groups Code of Conduct, which applies to all of its employees, defines TOTALs commitment to business integrity and compliance with all applicable legal requirements and high ethical standards. This commitment is supported by a zero tolerance principle. Ethical misconduct or non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations by TOTAL or any third party acting on its behalf could expose TOTAL and/or its employees to criminal and civil penalties and could be damaging to TOTALs reputation and shareholder value. In addition, such misconduct or non-compliance may lead the competent authorities to impose other measures, such as the appointment of an independent monitor in charge of assessing the Groups compliance and internal control procedures and, if need be, recommending improvements. For an overview of the settlements between TOTAL, the SEC and the Department of Justice (DoJ) providing for the appointment of an independent monitor, refer to Item 4  E. Other Matters  4.3.7.1. Preventing corruption and Item 8  4. Legal or arbitration proceedings  Iran. With respect to competition laws, which apply to the Groups companies in the vast majority of countries in which it does business, non-compliance may result in substantial fines and expose the Group and its employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits. Generally, entities of the Group could potentially be subject to administrative, judicial or arbitration proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on the Group or its financial situation. TOTAL has activities in certain countries targeted by economic sanctions. If the Groups activities are not conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, TOTAL could be sanctioned or otherwise penalized. Various members of the international community have targeted certain countries, including Iran, Syria and Russia, with economic sanctions and other restrictive measures. U.S. and European restrictions relevant to the Group and certain disclosure concerning the Groups limited activities or presence in certain targeted countries are outlined below and in Item 4  E. Other Matters  5. Information concerning certain limited activities in Iran and Syria, respectively. TOTAL continues to closely monitor the possible impacts of international economic sanctions regimes on its activities. The Group does not believe that its activities in targeted countries are in violation of applicable international economic sanctions administered by the United States, the European Union (EU) and other members of the international community. However, the Group cannot assure that current or future regulations or developments related to economic sanctions will not have a negative impact on its business or reputation. A violation by the Group of applicable laws or regulations could result in criminal, civil and/or material financial penalties. - Restrictions against Iran With respect to Iran, the United States has adopted a number of measures since 1996 that provide for the possible imposition of sanctions against non-U.S. companies engaged in certain activities in and with Iran. Pursuant to the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA), which has been amended and expanded on several occasions since 1996, including by the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act of 2010 (CISADA), the President of the United States is authorized to initiate an investigation into the activities of non-U.S. companies in Irans energy sector and to impose sanctions against persons found, amongst other activities, to have knowingly made investments of $20 million or more in Irans petroleum sector in any 12-month period. In May 1998, the U.S. government waived the application of ISA sanctions for TOTALs past investments in the South Pars gas field. This waiver, which has not been modified since it was granted, does not address any of TOTALs other activities in Iran. Excluding the investments made as part of the development of South Pars, TOTAL made investments in Iran in excess of $20 million in each of the years between 1996 and 2007.These investments are not sanctionable by the U.S. authorities pursuant to a determination made by the U.S. Department of State on September 30, 2010, under the Special Rule provision of ISA that allows it to avoid making a determination of sanctionability with respect to any party that provides certain assurances. The U.S. Department of State further indicated that, so long as TOTAL acts in accordance with its commitments, it will not be regarded as a company of concern for its past Iran-related activities. Since 2008, TOTALs position in Iran essentially has consisted of being reimbursed for its past investments as part of buyback contracts signed between 1995 and 1999 with respect to permits on which the Group is no longer the operator. Since 2011, TOTAL has had no production in Iran. Furthermore, since the applicability of the Special Rule to TOTAL was announced by the U.S. State Department, the United States imposed a number of additional restrictive measures targeting activities in Iran. TOTAL does not conduct activities that it believes would be sanctionable under these measures. Many U.S. states have adopted legislation with respect to Iran requiring, in certain conditions, state pension funds to divest themselves of securities in any company with active business operations in Iran and state contracts not to be awarded to such companies. State regulators have adopted similar initiatives relating to investments by insurance companies. If TOTALs presence in Iran were determined to fall within the prohibited scope of these laws, and TOTAL were not to qualify for any available exemptions, certain U.S. institutions holding interests in TOTAL may be required to sell their interests. If significant, sales of securities resulting from such laws and/or regulatory initiatives could have an adverse effect on the prices of TOTALs securities. The EU has also adopted sanctions regimes with regard to Iran, including a set of restrictive measures adopted in July and October 2010 that prohibited, among other things, the supply of key equipment and technology in the refining, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and oil and gas exploration and production sectors in Iran, as well as technical assistance, training and financial assistance in connection with such items. Extension of loans or credit to, acquisition of shares in, entry into joint ventures with or other participation in enterprises in Iran (or Iranian-owned enterprises outside of Iran) engaged in any of the targeted sectors also is prohibited. Moreover, with respect to restrictions on transfers of funds and on financial services, any transfer of at least €400,000 8 TOTAL S.A. Form 20-F 2015 Items 3 - 4 or equivalent to or from an Iranian individual or entity shall require a prior authorization of the competent authorities of the EU Member States. TOTAL conducts its activities in compliance with these EU measures. On January 23, 2012, the Council of the EU prohibited the purchase, import and transport of Iranian oil and petroleum and petrochemical products by European persons and by entities constituted under the laws of an EU Member State. Prior to that date, TOTAL had ceased these activities. On July 14, 2015, the EU, the P5+1 countries (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany) and Iran reached an agreement called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the JCPOA) regarding limits on Irans nuclear activities and relief under certain U.S., EU and UN sanctions regarding Iran. On January 16, 2016, in recognition of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) having verified that Iran has met its initial nuclear compliance commitments under the JCPOA, EU and UN and secondary U.S. (i.e., those covering non-U.S. persons) economic and financial sanctions were suspended, but they could be re-imposed if there is a dispute over Irans compliance with its nuclear commitments. TOTAL is closely monitoring developments in this regard. - Restrictions against Syria With respect to Syria, the EU adopted measures in May 2011 that prohibit the supply of certain equipment to this country, as well as certain financial and asset transactions with respect to a list of named individuals and entities. These measures apply to European persons and to entities constituted under the laws of an EU Member State. In September 2011, the EU adopted further measures, including, notably, a prohibition on the purchase, import or transportation from Syria of crude oil and petroleum products. Since early September 2011, the Group ceased to purchase hydrocarbons from Syria. On December 1, 2011, the EU extended sanctions against, among others, three state-owned Syrian oil firms, including General Petroleum Corporation, TOTALs co-contracting partner in the production sharing agreement signed in 1988 (Deir Ez Zor licence) and the Tabiyeh contract. The United States also has various measures regarding Syria. Since early December 2011, the Group has ceased its activities that contributed to oil and gas production in Syria. - Restrictions against Russia Since July 2014, members of the international community have adopted economic sanctions against certain Russian persons and entities, including various entities operating in the financial, energy and defense sectors, in response to the situation in Ukraine. Among other things, the United States has adopted economic sanctions targeting OAO Novatek(1) (Novatek), as well as entities in which Novatek (individually or with other similarly targeted persons or entities collectively) owns an interest of at least 50%, including OAO Yamal LNG(2) (Yamal LNG). These sanctions prohibit U.S. persons from transacting in, providing financing for or otherwise dealing in debt issued by these entities after July 16, 2014 of greater than 90 days maturity. Consequently, the use of the U.S. dollar for such financing, including for Yamal LNG, is effectively prohibited. As a result, the financing plan for the Yamal LNG project is being reviewed, and the projects partners are engaged in efforts to develop a financing plan in compliance with the applicable regulations. The economic sanctions initially adopted by the European Union in 2014 and subsequently extended do not materially affect TOTALs activities in Russia. TOTAL has been formally authorized to continue all its activities in Russia (in the Kharyaga field as operator, and in the Termokarstovoye field and Yamal project in which the Group holds interests) by the French government, which is the competent authority for granting authorization under the EU sanctions regime. TOTALs activities in Russia are also not materially affected by restrictive measures adopted by the United States in August 2015 imposing export controls and restrictions relating to the export of certain goods, services, and technologies destined for projects located in Russia in the field of oil exploration. With respect to the exploration project in the Bazhenov play (tight oil) in western Siberia, which has been suspended since 2014, TOTAL signed in July 2015 an agreement to transfer the exploration licenses it held in this play to OAO Lukoil. This agreement also sets out the conditions under which TOTAL and OAO Lukoil could potentially resume their joint activities in Russia. In January 2016, TOTAL signed an agreement to sell 50% of its interest in the Kharyaga field and transfer the operatorship to Zarubezhneft. After the sale, which is expected to be completed in 2016, TOTALs interest in the Kharyaga field will be 20%. TOTAL continues to closely monitor the different international economic sanctions with respect to its activities in Russia. As of December 31, 2015, the Group held 19% of its proved reserves in Russia.
