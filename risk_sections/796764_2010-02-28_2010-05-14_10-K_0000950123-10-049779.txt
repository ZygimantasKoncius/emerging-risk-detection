ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS If any of the risks or uncertainties discussed below and elsewhere in this report, including, but not limited to, the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report, were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we presently deem to be immaterial could also seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our Board of Directors and management team have recently changed, and our failure to successfully adapt to these changes, a failure by our new management team to successfully manage our operations, and/or our inability to fill vacant key management positions may adversely affect our business. Six new directors were appointed to our Board of Directors during 2009. In addition, the Board of Directors appointed Christopher J. Davino as our President and Chief Executive Officer and John A. Stone as our Chief Financial Officer during 2009. These transitions could create uncertainty among our employees, customers, partners and promoters and could result in changes to the strategic direction of our business, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial position. Any failure of our management to work together to effectively manage our operations, our inability to hire other key management, and any failure to effectively integrate our new management into our controls, systems and procedures may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We believe that our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills and efforts of our new management team. If we lose the services of any of our current senior executive officers and key employees, our ability to achieve our business objectives could be seriously harmed, in turn adversely affecting our business and operating results. 6 Table of Contents The current economic slowdown and disruptions in the financial markets may have a negative impact on our revenues and make it difficult for us to obtain financing to operate our business. Our results of operations are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending for our exhibitions, both domestically and in international markets where we operate. Discretionary consumer spending is impacted by higher levels of unemployment, fuel prices, weakness in the housing markets, higher consumer debt levels, declines in consumer confidence in future economic conditions, higher tax rates, higher interest rates, and other adverse economic conditions. The economic slowdown, and other factors that cause consumers to reduce their discretionary spending to a point where attendance at our exhibitions declines, negatively affect our revenues and results of operations. The current economic weakness that continues in the financial markets and in the housing markets has resulted in declines in consumer confidence and spending, extreme volatility in securities prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability and declining valuations of many investments. If the national or global economy or credit market conditions in general were to deteriorate further in the future, it is possible that such changes could put additional negative pressure on discretionary consumer spending and other consumer purchasing habits, which would adversely affect our operating results and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing to operate our business. Our cash flows from operations may not improve sufficiently to finance our ongoing operations or to make investments necessary for future growth without the need for additional financing. We can provide no assurances that our cash flow from operations will improve sufficiently to finance our ongoing operations or to make investments necessary for future growth. During fiscal 2010, we incurred a net loss of $20 million including a net loss of $11.5 million in the fourth quarter. Our cash balance was approximately $10.2 million as of February 28, 2010. As of February 28, 2010, we do not have access to a revolving credit facility, due to our recent financial performance. On May 6, 2009, we executed an agreement to receive $12 million in financing from Sellers Capital Master Fund, Ltd., our largest shareholder. Due to this financing, we believe we will have sufficient funds to continue operations during the current fiscal year and we currently expect that our cash flows from operations will improve during that period. However, there can be no assurance that our cash flows from operations will improve sufficiently during the next 12 months to fund our ongoing operations beyond that time. We might need to raise additional financing, which might not be available to us or might only be available to us on terms that are not favorable, if market conditions do not improve. If we are unable to sufficiently improve our financial performance or obtain financing, if and when we may need it, we may not be able to continue operations. For more information, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7 of Part II of this report. Our inability to develop new exhibitions could seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition. Our business depends on our ability to develop and execute new exhibitions and new venues for our existing exhibitions. If we are unable to develop new lines of exhibitions and new venues for our existing exhibitions, our results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed. Our exhibition business is sensitive to public tastes. If we are unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences, demand for our exhibitions could decrease. Our ability to generate revenue from our exhibitions is highly sensitive to changes in public tastes. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and to offer appealing exhibitions. We typically book each exhibition venue several months in advance of an exhibitions opening and incur certain upfront costs prior to our receiving any operating income. Therefore, if the public is not receptive to a particular exhibition or location, we could incur a loss depending on the amount of the incurred costs. Moreover, if we are not able to anticipate, identify or react to changes in public tastes, reduced demand for our exhibitions will likely result. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. If our advertising, promotional and other marketing campaigns are not successful, our results of operations could be harmed. Like many other companies that make entertainment available to the public, we utilize significant resources to advertise, promote and provide marketing support for our exhibitions. For the periods ending fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009, and February 29, 2008 (fiscal 2008), we incurred marketing and advertising expenses of $4.2 million, $6.0 million, and $5.7 million, respectively. We are also party to agreements pursuant to which we engage third-parties to assist us in the production, design, promotion and marketing of our exhibitions. If our advertising, promotional and other marketing campaigns are not successful, or if we are not able to continue to secure on commercially reasonable terms the assistance of third-parties in our marketing and promotional activities, our results of operations will be harmed. 7 Table of Contents Events harming our reputation could adversely affect our business prospects, financial results and stock price. We are dependent on our reputation. Events that can damage our reputation include, but are not limited to, legal violations, actual or perceived ethical problems, particularly related to our human anatomy exhibitions, actual or perceived poor employee relations, actual or perceived poor customer service, venue appearance or operational issues, or events outside of our control that generate negative publicity with respect to our company. Any event that has the potential to negatively impact our reputation could negatively affect our business prospects, financial results and stock price. We are dependent upon our ability to lease exhibition venues. If we are unable to lease exhibition venues on acceptable terms, our results of operations could be adversely affected. We require access to exhibition venues owned or leased by third parties to conduct our exhibitions. Our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to utilize such venues on commercially reasonable terms. Our ability to obtain new venue locations on favorable terms and in desirable locations depends on a number of other factors, many of which are also beyond our control, including but not limited to, international, national and local business conditions as well as competition from other promoters and exhibitions. If we are not able to secure exhibition locations on commercially reasonable terms and in desirable locations, our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. We may not be granted a salvage award that is commensurate with the efforts we have expended to recover items from the Titanic wreck site or may be prohibited from exhibiting certain of the Titanic artifacts already under our control. In November 2007, we filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division seeking an interim salvage award to compensate us for our efforts in recovering certain items from the wreck of the Titanic. Although the Court has not yet ruled on our motion for an interim salvage award, the court previously suggested that it would likely not give us title to certain of the artifacts. As a result, the outcome of the motion is uncertain. It is possible that we may not be granted a salvage award that is commensurate with our recovery efforts. It is also possible that the court will take possession of certain of the Titanic artifacts we have already recovered, which may make it difficult for us to conduct future Titanic exhibitions in the same manner as we presently conduct such exhibitions. A negative decision by the court on our motion could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct Titanic exhibitions, which could harm our results of operations. If we are unable to maintain our Salvor-in-Possession rights to the Titanic wreck and wreck site, our Titanic exhibitions could face increased competition and we could lose the right to exhibit certain Titanic artifacts. As recently as January 31, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recognized that we are the exclusive Salvor-in-Possession of the Titanic wreck and wreck site. Our Salvor-in-Possession status enables us to prevent third parties from salvaging the Titanic wreck and wreck site and from interfering with our rights to salvage the wreck and wreck site. To maintain our Salvor-in-Possession rights, we must maintain a presence over the wreck site as interpreted by the courts. In addition, we may have to commence legal proceedings against third parties who attempt to violate our rights as Salvor-in-Possession, which may be expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, the court may not continue to recognize us as the sole and exclusive Salvor-in-Possession of the Titanic wreck and wreck site. If we were to lose our Salvor-in-Possession rights, our Titanic exhibitions could be exposed to competition. This would harm our operating results. Our exhibitions are becoming subject to increasing competition that could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Titanic exhibitions. We believe that our Titanic exhibition business is changing. For example, an adverse ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit left us with non-exclusive rights to photograph and film the Titanic wreck site. As a result of this ruling, other companies can now photograph and film the Titanic wreck site, which exposes us to increased competition that could, for example, result in our loss of future exhibitions or other opportunities, such as documentary film rights. Moreover, it is possible that other companies may, albeit in violation of our Salvor-in-Possession rights, attempt to explore the Titanic wreck site in the future. If any of these companies were successful, we would face increased competition as well as increased costs necessary to defend and preserve our rights. Additionally, the availability of remote operated vehicles for charter from third-parties to conduct expeditions may make it easier for others to gain access to the Titanic site in violation of our Salvor-in-Possession rights. New laws and treaties, or new interpretations of existing laws or treaties, could also have a material adverse effect on our Titanic exhibition business. Any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our financial performance. 8 Table of Contents Human anatomy exhibitions. Our human anatomy exhibitions are subject to competition from other existing and potential human anatomy exhibition companies. If a significant number of new human anatomy exhibitions were to enter the same markets in which our exhibitions are offered or are planned to be offered, attendance at our human anatomy exhibitions could decline and our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. Other exhibitions. If we are successful in presenting our new exhibitions, competitors may bring similar exhibitions of their own to the market. To the extent competitors are successful at marketing and promoting competing exhibitions, our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. Through our co-promoters, we conduct exhibitions outside of the United States, which subjects us to additional business risks that could increase our costs and cause our profitability to decline. During fiscal 2010, we derived approximately $4.1 million or 9%, of our net revenue from exhibitions located outside of the U.S., which represents 29% of our total attendance. We intend to continue to pursue international exhibition opportunities. Our international exhibitions are subject to a number of risks, including the following:  changes in foreign regulatory requirements;  difficulties in staffing, training and managing foreign operations;  changing and irregular enforcement of legal regulations; and  political and economic instability. We are also subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could increase our costs and cause our profitability to decline. Our financial arrangements with our foreign vendors have historically been based upon foreign currencies. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which our exhibitions are touring. The U.S. dollar value of our foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations. Significant increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Certain aspects of our operations are subject to governmental regulation, and our failure to comply with any existing or future regulations could seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our exhibitions are subject to federal, state and local laws, both domestically and internationally, governing various matters, such as:  licensing and permitting;  health, safety, environmental and sanitation requirements;  working conditions, labor, minimum wage and hour, citizenship and employment laws; and  sales, use and other taxes and withholding. We cannot predict the extent to which existing or future laws or regulations could impact our operations. Although we generally contract with a third party for various services at our venues, we cannot provide assurances that we or our third-parties are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at all times, that we or our third-parties will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations or that we will not incur liabilities for violations by us or third-parties with which we maintain a relationship. Our failure or the failure of any of our third-parties with which we maintain a relationship to comply with laws and regulations could also cause us to be subject to investigations or governmental actions that could seriously harm our business. 9 Table of Contents Our business may be harmed as a result of litigation. We are a party to several ongoing material legal proceedings. These proceedings are described below in Item 1 of Part II of this report under the heading Legal Proceedings and also in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Part I of this report. Should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of our current legal proceedings, or if successful claims and other actions are brought against us in the future, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed. We may be unable to hire and retain the personnel we need and, as a result, could lose our competitive position. To meet our business objectives, we must continue to attract and retain skilled technical, operational, managerial and sales and marketing personnel. We face significant competition for these skilled professionals from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary personnel, we may be unable to achieve our business objectives and may lose our competitive position, which could harm our business revenue. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and investors in our common stock could see the value of our common stock decline materially. In addition, the recent trading level of our stock could subject us to delisting by NASDAQ. The stock market continues to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. Over the past year this volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. Such changes may occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company, and these fluctuations have and could continue to materially reduce our stock price. Moreover, companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action lawsuits. Any such lawsuit filed against us, regardless of the outcome, could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources, which in turn could seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. During fiscal 2010, our common stock traded at levels below $1.00 per share. Under NASDAQs rules, a listed security is in non-compliance with NASDAQ listing rules if it fails to achieve at least a $1.00 closing bid price for a period of 30 consecutive business days. On September 15, 2009, the Company received a notice of deficiency from the NASDAQ Global Market regarding the Companys non-compliance with the minimum bid price Listing Rules. On October 16, 2009, the NASDAQ Global Market provided the Company with written confirmation of compliance with the minimum bid price Listing Rule after the closing bid price of the Companys common stock reached $1.00 per share or more for ten consecutive business days. For a variety of reasons, it is possible that we could again violate the minimum bid price or other NASDAQ requirements. If our stock is delisted from NASDAQ, interest in and the ability to trade our stock could decline, which could have a negative impact on the market value of our common stock and our ability to raise capital in the future. We may have a risk of collection of our revenue from exhibitions presented by third parties. We rely upon third parties to present some of our exhibitions and in many cases those third parties operate the box office and control the sale of the tickets. As a result, we are subject to the risk that we will be unable to collect our portion of the revenue from the exhibitions presented by third party partners. Where we are unable to collect these revenues in accordance with the terms of the contract, we may incur the cost of litigation to recover the amounts owed to us. ITEM 1B.
