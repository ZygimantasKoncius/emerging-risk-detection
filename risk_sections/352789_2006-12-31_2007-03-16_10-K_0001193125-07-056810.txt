Risk Factors We are subject to risks associated with general economic conditions and consumer confidence. Any disruption in consumer confidence or general economic conditions including those caused by acts of war, natural disasters affecting key suppliers or key facilities, terrorism or other factors could affect our operating results. Significant portions of our sales are generated in Europe and, to a lesser extent, Asia. We invoice the majority of our European customers in Euros and invoice our remaining customers in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar that are not sufficiently hedged by international customers invoiced in U.S. dollars could result in lower sales and have an adverse effect on future operating results. Our management is giving serious attention to possible strategic opportunities to build the business and find synergistic products or services. Potential strategic transactions always involve a heightened risk of legal claims, disruption and unexpected costs. 21 Table of Contents IOMEGA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES ITEM 1B.
