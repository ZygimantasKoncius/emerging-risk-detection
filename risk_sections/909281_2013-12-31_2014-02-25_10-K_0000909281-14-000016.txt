ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur investors should consider the following risks that could affect us and our business. Although we have tried to identify key factors, our investors need to be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our financial performance. Investors should consider carefully the following discussion of risks and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, including “Forward-Looking Statements,” which are included in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.RISKS INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESSMarket volatility and capital availability could affect adversely our business.The capital and global credit markets have experienced volatility and disruption in the past. In many cases during these periods, the capital markets have exerted downward pressure on equity values and reduced the credit capacity for companies. Our ability to grow could be constrained if we do not have regular access to the capital and global credit markets. Similar or more severe levels of global market disruption and volatility may have an adverse affect on us resulting from, but not limited to, disruption of our access to capital and credit markets, difficulty in obtaining financing necessary to expand facilities or acquire assets, increased financing cost and increasingly restrictive covenants.Our operating results may be affected materially and adversely by unfavorable economic and market conditions.Economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in the crude oil and natural gas industry, as well as in the specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our products and services. Our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or 18Table of Contentschanging economic conditions within that region. Volatility in commodity prices may have an impact on many of our customers, which, in turn, could have a negative impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us. If global economic and market conditions (including volatility in commodity markets), or economic conditions in the United States or other key markets, remain uncertain or persist, spread or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.The volatility of natural gas, crude oil and NGL prices could affect adversely our earnings and cash flows.A significant portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of commodities that are received as payment for natural gas gathering and processing services, for the transportation and storage of natural gas, and for the sale of NGL products in our Natural Gas Liquids segment. Commodity prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be so in the future. The prices we receive for our commodities are subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to the following:•overall domestic and global economic conditions;•relatively minor changes in the supply of, and demand for, domestic and foreign energy;•market uncertainty;•the availability and cost of third-party transportation, natural gas processing and NGL fractionation capacity;•the level of consumer product demand and storage inventory levels;•ethane rejection;•geopolitical conditions impacting supply and demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•weather conditions;•domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;•the price and availability of alternative fuels;•speculation in the commodity futures markets;•the price of natural gas, crude oil, NGL and liquefied natural gas imports;•the effect of worldwide energy-conservation measures; and•the impact of new supplies, new pipelines, processing and fractionation facilities on location price differentials. These external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to reliably estimate future prices of commodities and the impact commodity price fluctuations have on our customers and their need for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows. As commodity prices decline, we are paid less for our commodities. NGL volumes could decline if it becomes uneconomical for natural gas processors to recover the ethane component of the natural gas stream as a separate product. In addition, crude oil and natural gas production could also decline due to lower prices.We may not be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to allow us to pay quarterly distributions at current levels after the establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to our affiliates.The amount of cash we can distribute to our unitholders depends principally upon the cash we generate from our operations, which includes activities with our affiliates. Because the cash we generate from operations will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, we may not be able to maintain future quarterly distributions at the current level. Our ability to pay quarterly distributions depends primarily on cash flow, including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings, and not solely on profitability, which is affected by noncash items. As a result, we may pay cash distributions during periods when we record net losses and may be unable to pay cash distributions during periods when we record net income.We do not hedge fully against commodity price changes. This could result in decreased revenues, increased costs and lower margins, adversely affecting our results of operations.Our businesses are exposed to market risk and the impact of market fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices. Our primary commodity price exposures arise from:•the value of the NGLs and natural gas we receive in exchange for the natural gas gathering and processing services we provide;•the differentials between NGL and natural gas prices associated with our keep-whole contracts;•the price differentials between the individual NGL products with respect to our NGL transportation and fractionation agreements;•the location price differentials in the price of natural gas and NGLs with respect to our natural gas and NGL transportation businesses;19Table of Contents•the seasonal price differentials in natural gas and NGL prices related to our storage operations; and•the fuel costs and the value of the retained fuel in-kind in our natural gas pipelines and storage operations.To manage the risk from market fluctuations in natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices, we use physical forward transactions and commodity derivative instruments such as futures contracts and swaps. However, we do not hedge fully against commodity price changes, and we therefore retain some exposure to market risk. Accordingly, any adverse changes to commodity prices could result in decreased revenue and increased costs.Our use of financial instruments and physical forward transactions to hedge market risk may result in reduced income.We utilize financial instruments and physical forward transactions to mitigate our exposure to interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. Hedging instruments that are used to reduce our exposure to interest-rate fluctuations could expose us to risk of financial loss where we have contracted for variable-rate swap instruments to hedge fixed-rate instruments and the variable rate exceeds the fixed rate. In addition, these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive if we had contracted for fixed-rate swap agreements to hedge variable-rate instruments and the variable rate falls below the fixed rate. Hedging arrangements that are used to reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations limit the benefit we would otherwise receive if market prices for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs exceed the stated price in the hedge instrument for these commodities.Demand for natural gas and for certain of ONEOK Partners’ products and services is highly weather sensitive and seasonal.The demand for natural gas and for certain of our products, such as propane, is weather sensitive and seasonal, with a portion of revenues derived from sales for heating during the winter months. Weather conditions influence directly the volume of, among other things, natural gas and propane delivered. Deviations in weather from normal levels and the seasonal nature of certain of our segments can create variations in earnings and short-term cash requirements.Energy efficiency and technological advances may affect the demand for natural gas and affect adversely ONEOK Partners’ operating results.More strict energy-conservation measures in the future or technological advances in heating, including installation of improved insulation and the development of more efficient furnaces, energy generation or other devices could affect adversely ONEOK Partners’ results of operations and cash flows.Changes in interest rates could affect adversely our business.We use both fixed and variable rate debt, and we are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our short-term borrowings. From time to time we use interest-rate derivatives to hedge interest obligations on specific debt issuances, including anticipated debt issuances. These hedges may be ineffective, and our results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be adversely affected by significant fluctuations in interest rates from current levels.Our established risk-management policies and procedures may not be effective, and employees may violate our risk-management policies.We have developed and implemented a comprehensive set of policies and procedures that involve both ONEOK Partners GP senior management and the Audit Committee of ONEOK Partners GP’s Board of Directors to assist us in managing risks. Our risk policies and procedures are intended to align strategies, processes, people, information technology and business knowledge so that risk is managed throughout the organization. As conditions change and become more complex, current risk measures may fail to assess adequately the relevant risk due to changes in the market and the presence of risks previously unknown to us. Additionally, if employees fail to adhere to our policies and procedures or if our policies and procedures are not effective, potentially because of future conditions or risks outside of our control, we may be exposed to greater risk than we had intended. Ineffective risk-management policies and procedures or violation of risk-management policies and procedures could have an adverse effect on our earnings, financial position or cash flows.20Table of ContentsThe adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and increase the working capital requirements to conduct these activities.In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, which provides new statutory and regulatory requirements for certain swap transactions. Certain financial transactions will be required to be cleared on exchanges, and cash collateral will be required for these transactions. However, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for a potential exemption from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users and includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exemption applies to particular derivative transactions and to the parties to those transactions. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act calls for various regulatory agencies, including the SEC and the CFTC, to establish regulations for implementation of many of the provisions of the act.The Dodd-Frank Act represents a far-reaching overhaul of the framework for regulation of United States financial markets. The CFTC has issued final regulations for most of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and we have implemented measures to comply with the regulations that are applicable to our businesses. We expect to participate in financial markets for hedging certain risks inherent in our business, including commodity-price and interest-rate risks. Although the impact to date has not been material, we continue to monitor proposed regulations and the impact the regulations may have on our business and our risk-management strategies in the future.Our inability to develop and execute growth projects and acquire new assets could result in reduced cash distributions to our unitholders.Our primary business objectives are to generate cash flow sufficient to pay quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders and to increase our quarterly cash distributions over time. Our ability to maintain and grow our distributions to unitholders depends on the growth of our existing businesses and strategic acquisitions. If we are unable to implement business development opportunities and finance such activities on economically acceptable terms, our future growth will be limited, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows and, accordingly, result in reduced cash distributions over time.Growing our business by constructing new pipelines and plants or making modifications to our existing facilities subjects us to construction and supply risks should adequate natural gas or NGL supply be unavailable upon completion of the facilities.One of the ways we intend to grow our business is through the construction of new pipelines and new gathering, processing, storage and fractionation facilities and through modifications to our existing pipelines and existing gathering, processing, storage and fractionation facilities. The construction and modification of pipelines and gathering, processing, storage and fractionation facilities may require significant capital expenditures, which may exceed our estimates, and involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political, legal and weather-related uncertainties. Construction projects in our industry may increase demand for labor, materials and rights of way, which may, in turn, affect our costs and schedule. If we undertake these projects, we may not be able to complete them on schedule or at the budgeted cost. Additionally, our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if we build a new pipeline, the construction will occur over an extended period of time, and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project. We may have only limited natural gas or NGL supply committed to these facilities prior to their construction. Additionally, we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which anticipated production growth does not materialize. We may also rely on estimates of proved reserves in our decision to construct new pipelines and facilities, which may prove to be inaccurate because there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough natural gas or NGLs to achieve our expected investment return, which could affect materially and adversely our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We may not be able to make additional strategic acquisitions or investments.Our ability to make strategic acquisitions and investments will depend on: •the extent to which acquisitions and investment opportunities become available; •our success in bidding for the opportunities that do become available; •regulatory approval, if required, of the acquisitions on favorable terms; and •our access to capital, including our ability to use our equity in acquisitions or investments, and the terms upon which we obtain capital.21Table of ContentsIf we are unable to make strategic investments and acquisitions, we may be unable to grow.Acquisitions that appear to be accretive may nevertheless reduce our cash from operations on a per-unit basis.Any acquisition involves potential risks that may include, among other things:•inaccurate assumptions about volumes, revenues and costs, including potential synergies;•an inability to integrate successfully the businesses we acquire;•decrease in our liquidity as a result of our using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance the acquisition;•a significant increase in our interest expense and/or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance the acquisition;•the assumption of unknown liabilities for which we are not indemnified, for which our indemnity is inadequate or for which our insurance policies may exclude from coverage;•an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate the acquired business and assets;•limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;•inaccurate assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;•the diversion of management’s and employees’ attention from other business concerns;•unforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas; •increased regulatory burdens;•customer or key employee losses at an acquired business; and•increased regulatory requirements.If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and investors will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of our resources to future acquisitions.We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, and we lease certain facilities and equipment, which could disrupt our operations.We do not own all of the land on which certain of our pipelines and facilities are located, and we are, therefore, subject to the risk of increased costs to maintain necessary land use. We obtain the rights to construct and operate certain of our pipelines and related facilities on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. Our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts on acceptable terms or increased costs to renew such rights, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions, which could affect materially and adversely our business and for which we may not be adequately insured.Our operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards typically associated with the operation of natural gas and natural gas liquids gathering, transportation and distribution pipelines, storage facilities and processing and fractionation plants. Operating risks include, but are not limited to, leaks, pipeline ruptures, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and the performance of pipeline facilities below expected levels of capacity and efficiency. Other operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions include adverse weather conditions, accidents, explosions, fires, the collision of equipment with our pipeline facilities (for example, this may occur if a third party were to perform excavation or construction work near our facilities) and catastrophic events such as tornados, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods or other similar events beyond our control. It is also possible that our facilities could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism. A casualty occurrence might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage or environmental damage. Liabilities incurred and interruptions to the operations of our pipeline or other facilities caused by such an event could reduce revenues generated by us and increase expenses, thereby impairing our ability to meet our obligations. Insurance proceeds may not be adequate to cover all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost, and we are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our business.As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. Consequently, we may not be able to renew existing insurance policies or purchase other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Further, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur.22Table of ContentsTerrorist attacks directed at our facilities could adversely affect our business.Since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the United States government has issued warnings that energy assets, specifically the nation’s pipeline infrastructure, may be future targets of terrorist organizations. These developments may subject our operations to increased risks. Any future terrorist attack that may target our facilities, those of our customers and, in some cases, those of other pipelines, could have a material adverse effect on our business.Pipeline-integrity programs and repairs may impose significant costs and liabilities.Pursuant to a DOT rule, pipeline operators are required to develop integrity-management programs for intrastate and interstate natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines that could affect high-consequence areas in the event of a release of product. As defined by applicable regulations, high-consequence areas include areas near the route of a pipeline with high population densities, facilities occupied by persons of limited mobility and outdoor or indoor areas where at least twenty people periodically gather. The rule requires operators to identify pipeline segments that could impact a high-consequence area; improve data collection, integration and characterization of threats applicable to each segment and implement preventive and mitigating actions; perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity; and repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary. These testing programs could cause us to incur significant capital and operating expenditures to make repairs or remediate, as well as initiate preventive or mitigating actions that are determined to be necessary.Our operations are subject to federal and state laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.The risk of incurring substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in our business. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into, or otherwise relating to the protection of, the environment. Examples of these laws include:•the Clean Air Act and analogous state laws that impose obligations related to air emissions;•the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws that regulate discharge of wastewater from our facilities to state and federal waters;•the federal CERCLA and analogous state laws that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent waste for disposal;•the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and analogous state laws that impose requirements for the handling and discharge of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities; and•an EPA-issued rule on air-quality standards, known as RICE NESHAP.Various federal and state governmental authorities, including the EPA, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Violators are subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including civil fines, injunctions or both. Joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under the CERCLA, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and analogous state laws for the remediation of contaminated areas.There is an inherent risk of incurring environmental costs and liabilities in our business due to our handling of the products we gather, transport, process and store, air emissions related to our operations, past industry operations and waste disposal practices, some of which may be material. Private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline systems pass, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. Some sites we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing operations, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. In addition, increasingly strict laws, regulations and enforcement policies could increase significantly our compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary, some of which may be material. Additional information is included under Item 1, Business, under “Environmental and Safety Matters” and in Note O of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us. Our business may be affected materially and adversely by increased costs due to stricter pollution-control requirements or liabilities resulting from noncompliance with required operating or other regulatory permits. New environmental regulations might also materially and adversely affect our products and activities, and federal and state agencies could impose additional safety requirements, all of which could affect materially our profitability.23Table of ContentsWe may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.Greenhouse gas emissions originate primarily from combustion engine exhaust, heater exhaust and fugitive methane gas emissions. Various federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide and methane, and the United States Supreme Court has ruled that carbon dioxide is a pollutant subject to regulation by the EPA. In addition, there have been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases.We believe it is likely that future governmental legislation and/or regulation may require us either to limit greenhouse gas emissions from our operations or to purchase allowances for such emissions that are actually attributable to our NGL customers. However, we cannot predict precisely what form these future regulations will take, the stringency of the regulations or when they will become effective. Several legislative bills have been introduced in the United States Congress that would require carbon dioxide emission reductions. Previously considered proposals have included, among other things, limitations on the amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted (so called “caps”) together with systems of permitted emissions allowances. These proposals could require us to reduce emissions, even though the technology is not currently available for efficient reduction, or to purchase allowances for such emissions. Emissions also could be taxed independently of limits.In addition to activities on the federal level, state and regional initiatives could also lead to the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions sooner and/or independent of federal regulation. These regulations could be more stringent than any federal legislation that is adopted.Future legislation and/or regulation designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could make some of our activities uneconomic to maintain or operate. Further, we may not be able to pass on the higher costs to our customers or recover all costs related to complying with greenhouse gas regulatory requirements. Our future results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could be adversely affected if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates or otherwise passed on to our customers.We continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments in this area. Although the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may have a material impact on our operations and rates, we believe it is premature to attempt to quantify the potential costs of the impacts.We may not be able to pass on the higher costs to our customers or recover all costs related to complying with greenhouse gas emission regulatory requirements, which could cause material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change.There is a growing belief that emissions of greenhouse gases may be linked to global climate change. Climate change creates physical and financial risk. Our customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity. For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use. To the extent weather conditions may be affected by climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in more pipelines and other infrastructure to serve increased demand. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition, through decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stresses, including service interruptions. Weather conditions outside of our operating territory could also have an impact on our revenues. Severe weather impacts our operating territories primarily through hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service. We may not be able to pass on the higher costs to our customers or recover all costs related to mitigating these physical risks. To the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of greenhouse gases as a financial risk, this could affect negatively our ability to access capital markets or cause us to receive less favorable terms and conditions in future financings. Our business could be affected by the potential for lawsuits against greenhouse gas emitters, based on links drawn between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.Continued development of new supply sources could impact demand.The discovery of unconventional natural gas production areas nearer to certain of the market areas that we serve may compete with natural gas originating in production areas connected to our systems. For example, the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia and Ohio, may cause natural gas in supply areas connected to our systems to be diverted to markets other than our traditional market areas and may affect capacity utilization adversely on our pipeline systems and our ability to 24Table of Contentsrenew or replace existing contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows. In addition, supply volumes from these nontraditional natural gas production areas may compete with and displace volumes from the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountains and Canadian supply sources in certain of our markets. The displacement of natural gas originating in supply areas connected to our pipeline systems by these new supply sources that are closer to the end-use markets could result in lower transportation revenues, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Increased regulation of exploration and production activities, including hydraulic fracturing, could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new crude oil and natural gas wells, which could adversely impact our revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas and NGLs transported on our or our joint ventures’ natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines.The natural gas industry is increasingly relying on natural gas supplies from unconventional sources, such as shale and tight sands. Natural gas extracted from these sources frequently requires hydraulic fracturing, which involves the pressurized injection of water, sand and chemicals into a geologic formation to stimulate natural gas production. Recently, there have been initiatives at the federal and state levels to regulate or otherwise restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing, and several states have adopted regulations that impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well-completion requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities could impose operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators, which could reduce their production of unprocessed natural gas and, in turn, adversely affect our revenues and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of unprocessed natural gas gathered, treated, processed and transported on our or our joint ventures’ natural gas pipelines, several of which gather unprocessed natural gas from areas in which the use of hydraulic fracturing is prevalent.In the competition for customers, we may have significant levels of uncontracted or discounted capacity on our natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines, processing, fractionation and storage assets.Our natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines, processing, fractionation and storage assets compete with other pipelines, processing, fractionation and storage facilities for natural gas and NGL supply delivered to the markets we serve. As a result of competition, we may have significant levels of uncontracted or discounted capacity on our pipelines, processing, fractionation and in our storage assets, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.If the level of drilling and production in the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountain, Texas and Gulf Coast regions declines substantially near our assets, our volumes and revenues could decline.Our ability to maintain or expand our businesses depends largely on the level of drilling and production by third parties in the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountain, Texas and Gulf Coast regions. Drilling and production are impacted by factors beyond our control, including:•demand and prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•producers’ finding and development costs of reserves;•producers’ desire and ability to obtain necessary permits in a timely and economic manner;•natural gas field characteristics and production performance;•surface access and infrastructure issues; and•capacity constraints on natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids infrastructure from the producing areas and our facilities.If production from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin remains flat or declines and demand for natural gas from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin is greater in market areas other than the Midwestern United States, demand for our interstate transportation services could decrease significantly.We depend on natural gas supply from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin for some of our interstate pipelines, primarily Viking Gas Transmission and our investment in Northern Border Pipeline, that transport Canadian natural gas from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin to the Midwestern United States market area. If demand for natural gas increases in Canada or other markets not served by our pipelines and/or production remains flat or declines, demand for transportation service on our interstate natural gas pipelines could decrease significantly, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.25Table of ContentsMergers among our customers and competitors could result in lower volumes being gathered, processed, fractionated, transported or stored on our assets, thereby reducing the amount of cash we generate.Mergers between our existing customers and our competitors could provide strong economic incentives for the combined entities to utilize their existing gathering, processing, fractionation and/or transportation systems instead of ours in those markets where the systems compete. As a result, we could lose some or all of the volumes and associated revenues from these customers, and we could experience difficulty in replacing those lost volumes and revenues. Because most of our operating costs are fixed, a reduction in volumes could result not only in less revenue but also in a decline in cash flow, which would reduce our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders.Our business is subject to regulatory oversight and potential penalties.The natural gas industry historically has been subject to heavy state and federal regulation that extends to many aspects of our businesses and operations, including:•rates, operating terms and conditions of service;•the types of services we may offer our customers;•construction of new facilities;•the integrity, safety and security of facilities and operations;•acquisition, extension or abandonment of services or facilities;•reporting and information posting requirements;•maintenance of accounts and records; and•relationships with affiliate companies involved in all aspects of the natural gas and energy businesses.Compliance with these requirements can be costly and burdensome. Future changes to laws, regulations and policies in these areas may impair our ability to compete for business or to recover costs and may increase the cost and burden of operations.We cannot guarantee that state or federal regulators will authorize any projects or acquisitions that we may propose in the future. Moreover, there can be no guarantee that, if granted, any such authorizations will be made in a timely manner or will be free from potentially burdensome conditions.Failure to comply with all applicable state or federal statutes, rules and regulations and orders could bring substantial penalties and fines. For example, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has civil penalty authority under the Natural Gas Act to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1.0 million per day for each violation.Finally, we cannot give any assurance regarding future state or federal regulations under which we will operate or the effect such regulations could have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our regulated pipelines’ transportation rates are subject to review and possible adjustment by federal and state regulators.Under the Natural Gas Act, which is applicable to interstate natural gas pipelines, and the Interstate Commerce Act, which is applicable to crude oil and natural gas liquids pipelines, our interstate transportation rates, which are regulated by the FERC, must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory.Shippers may protest our pipeline tariff filings, and the FERC and or state regulatory agency may investigate tariff rates. Further, the FERC may order refunds of amounts collected under newly filed rates that are determined by the FERC to be in excess of a just and reasonable level. In addition, shippers may challenge by complaint the lawfulness of tariff rates that have become final and effective. The FERC and/or state regulatory agencies also may investigate tariff rates absent shipper complaint. Any finding that approved rates exceed a just and reasonable level on the natural gas pipelines would take effect prospectively. In a complaint proceeding challenging natural gas liquids pipeline rates, if the FERC determines existing rates exceed a just and reasonable level, it could require the payment of reparations to complaining shippers for up to two years prior to the complaint. Any such action by the FERC or a comparable action by a state regulatory agency could affect adversely our pipeline businesses’ ability to charge rates that would cover future increases in costs, or even to continue to collect rates that cover current costs, and provide for a reasonable return. We can provide no assurance that our pipeline systems will be able to recover all of their costs through existing or future rates.26Table of ContentsOur regulated pipeline companies have recorded certain assets that may not be recoverable from our customers.Accounting policies for FERC-regulated companies permit certain assets that result from the regulated ratemaking process to be recorded on our balance sheet that could not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulated entities. We consider factors such as regulatory changes and the impact of competition to determine the probability of future recovery of these assets. If we determine future recovery is no longer probable, we would be required to write off the regulatory assets at that time.A shortage of skilled labor may make it difficult for us to maintain labor productivity and competitive costs, which could affect operations and cash flows available for distribution to our unitholders.Our operations require skilled and experienced workers with proficiency in multiple tasks. In recent years, a shortage of workers trained in various skills associated with the midstream energy business has caused us to conduct certain operations without full staff, thus hiring outside resources, which may decrease our productivity and increase our costs. This shortage of trained workers is the result of experienced workers reaching retirement age, and increased competition for workers in certain areas, combined with the difficulty of attracting new workers to the midstream energy industry. This shortage of skilled labor could continue over an extended period. If the shortage of experienced labor continues or worsens, it could have an adverse impact on our labor productivity and costs and our ability to expand production in the event there is an increase in the demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our operations and cash flows available for distribution to our unitholders.We are subject to strict regulations at many of our facilities regarding employee safety, and failure to comply with these regulations could affect adversely our financial results.The workplaces associated with our facilities are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. The failure to comply with OSHA requirements or general industry standards, including keeping adequate records or monitoring occupational exposure to regulated substances, could expose us to civil or criminal liability, enforcement actions, and regulatory fines and penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Measurement adjustments on our pipeline system can be impacted materially by changes in estimation, type of commodity and other factors.Natural gas and natural gas liquids measurement adjustments occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our assets. The quantification and resolution of measurement adjustments are complicated by several factors including: (1) the significant quantities (i.e., thousands) of measurement equipment that we use throughout our natural gas and natural gas liquids systems, primarily around our gathering and processing assets; (2) varying qualities of natural gas in the streams gathered and processed through our systems and the mixed nature of NGLs gathered and fractionated; and (3) variances in measurement that are inherent in metering technologies. Each of these factors may contribute to measurement adjustments that can occur on our systems, which could negatively effect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.A failure in our operational systems or cyber security attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, may affect adversely our financial results.Our businesses are dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. If any of our financial, operational or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be affected adversely. Our financial results could also be affected adversely if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. In addition, dependence upon automated systems may further increase the risk that operational system flaws, employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.Due to increased technology advances, we have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our businesses. We use computer programs to help run our financial and operations organizations, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Any future cyber security attacks that affect our facilities, our customers and any financial data could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. In addition, cyber attacks on our customer and employee data may result in a financial loss and may impact negatively our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational system failure. Any of these occurrences could disrupt one or more of our businesses, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse affect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.27Table of ContentsCyber-attacks against us or others in our industry could result in additional regulations. Current efforts by the federal government, such as the Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity executive order, and any potential future regulations could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs, insurance coverage cost or capital expenditures. We cannot predict the potential impact to our business or the energy industry resulting from additional regulations. We may be unable to cause our joint ventures to take or not to take certain actions unless some or all of our joint-venture participants agree.We participate in several joint ventures. Due to the nature of some of these arrangements, each participant in these joint ventures has made substantial investments in the joint venture and, accordingly, has required that the relevant charter documents contain certain features designed to provide each participant with the opportunity to participate in the management of the joint venture and to protect its investment, as well as any other assets which may be substantially dependent on or otherwise affected by the activities of that joint venture. These participation and protective features customarily include a corporate governance structure that requires at least a majority-in-interest vote to authorize many basic activities and requires a greater voting interest (sometimes up to 100 percent) to authorize more significant activities. Examples of these more significant activities are large expenditures or contractual commitments, the construction or acquisition of assets, borrowing money or otherwise raising capital, transactions with affiliates of a joint venture participant, litigation and transactions not in the ordinary course of business, among others. Thus, without the concurrence of joint-venture participants with enough voting interests, we may be unable to cause any of our joint ventures to take or not to take certain actions, even though those actions may be in the best interest of us or the particular joint venture.Moreover, any joint-venture owner generally may sell, transfer or otherwise modify its ownership interest in a joint venture, whether in a transaction involving third parties or the other joint-venture owners. Any such transaction could result in us being required to partner with different or additional parties.We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers or counterparties, and our credit risk management may not be adequate to protect against such risk.We are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties. Our customers or counterparties may experience deterioration of their financial condition as a result of changing market conditions or financial difficulties that could impact their creditworthiness or ability to pay us for our services. We assess the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties and obtain collateral as we deem appropriate. If we fail to assess adequately the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or counterparties, unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting nonpayment and/or nonperformance could adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, if any of our customers or counterparties file for bankruptcy protection, this could have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.An impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, and equity-method investments could reduce our earnings.Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. GAAP requires us to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the investments we account for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of the equity investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. For example, if natural gas production continues to decline in areas of the Powder River Basin where coal-bed methane is produced, we could be unable to recover the carrying value of our assets and equity investments in these areas. If we determine that an impairment is indicated, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization.We may engage in acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions, the success of which may impact our results of operations.We may engage in acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions. If we are unable to integrate successfully businesses that we acquire with our existing business, our results of operations may be affected materially and adversely. Similarly, we may from time to time divest portions of our business, which may also affect materially and adversely our results of operations.28Table of ContentsRISKS INHERENT IN AN INVESTMENT IN USONEOK’s sale of substantial amounts of common units could reduce the market price of our common units.ONEOK and its affiliates own all of the Class B units, 19.8 million common units and the entire 2 percent general partner interest in us, which together constituted a 41.2 percent ownership interest in us as of December 31, 2013. The Class B units are eligible to convert into common units on a one-for-one basis at ONEOK’s option. ONEOK may, from time to time, sell all or a portion of its common units. Sales of substantial amounts of its common units or other types of units, or the anticipation of such sales, could lower the market price of our common units and may make it more difficult for us to sell our equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.ONEOK could withdraw the waiver of its right to receive on its Class B units 110 percent of the distributions paid with respect to our common units.At a special meeting of the holders of our common units held on May 10, 2007, the proposed amendments to our Partnership Agreement were not approved by the required two-thirds affirmative vote of our outstanding units, excluding the common units and Class B limited partner units held by ONEOK and its affiliates. As a result, effective April 7, 2007, ONEOK, as the sole holder of our Class B limited partner units, became entitled to receive increased quarterly distributions on its Class B units equal to 110 percent of the distributions paid with respect to our common units.On June 21, 2007, ONEOK waived its right to receive the increased quarterly distributions on the Class B units for the period of April 7, 2007, through December 31, 2007, and continuing thereafter until ONEOK gives us no less than 90 days advance notice that it has withdrawn its waiver. ONEOK could withdraw such waiver and begin receiving such increased distributions, effective with respect to any distribution on the Class B units declared or paid on or after 90 days following delivery of the notice.If our unitholders vote to remove ONEOK or its affiliates as our general partner, quarterly distributions and distributions payable to ONEOK upon liquidation of the Class B units would increase.Since the proposed amendments to our Partnership Agreement were not approved by the requisite number of our common unitholders, if our common unitholders vote at any time to remove ONEOK or its affiliates as our general partner, quarterly distributions payable on the Class B limited partner units would increase to 123.5 percent of the distributions payable with respect to the common units, and distributions payable upon liquidation of the Class B limited partner units would increase to 123.5 percent of the distributions payable with respect to the common units.Our unitholders have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner’s directors, which could lower the trading price of our common units. In addition, even if unitholders are dissatisfied, they cannot easily remove our general partner.Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management’s decisions regarding our business. Unitholders have no right to elect our general partner or its directors on an annual or other continuing basis. The Board of Directors of our general partner, including the independent directors, is chosen by the owners of the general partner and not by the unitholders.Furthermore, if unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, it may be difficult to remove ONEOK Partners GP or its officers or directors. ONEOK Partners GP may not be removed except upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two thirds of our outstanding units voting together as a single class (excluding units held by ONEOK Partners GP and its affiliates). As a result of this provision, the trading price of our common units may be lower than other forms of equity ownership because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.We do not operate all of our assets nor do we employ directly any of the persons responsible for providing us with administrative, operating and management services. This reliance on others to operate our assets and to provide other services could adversely affect our business and operating results.We rely on ONEOK and ONEOK Partners GP to provide us with administrative, operating and management services. We have a limited ability to control our operations and the associated costs of such operations. The success of these operations depends on a number of factors that are outside our control, including the competence and financial resources of the provider. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners GP may outsource some or all of these services to third parties, and a failure to perform by these third-29Table of Contentsparty providers could lead to delays in or interruptions of these services. Should ONEOK and ONEOK Partners GP not perform their respective contractual obligations, we may have to contract elsewhere for these services, which may cost more than we are currently paying. In addition, we may not be able to obtain the same level or kind of service or retain or receive the services in a timely manner, which may impact our ability to perform under our contracts and negatively affect our business and operating results. Our reliance on ONEOK and ONEOK Partners GP and third-party providers with which they contract, together with our limited ability to control certain costs, could harm our business and results of operations.Our Partnership Agreement limits our general partner’s fiduciary duties to our unitholders and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.Our Partnership Agreement contains provisions that reduce the standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law. For example, our Partnership Agreement:•permits our general partner to make a number of decisions considering only the interests and factors beneficial to itself or its parent, ONEOK, that it desires, and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or any limited partner. Examples include the exercise of its limited call right, its voting rights with respect to the units it owns, its registration rights and its determination (through its Board of Directors) whether to consent to any merger or consolidation of us;•provides that our general partner will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as general partner so long as it acted in “good faith,” meaning it believed the decision was in, or not inconsistent with, our best interests;•provides that our general partner is entitled to make other decisions in “good faith” if it reasonably believes that the decision is in, or not inconsistent with, our best interests;•provides generally that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not approved by the Conflicts Committee and not involving a vote of unitholders must be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or be “fair and reasonable” to us, as determined by our general partner in “good faith,” and that, in determining whether a transaction or resolution is “fair and reasonable,” our general partner may consider the totality of the relationships between the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly advantageous or beneficial to us; and•provides that our general partner and its affiliates, officers and directors will be indemnified by the Partnership for any acts or omissions so long as such person acted in “good faith” and in a manner believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interest of us and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe its conduct was unlawful.By purchasing a common unit, a common unitholder will be bound by the provisions in our Partnership Agreement, including the provisions discussed above.The Board of Directors of our general partner, our general partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary duties, which may permit them to favor their own interests.ONEOK owns 100 percent of our general partner interest, and as a result of our August 2013 public offering of common units and units sold in 2013 under our “at-the-market” equity program, ONEOK and its subsidiaries own a 41.2 percent aggregate equity interest in us at December 31, 2013. Our Partnership Agreement limits any fiduciary duties owed by our general partner and ONEOK to those duties that are stated specifically in our Partnership Agreement. Although ONEOK, through the Board of Directors of our general partner, has an obligation to manage us in a manner that is in, or not inconsistent with, our best interests, the Board of Directors of ONEOK has a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to ONEOK. Five of the eight members of the Board of Directors of our general partner are either members of ONEOK’s Board of Directors or executive management of ONEOK. Three independent members and one management member of the Board of Directors of our general partner also are members of ONEOK’s Board of Directors, with the management member being the only management member of ONEOK’s Board of Directors. Conflicts of interest may arise between ONEOK and its other affiliates and between us and our unitholders. In resolving these conflicts, our general partner may determine that the transaction is “fair and reasonable” to us, without the agreement of any other party, including the Audit Committee. In that regard, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its other affiliates over the interests of our unitholders, as long as it does not take action that conflicts with our Partnership Agreement. These conflicts include, among others, the following situations:•our general partner, which is owned by ONEOK, and the Board of Directors of our general partner are allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us in resolving conflicts of interest, which has the effect of limiting their fiduciary duties to our unitholders;30Table of Contents•our Partnership Agreement limits the liability and reduces the fiduciary duties of the members of the Board of Directors of our general partner and also restricts the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without the limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty;•the Board of Directors of our general partner determines the amount and timing of our cash reserves, asset purchases and sales, capital expenditures, borrowings and issuances of additional partnership securities, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;•the Board of Directors of our general partner approves the amount and timing of any capital expenditures and determines whether they are maintenance capital expenditures or growth capital expenditures, which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;•the Board of Directors of our general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions, even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make incentive distributions;•our Partnership Agreement provides that costs incurred by the Board of Directors, our general partner and its affiliates in the conduct of our business are reimbursable by us;•our Partnership Agreement does not restrict the members of the Board of Directors of our general partner from causing us to pay the Board of Directors, our general partner or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf;•our general partner may exercise its limited right to call and purchase common units, which right may be assigned or transferred to, among others, us or affiliates of the general partner, if the general partner and its affiliates own 80 percent or more of the common units; and•the Board of Directors and Audit and Conflicts Committees of our general partner decide whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us.Our general partner and its affiliates may compete directly with us and have no obligation to present business opportunities to us.ONEOK and its affiliates are not prohibited from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. ONEOK may acquire, construct or dispose of additional midstream or other assets in the future without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or construct any of those assets. In addition, under our Partnership Agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, will not apply to ONEOK and its affiliates. As a result, neither ONEOK nor any of its affiliates has any obligation to present business opportunities to us.The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.Our general partner may transfer all, or any part of, its general partner interest to a third party without the consent of the unitholders. The members, shareholders or unitholders, as the case may be, of our new general partner may then be in a position to replace all or a portion of the directors of our general partner with their own choices and to possibly control the decisions made by the Board of Directors of our general partner.Any reduction in our credit ratings could affect materially and adversely our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.Our senior unsecured long-term debt and commercial paper program have been assigned an investment-grade rating of “Baa2” (Stable) and Prime-2, respectively, by Moody’s and “BBB” (Stable) and A2, respectively, by S&P. We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. Specifically, if Moody’s or S&P were to downgrade our long-term debt or commercial paper program rating, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase, which would affect adversely our financial results, and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. Ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.Increases in interest rates may cause the market price of our common units to decline.An increase in interest rates may cause a corresponding decline in demand for equity investments in general and in particular for yield-based equity investments such as our common units. Any such increase in interest rates or reduction in demand for our common units resulting from other more attractive investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our common units to decline.31Table of ContentsWe do not have the same flexibility as other types of organizations to accumulate cash and equity to protect against illiquidity in the future.Unlike a corporation, our Partnership Agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash reduced by any amounts of reserves for commitments and contingencies, including capital and operating costs and debt- service requirements, all of which are significant. The value of our units and other limited partner interests may decrease in correlation with decreases in the amount we distribute per unit. Accordingly, if we experience a liquidity problem in the future, we may not be able to issue more equity or incur more debt to recapitalize.An event of default may require us to offer to repurchase certain of our senior notes or may impair our ability to access capital.The indentures governing our senior notes include an event of default upon the acceleration of other indebtedness of $100 million or more. Such an event of default would entitle the trustee or the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding senior notes to declare those senior notes immediately due and payable in full. We may not have sufficient cash on hand to repurchase and repay any accelerated senior notes, which may cause us to borrow money under our credit facilities or seek alternative financing sources to finance the repayments and repurchases. We could also face difficulties accessing capital or our borrowing costs could increase, impacting our ability to obtain financing for acquisitions or capital expenditures, to refinance indebtedness and to fulfill our debt obligations.Our indebtedness could impair our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations.As of December 31, 2013, we had total indebtedness of approximately $6.1 billion. Our indebtedness could have significant consequences. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our senior notes and our other indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such other indebtedness or our senior notes;•impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general business purposes;•diminish our ability to withstand a downturn in our business or the economy;•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt-service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, distributions to partners and general partnership purposes;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have proportionately less debt.We are not prohibited under the indentures governing our senior notes from incurring additional indebtedness, but our debt agreements do subject us to certain operational limitations summarized in the next paragraph. Our incurrence of significant additional indebtedness would exacerbate the negative consequences mentioned above and could affect adversely our ability to repay our senior notes and other indebtedness.Our debt agreements contain provisions that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue our business activities. For example, certain of these agreements contain provisions that, among other things, limit our ability to make loans or investments, make material changes to the nature of our business, merge, consolidate or engage in asset sales, grant liens or make negative pledges. Certain agreements also require us to maintain certain financial ratios, which limit the amount of additional indebtedness we can incur. For example, our Partnership Credit Agreement contains a legal covenant requiring us to maintain a ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA, as defined in our Partnership Credit Agreement, adjusted for all noncash charges and increased for projected EBITDA from certain lender-approved capital expansion projects) of no more than 5.0 to 1.These restrictions could result in higher costs of borrowing and impair our ability to generate additional cash. Future financing agreements we may enter into may contain similar or more restrictive covenants.If we are unable to meet our debt-service obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. We may be unable to obtain financing, raise equity or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.Borrowings under our Partnership Credit Agreement and our senior notes are nonrecourse to ONEOK, and ONEOK does not guarantee our debt, commercial paper or other similar commitments.32Table of ContentsWe and the Intermediate Partnership have a holding company structure in which our subsidiaries conduct our operations and own our operating assets.We and the Intermediate Partnership are holding companies, and our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own all of our operating assets. Neither we nor the Intermediate Partnership have significant assets other than the partnership interests and the equity in our subsidiaries and other investments. As a result, our ability to make quarterly distributions and required payments on our indebtedness depends on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us. The ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may be restricted by, among other things, credit facilities, applicable state partnership laws, and other laws and regulations, including FERC policies. If we are unable to obtain the funds necessary to make quarterly distributions or required payments on our indebtedness, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as refinancing the indebtedness or seeking alternative financing sources to fund the quarterly distributions and indebtedness payments.We may issue additional common units or other units without unitholder approval, which would dilute unitholders’ ownership interests.Our general partner, without the approval of our unitholders, may cause us to issue an unlimited number of additional units. The issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:•our unitholders’ proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;•the distributions to our general partner related to its incentive distribution rights may increase and the distribution paid on each unit may decrease;•the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and•the market price of the common units may decline.Notwithstanding the foregoing, the issuance of equity securities ranking senior to the common units requires approval of a majority of the outstanding common units.In addition, whenever we issue equity securities to any person other than our general partner and its affiliates, our general partner has the right, under the Partnership Agreement, which it may from time to time assign in whole or in part to any of its affiliates, to purchase additional partnership interests on the same terms as they are issued to other purchasers. This allows our general partner and its affiliates to maintain their proportionate partnership interest in us. No other unitholder has a similar right. Therefore, only the general partner may protect itself against dilution caused by issuance of additional equity interests.Our general partner has a limited call right that may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price.If at any time our general partner and its affiliates own 80 percent or more of the common units, our general partner will have the right, but not the obligation, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then-current market price. As a result, unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on their investment. Unitholders also may incur a tax liability upon the sale of their units. Our general partner is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon exercise of the limited call right. There is no restriction in our Partnership Agreement that prevents our general partner from issuing additional common units and exercising its call right. If our general partner exercised its limited call right, the effect would be to take us private and, if the units subsequently were deregistered, we would no longer be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.Our Partnership Agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20 percent or more of our common units.Our Partnership Agreement restricts unitholders’ voting rights by providing that any units held by a person or entity that owns 20 percent or more of our common units then outstanding, other than our general partner and its affiliates, cannot vote on any matter. Our Partnership Agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders’ ability to influence the manner or direction of management.33Table of ContentsUnitholders may not have limited liability if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business.A general partner of a limited partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership, such as debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are made expressly without recourse to the general partner. We are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, and we and our subsidiaries conduct business in a number of other states. The limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some of the other states in which we do business. A unitholder could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court or government agency should determine that (i) we were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that state’s limited partnership statute; or (ii) a unitholder’s right to act with other unitholders to remove or replace our general partner, to approve some amendments to our Partnership Agreement or to take other actions under our Partnership Agreement constitute “control” of our business.Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions.Under certain circumstances, our unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (“Delaware Act”), we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities that are non-recourse to the Partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of an impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to us for the repayment of the distribution amount. Likewise, upon the winding up of the Partnership, in the event that (a) we do not distribute assets in the following order: (i) to creditors in satisfaction of their liabilities; (ii) to partners and former partners in satisfaction of liabilities for distributions owed under our Partnership Agreement; (iii) to partners for the return of their contributions; and finally (iv) to the partners in the proportions in which the partners share in distributions and (b) a limited partner knows at the time that the distribution violated the Delaware Act, then such limited partner will be liable for a period of three years from the impermissible distribution to repay the distribution under Section 17-804 of the Delaware Act.A purchaser of common units becomes a limited partner and is liable for the obligations of the transferring limited partner to make contributions to us that are known to such purchaser of common units at the time it became a limited partner and for unknown obligations, if the liabilities could be determined from our Partnership Agreement.A court may use fraudulent conveyance considerations to avoid or subordinate the Intermediate Partnership’s guarantee of certain of our senior notes.Various applicable fraudulent conveyance laws have been enacted for the protection of creditors. In a Florida bankruptcy case, a court ruled that certain guarantees were unenforceable due to fraudulent conveyance laws, among other factors. Similarly, a court may use fraudulent conveyance laws to subordinate or avoid the guarantee of certain of our senior notes issued by the Intermediate Partnership. It is also possible that under certain circumstances a court could hold that the direct obligations of the Intermediate Partnership could be superior to the obligations under that guarantee.A court could avoid or subordinate the Intermediate Partnership’s guarantee of certain of our senior notes in favor of the Intermediate Partnership’s other debts or liabilities to the extent that the court determined either of the following were true at the time the Intermediate Partnership issued the guarantee:•the Intermediate Partnership incurred the guarantee with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud any of its present or future creditors or the Intermediate Partnership contemplated insolvency with a design to favor one or more creditors to the total or partial exclusion of others; or•the Intermediate Partnership did not receive fair consideration or reasonable equivalent value for issuing the guarantee, and, at the time it issued the guarantee, the Intermediate Partnership:–was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the guarantee;–was engaged or about to engage in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or–intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they matured.The measure of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing will vary depending upon the law of the relevant jurisdiction. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent for purposes of the foregoing if:34Table of Contents•the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, were greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets at a fair valuation;•the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or•it could not pay its debts as they become due.Among other things, a legal challenge of the Intermediate Partnership’s guarantee of certain of our senior notes on fraudulent conveyance grounds may focus on the benefits, if any, realized by the Intermediate Partnership as a result of our issuance of such senior notes. To the extent the Intermediate Partnership’s guarantee of certain of our senior notes is avoided as a result of fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of such senior notes would cease to have any claim in respect of the guarantee.Our operating cash flow is derived partially from cash distributions we receive from our unconsolidated affiliates.Our operating cash flow is derived partially from cash distributions we receive from our unconsolidated affiliates which represent a return on investment, as discussed in Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The amount of cash that our unconsolidated affiliates can distribute principally depends upon the amount of cash flow these affiliates generate from their respective operations, which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We do not have any direct control over the cash distribution policies of our unconsolidated affiliates. This lack of control may contribute to our not having sufficient available cash each quarter to continue paying distributions at our current levels.Additionally, the amount of cash that we have available for cash distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow, including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings, and is not solely a function of profitability, which will be affected by noncash items such as depreciation, amortization and provisions for asset impairments. As a result, we may be able to make cash distributions during periods when we record losses and may not be able to make cash distributions during periods when we record net income.The credit and risk profile of ONEOK Partners GP and its owner could affect adversely our credit ratings and profile.The credit and business risk profiles of ONEOK Partners GP, and of ONEOK as the owner of ONEOK Partners GP, may be factors in credit evaluations of us as a publicly traded limited partnership due to the significant influence of ONEOK Partners GP and ONEOK over our business activities, including our cash distributions, acquisition strategy and business risk profile. Another factor that may be considered is the financial condition of ONEOK Partners GP and its owner, including the degree of their financial leverage and their dependence on cash flow from the Partnership to service their indebtedness. ONEOK is dependent on the cash distributions from its general and limited partner equity interests in us to service indebtedness. Any distributions by us to ONEOK will be made only after satisfying our then current obligations to our creditors. Although we have taken certain steps in our organizational structure, financial reporting and contractual relationships to reflect the separateness of us from the entity that controls ONEOK Partners GP (i.e., ONEOK), our credit ratings and business-risk profile could be affected adversely if the ratings and risk profiles of such entities were viewed as substantially lower or riskier than ours.The right to receive payments on our outstanding debt securities and subsidiary guarantees is unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness as well as to any existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes.Our debt securities are effectively subordinated to claims of our secured creditors, and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to the claims of our secured creditors as well as the secured creditors of our subsidiary guarantors. Although many of our operating subsidiaries have guaranteed such debt securities, the guarantees are subject to release under certain circumstances, and we may have subsidiaries that are not guarantors. In that case, the debt securities effectively would be subordinated to the claims of all creditors, including trade creditors and tort claimants, of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors. In the event of the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or winding up of the business of a subsidiary that is not a guarantor, creditors of that subsidiary would generally have the right to be paid in full before any distribution is made to us or the holders of the debt securities.The ability to transfer our debt securities may be limited by the absence of a trading market.We do not currently intend to apply for listing of our debt securities on any securities exchange or stock market. The liquidity of any market for our debt securities will depend on the number of holders of those debt securities, the interest of securities 35Table of Contentsdealers in making a market in those debt securities and other factors. Accordingly, we can give no assurance as to the development or liquidity of any market for the debt securities.TAX RISKSOur tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states. If the IRS were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or if we were to become subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, then our cash available for distribution to our common unitholders would be reduced substantially.The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. We have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS on this matter.Despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under Delaware law, it is possible, in certain circumstances, for a partnership such as ours to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. A change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity. If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35 percent, and would likely pay additional state income taxes at varying rates. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, the cash available for distributions to our common unitholders would be reduced substantially. Therefore, if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, there would be a material reduction in the anticipated free cash flow and after-tax return to our common unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units.In addition, changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity-level taxation by individual states. Because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. For example, we are subject to an entity-level Texas franchise tax. Imposition of any similar taxes by any other state may reduce substantially the cash available for distribution to our common unitholders and, therefore, impact negatively the value of an investment in our common units.Our Partnership Agreement provides that, if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to additional entity-level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us.The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common or other units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.The present federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time. For example, from time to time, members of the United States Congress may propose and consider substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that could affect the tax treatment of certain publicly traded partnerships. Any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively. We are unable to predict whether any previously considered changes or any other proposals will be enacted ultimately. Any such changes could impact negatively the value of an investment in our common units and the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders.An IRS contest of the federal income tax positions we take may affect adversely the market for our common units, and the costs of any IRS contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.We have not requested a ruling from the IRS with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the federal income tax positions we take, and such positions may not ultimately be sustained. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take. A court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take. Any contest with the IRS may affect adversely the taxable income reported to our unitholders and the income taxes they are required to pay. As a result, any such contest with the IRS may affect materially and adversely the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. In addition, the costs of any such contest with the IRS will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner because such costs will reduce our cash available for distribution.36Table of ContentsA unitholder’s share of our income may be taxable to the unitholder for federal income tax purposes even if the unitholder does not receive any cash distributions from us.Because our unitholders may be treated as partners to whom we will allocate taxable income that could be different in amount than the cash we distribute, a unitholder’s share of our taxable income will be taxable to the unitholder, which may require the payment of federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on the unitholder’s share of our taxable income, even if the unitholder receives no cash distributions from us. A unitholder may not receive cash distributions from us equal to the unitholder’s share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income.In the event we issue additional units or engage in certain other transactions in the future, the allocable share of nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the unitholders will be recalculated to take into account our issuance of any additional units. Any reduction in a unitholder’s share of our nonrecourse liabilities will be treated as a distribution of cash to that unitholder and will result in a corresponding tax basis reduction in a unitholder’s units. A deemed cash distribution may, under certain circumstances, result in the recognition of taxable gain by a unitholder, to the extent that the deemed cash distribution exceeds such unitholder’s tax basis in its units.In addition, the federal income tax liability of a unitholder could be increased if we dispose of assets or make a future offering of units and use the proceeds in a manner that does not produce substantial additional deductions, such as to repay indebtedness currently outstanding or to acquire property that is not eligible for depreciation or amortization for federal income tax purposes or that is depreciable or amortizable at a rate significantly slower than the rate currently applicable to the our assets.The taxable gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be different than expected.A unitholder will recognize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale of common units equal to the difference between the amount realized and the unitholder’s tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of the unitholder’s allocable share of our net taxable income decrease the unitholder’s tax basis in the common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the common units the unitholder sells will, in effect, become taxable income to a unitholder if the common units are sold at a price greater than the tax basis in those units, even if the price the unitholder receives is less than the original cost. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized on a sale of common units, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. In addition, because the amount realized may include a unitholder’s share of our nonrecourse liabilities, a unitholder who sells common units may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash received from the sale.Tax-exempt entities and non-United States persons face unique tax issues from owning common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.Investment in common units by tax-exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts and non-United States persons, raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including individual retirement accounts and other retirement plans, may be taxable to them as “unrelated business taxable income.” Distributions to non-United States persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate, and non-United States persons will be required to file United States federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income.We treat each purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could affect adversely the value of the common units.Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, we have adopted depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could affect adversely the amount of tax benefits available to unitholders. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from a unitholder’s sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to a unitholder’s tax returns.We may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction for federal income tax purpose between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our units as of the close of business on the last day of the preceding month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing Treasury regulations, and although the United States Department of the Treasury issued proposed Treasury regulations allowing a similar monthly simplifying convention, such regulations are not final and do not authorize specifically 37Table of Contentsthe use of the proration method we have adopted. If the IRS were to challenge our proration method or new Treasury regulations were issued, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.Unitholders may be subject to state and local taxes and return-filing requirements as a result of investing in our common units.In addition to federal income taxes, unitholders may be subject to other taxes, including state and local income taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or own property, even if the unitholder does not live in any of those jurisdictions. Unitholders may be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions and may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may own assets or conduct business in additional states or foreign countries that impose a personal income tax or an entity level tax.We determine our depreciation and cost-recovery allowances using federal income tax methods and may use methods that result in the largest deductions being taken in the early years after assets are placed in service. Some of the states in which we do business or own property may not conform to these federal depreciation methods. A successful challenge to these methods could affect adversely the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders for state tax purposes. It also could affect the amount of gain from a unitholder’s sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to the unitholder’s state tax returns. It is each unitholder’s responsibility to file all United States federal, state and local tax returns and foreign tax returns, as applicable. Our legal counsel has not rendered an opinion on the state and local tax consequences of an investment in our common units.Some of the states in which we do business or own property may require us to, or we may elect to, withhold a percentage of income from amounts to be distributed to a unitholder who is not a resident of the state. Withholding the amount of which may be greater or less than a particular unitholder’s income tax liability to the state generally does not relieve the nonresident unitholder from the obligation to file an income tax return. Amounts withheld may be treated as if distributed to unitholders for purposes of determining the amounts distributed by us.The sale or exchange of 50 percent or more of our capital and profits interests during any 12-month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes.We will be considered to have technically terminated our partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50 percent or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period. For purposes of determining whether the 50 percent threshold has been met, multiple sales of the same interest will be counted only once. Our technical termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders, which would result in us filing two tax returns (and our unitholders could receive two Schedules K-1 if relief was not available, as described below) for one fiscal year and could also result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income. In the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending December 31, the closing of our taxable year may result in more than 12 months of our taxable income or loss being included in the unitholder’s taxable income for the year of termination. Our technical termination would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, but instead, after our termination, we would be treated as a new partnership for federal income tax purposes. If treated as a new partnership, we would be required to make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine that a technical termination occurred.The IRS announced a publicly traded partnership technical termination relief procedure, whereby, if a publicly traded partnership that has a technical termination requests and the IRS grants special relief, among other things, the partnership will only have to provide one Schedule K-1 to unitholders for the year, notwithstanding two partnership tax years resulting from the technical termination.We have adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between the general partner and the unitholders. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could affect adversely the value of our common units.When we issue additional units or engage in certain other transactions, we determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our unitholders and our general partner. Our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets. In that case, there may be a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between certain unitholders and the general partner, which may be unfavorable to such unitholders. Moreover, 38Table of Contentsunder our current valuation methods, subsequent purchasers of common units may have a greater portion of their Internal Revenue Code Section 743(b) adjustment allocated to our tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our intangible assets. The IRS may challenge our valuation methods, or our allocation of the Section 743(b) adjustment attributable to our tangible and intangible assets, and allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction between the general partner and certain of our unitholders.A successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could affect adversely the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders. It also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders’ sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders’ tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions.A unitholder whose units are loaned to a “short seller” to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of those units. If so, the unitholder would no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.Because there is no tax concept of loaning a partnership interest, a unitholder whose units are loaned to a “short seller” to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units. In that case, the unitholder may no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller, and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan to the short seller, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder, and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to consult a tax advisor to discuss whether it is advisable to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units.ITEM 1B.
