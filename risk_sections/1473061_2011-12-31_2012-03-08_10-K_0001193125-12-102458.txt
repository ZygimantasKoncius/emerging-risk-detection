ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Energy prices are very volatile, and if commodity prices remain low or decline, our revenues, profitability and cash flows will be adversely affected. A sustained or further decline in oil and gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to fund our capital expenditures and meet our financial commitments. The prices we receive for our oil and gas production heavily influence our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil and gas are commodities; therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and will likely continue to be volatile in the future. For example, during 2011, the NYMEX natural gas futures price ranged from a high of $4.85 per Mmbtu to a low of $2.99 per Mmbtu. At March 1, 2012, the NYMEX natural gas futures price was $2.46 per Mmbtu. Approximately 97.5% of our production is natural gas. The prices that we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on a variety of factors that are beyond our control, such as:  domestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil and gas;  price and level of foreign imports of oil and gas;  level of consumer product demand;  weather conditions;  overall domestic and global economic conditions;  political and economic conditions in oil and gas producing countries, including embargoes and continued hostilities in the Middle East and other sustained military campaigns, acts of terrorism or sabotage;  actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;  the impact of the U.S. dollar exchange rates on oil and gas prices;  technological advances affecting energy consumption;  governmental regulations and taxation;  the impact of energy conservation efforts;  the costs, proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities; and  the price and availability of alternative fuels. Our revenue, profitability and cash flow depend upon the prices and demand for oil and gas, and a drop in prices will significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth. In particular, declines in commodity prices will:  reduce the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures, including the drilling of wells and the construction of infrastructure to transport the gas produced;  negatively impact the value of our reserves because declines in oil and gas prices would reduce the amount of oil and gas we can produce economically;  reduce the drilling and production activity of our third-party customers and increase the rate at which our customers shut in wells;  potentially reduce gas available for transport on the KPC Pipeline; and 17 Table of Contents  limit our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. We may be required to write-down the carrying value of our assets. Lower oil and gas prices may not only decrease our revenues, profitability and cash flows, but also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. This may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated reserves. Substantial decreases in oil and gas prices have rendered and may continue to render a significant number of our planned exploration and development projects uneconomic. If this occurs, or if our estimates of development costs increase, production data factors change or drilling results deteriorate, accounting rules may require us to write-down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil or gas properties, pipelines or other long-lived assets for impairments. We will be required to perform impairment tests on our assets periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant a review of our assets. To the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of our assets, the carrying value may not be recoverable and may therefore, require a write-down of such carrying value. For example, during 2009 we recognized a ceiling test impairment of $102.9 million related to our oil and gas properties as well as impairment charges of $53.6 million on our interstate pipeline and related contract-based intangible assets and $112.2 million on our gathering system assets. We may incur further impairment charges in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We have reduced debt but we remain highly leveraged. At December 31, 2011, we had $213 million of contractual commitments outstanding, consisting of debt service requirements, non-cancelable operating lease and purchase obligation commitments. Of such amount, $190 million was outstanding under our $350 million secured borrowing base revolving credit facility with a current borrowing base of $200 million. There has been a significant decline in natural gas prices since the borrowing base was last determined. As a result, we currently expect the borrowing base to be reduced in connection with the redetermination at April 30, 2012. Any reduction in the borrowing base will reduce our available liquidity, and, if the reduction results in the outstanding amount under the facility exceeding the borrowing base, which we currently expect, we will be required to repay the deficiency within 30 days or in six monthly installments thereafter, at our election. Our ability to borrow funds will depend upon a number of factors, including the condition of the financial markets. Under certain circumstances, the use of leverage may create a greater risk of loss to stockholders than if we did not borrow. The risk of loss in such circumstances is increased because we would be obligated to meet fixed payment obligations on specified dates regardless of our cash flow. If we do not make our debt service payments when due, our lenders may foreclose on assets securing such debt. Our future level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:  our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, if necessary, for drilling, expansion, working capital and other business needs may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;  a substantial decrease in our revenues as a result of lower oil and gas prices, decreased production or other factors could make it difficult for us to pay our liabilities. Any failure by us to meet these obligations could result in litigation, non-performance by contract counterparties or bankruptcy;  our funds available for operations and future business opportunities will be reduced by that portion of our cash flow required to make principal or interest payments on our debt;  we may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and  our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions may be limited. 18 Table of Contents Our ability to service our debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments and/or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital. We may not be able to affect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all. Our credit agreements have substantial restrictions and financial covenants that restrict our business and financing activities. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our credit agreements restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs and to engage, expand or pursue our business activities. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by our results of operations and financial conditions and events or circumstances beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions do not improve, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If we violate any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in our credit agreements, our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable, the interest rates on our credit agreements may increase and the lenders commitment, if any, to make further loans to us may terminate. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments in which event we may be forced to file for bankruptcy. For a description of our credit facilities, please read Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCredit Agreements and Note 10 in Part II, Item 8. An increase in market interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase. Borrowings under our credit agreements bear interest at floating rates. The rates are subject to adjustment based on fluctuations in market interest rates. An increase in the interest rates associated with our floating-rate debt would increase our debt service costs and affect our results of operations and cash flow. In addition, an increase in our interest expense could adversely affect our future ability to obtain financing or materially increase the cost of any additional financing. We are unable to pass through all of our costs and expenses for gathering and compression to royalty owners under our gas leases, which reduces our net income and cash flows. We incur costs and expenses for gathering, dehydration, treating and compression of the gas that we produce. The terms of some of our existing gas leases and other development rights currently do not, and the terms of some of the gas leases and other development rights that we may acquire in the future may not, allow us to charge the full amount of these costs and expenses to the royalty owners under the leases or other agreements. During 2011, we reached settlements of several royalty owner lawsuits in Oklahoma and Kansas. These lawsuits were related, in part, to the amounts previously deducted by us to cover the costs and expenses for gathering and compression. Please see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of the litigation. As a result of these settlements, we have begun charging post-production costs to royalty and overriding royalty interest owners pursuant to an agreed upon formula. To the extent that we are unable to charge and recover the full amount of these costs and expenses from our royalty owners, our net income and cash flows will be reduced. We are exposed to trade credit risk in the ordinary course of our business activities. We are exposed to risks of loss in the event of nonperformance by our customers and by counterparties to our derivative contracts. Some of our customers and counterparties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks. Even if our credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly, we may experience financial losses in our dealings with other parties. Any increase in the nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers and/or counterparties could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 19 Table of Contents Unless we replace the reserves that we produce, our existing reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flows. Producing oil and gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and gas reserves, production and cash flow depend on our success in developing and exploiting our reserves efficiently and finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves economically. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs or production from our existing wells could decline at a faster rate than we have estimated, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Factors that may hinder our ability to acquire additional reserves include competition, access to capital, prevailing gas prices and attractiveness of properties for sale. Our estimated reserves are based on assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. It is not possible to measure underground accumulations of oil and gas in an exact way. Reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be directly measured and assumptions concerning future oil and gas prices, production levels and operating and development costs. In estimating our level of oil and gas reserves, we and our independent reserve engineers make certain assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, including assumptions relating to:  a constant level of future oil and gas prices;  geological conditions;  production levels;  capital expenditures;  operating and development costs;  the effects of governmental regulations and taxation; and  availability of funds. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and our estimates of the future net cash flows from our reserves could change significantly. Additionally, there recently has been increased debate and disagreement over the classification of reserves, with particular focus on proved undeveloped reserves. Changing interpretations of the classification standards or disagreements with our interpretations could cause us to write-down reserves. Our standardized measure is calculated using unhedged oil and gas prices and is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. The present value of future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the market value of our estimated proved reserves. The estimated discounted future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves is based on twelve month average prices and expected costs in effect on the day of estimate. However, actual future net cash flows from our oil and gas properties also will be affected by factors such as:  the actual prices we receive for oil and gas;  our actual operating costs in producing oil and gas;  the amount and timing of actual production;  the amount and timing of our capital expenditures; and  changes in governmental regulations or taxation. 20 Table of Contents The timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows in compliance with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive ActivitiesOil and Gas, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general. Drilling for and producing oil and gas is a costly and high-risk activity with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Our drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors, as well as the market price of oil and gas, can adversely affect the economics of a well. Furthermore, our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of other factors, including:  high costs, shortages or delivery delays of drilling rigs, equipment, labor or other services;  adverse weather conditions;  difficulty disposing of water produced as part of the coal bed methane production process;  equipment failures or accidents;  title problems;  pipe or cement failures or casing collapses;  compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements;  environmental hazards, such as gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases;  lost or damaged oilfield drilling and service tools;  loss of drilling fluid circulation;  unexpected operational events and drilling conditions;  increased risk of wellbore instability due to horizontal drilling;  unusual or unexpected geological formations;  natural disasters, such as fires and floods;  blowouts, surface craterings and explosions; and  uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids. A productive well may become uneconomic in the event water or other harmful substances are encountered, which impair or prevent the production of oil or gas from the well. In addition, production from any well may be unmarketable if it is contaminated with water or other harmful substances. We may drill wells that are unproductive or, although productive, do not produce oil or gas in economic quantities. Unsuccessful drilling activities could result in higher costs without any corresponding revenues. Furthermore, a successful completion of a well does not ensure a profitable return on the investment. The revenues of our interstate pipeline business are generated under contracts that must be renegotiated periodically. Prior to 2009, substantially all of the revenues from the KPC Pipeline were generated under firm capacity transportation contracts with Kansas Gas Service and Missouri Gas Energy. These contracts generated 96% and 91% of total revenues from the KPC Pipeline in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The MGE firm contract expired on 21 Table of Contents October 31, 2009, and was not renegotiated or renewed. The loss of this contract resulted in a non-cash impairment charge related to the KPC Pipeline recorded in 2009. The remaining KGS contracts generated 76% of total KPC Pipeline revenue in 2010 and 67% in 2011, and provide for volume step downs in future years. If we are unable to extend or replace our firm capacity transportation contracts when they expire or renegotiate them on terms as favorable as the existing contracts, we could suffer a material reduction in revenues, earnings and cash flows. In particular, our ability to extend and replace contracts could be adversely affected by factors we cannot control, including:  competition by other pipelines, including the change in rates or upstream supply of existing pipeline competitors, as well as the proposed construction by other companies of additional pipeline capacity in markets served by our interstate pipeline;  changes in state regulation of local distribution companies, which may cause them to negotiate short-term contracts or turn back their capacity when their contracts expire;  reduced demand and market conditions in the areas we serve;  the availability of alternative energy sources or natural gas supply points; and  regulatory actions. CEPs limited liability company agreement may prohibit us from engaging in a business combination or other transaction with CEP until December 2014. CEPs limited liability company agreement adopts Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section 203 as it applies to CEP prevents an interested unitholder, defined as a person who owns 15% or more of CEPs outstanding common units, from engaging in business combinations with CEP for three years following the time such person becomes an interested unitholder, unless, among other things, the business combination is approved by CEPs board of managers and holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting common units not owned by the interested unitholder. Section 203 broadly defines business combination to encompass a wide variety of transactions with or caused by an interested unitholder, including mergers, asset sales and other transactions in which the interested unitholder receives a benefit on other than a pro rata basis with other unitholders. This provision of CEPs limited liability company agreement could prohibit us from engaging in a business combination or other transaction with CEP, including transactions that would be beneficial to both our stockholders and CEPs unitholders, until December 2014. Our hedging activities could result in financial losses or reduce our income. We have and may in the future enter into additional derivative arrangements for a significant portion of our production that could result in both realized and unrealized losses on our derivative financial instruments. The extent of our commodity price exposure is related largely to the scope of our hedging activities. The prices at which we enter into derivative financial instruments covering our production in the future will be dependent upon commodity prices at the time we enter into these transactions, which may be substantially lower than current prices or the prices under our existing derivative financial instruments. Accordingly, our commodity price risk management strategy will not protect us from significant and sustained declines in oil and gas prices received for our future production. Conversely, our commodity price risk management strategy may limit our ability to realize cash flow from commodity price increases. Furthermore, we have a policy that requires, and our credit facilities mandate, that those derivative transactions relate to only a portion of our expected production volumes. As a result, we have direct commodity price exposure on the portion of our production volumes that is not covered by a derivative financial instrument. Our actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we enter into hedging transactions for such period. If the actual amount is higher than we estimate, we will have greater 22 Table of Contents commodity price exposure than we intended. If the actual amount is lower than the nominal amount that is subject to our derivative financial instruments, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale or purchase of the underlying physical commodity, resulting in a substantial diminution of our liquidity. As a result of these factors, our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of our cash flows. In addition, our hedging activities are subject to the following risks:  a counterparty may not perform its obligation under the applicable derivative instrument;  there may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying commodity price in the derivative instrument and the actual price received; and  the steps we take to monitor our derivative financial instruments may not detect and prevent violations of our risk management policies and procedures. Because of our lack of asset and geographic diversification, adverse developments in our operating areas would adversely affect our results of operations. Substantially all of our assets are located in the Cherokee Basin. As a result, our business is disproportionately exposed to adverse developments affecting this region. Potential adverse developments could result from, among other things, changes in governmental regulation, capacity constraints with respect to the pipelines connected to our wells, curtailment of production, natural disasters or adverse weather conditions in or affecting these regions. Due to our lack of diversification in asset type and location, an adverse development in our business or this operating area would have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition and results of operations than if we maintained more diverse assets and operating areas. The oil and gas industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete effectively with larger companies, which may adversely affect our results of operations. The oil and gas industry is intensely competitive with respect to acquiring prospects and productive properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing equipment and trained personnel, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources. Many of our competitors are major and large independent oil and natural gas companies, and they not only drill for and produce oil and gas, but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. Our larger competitors also possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than our resources. These companies may be able to pay more for oil and gas properties and evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, there is substantial competition for investment capital in the oil and gas industry. These larger companies may have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low oil and gas prices and to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations. Our inability to compete effectively with larger companies could have a material impact on our business activities, results of operations and financial condition. With respect to the KPC Pipeline, we compete with other interstate and intrastate pipelines in the transportation of gas for transportation customers primarily on the basis of transportation rates, fuel rates, access to competitively priced supplies of gas, markets served by the pipeline, and the quality and reliability of transportation services. Major competitors include Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc., Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmissions Pony Express Pipeline and Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company in the Kansas City market and Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc., Atmos Energy Corporation and Mid-Continent Market Center in the Wichita market. Natural gas also competes with other forms of energy available to our customers, including electricity, coal, hydroelectric power, nuclear power and fuel oil. The impact of competition could be significantly increased as a 23 Table of Contents result of factors that have the effect of significantly decreasing demand for natural gas in the markets served by our pipelines, such as competing or alternative forms of energy, adverse economic conditions, weather, higher fuel costs, and taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly increase the cost or limit the use of natural gas. Our business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. If a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected. There are a variety of risks inherent in our operations that may generate liabilities, including contingent liabilities, and financial losses to us, such as:  damage to wells, pipelines, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires and other natural disasters and acts of terrorism;  inadvertent damage from construction, farm and utility equipment;  leaks of gas or oil spills as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities;  fires and explosions; and  other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations. Any of these or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption of our operations, substantial repair costs, personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial revenue losses. We are not fully insured against all risks, including drilling and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance. We do not have property insurance on any of our underground pipeline systems or wellheads that would cover damage to the pipelines. Pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Additionally, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented. Losses could, therefore, occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. Moreover, insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs and on commercially reasonable terms. Premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies have increased substantially in recent years. Due to these cost increases, we may not be able to obtain the levels or types of insurance we would otherwise have obtained, and the insurance coverage we do obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or cover all potential losses. Losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certain of our undeveloped acreage is subject to leases or other agreements that may expire in the near future. In the Cherokee Basin, at December 31, 2011, we held leases on approximately 464,863 net acres, of which 68,313 net acres are not currently held by production. Unless we establish commercial production on the properties subject to these leases during their term, they will expire. Leases covering approximately 38,684 net acres are scheduled to expire before December 31, 2012. If these leases expire and are not renewed, we will lose the right to develop the related properties. We may incur losses as a result of title deficiencies in the properties in which we invest. If an examination of the title history of a property reveals that an oil or gas lease or other developed rights has been purchased in error from a person who is not the owner of the mineral interest desired, our interest would 24 Table of Contents substantially decline in value. In such an instance, the amount paid for such lease or leases or other developed rights would be lost. It is managements practice, in acquiring leases, or undivided interests in leases or other developed rights, not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest to be acquired. Rather, we will rely upon the judgment of lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease or other developed rights in a specific mineral interest. Prior to drilling a well, however, it is the normal practice in the industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review of the spacing unit within which the proposed well is to be drilled to ensure there are no obvious deficiencies in title to the well. Frequently, as a result of such examinations, certain curative work must be done to correct deficiencies in the marketability of the title, and such curative work entails expense. The work might include obtaining affidavits of heirship or causing an estate to be administered. Our failure to obtain these rights may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our gathering assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our gathering assets, which may indirectly cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts gas gathering facilities from FERC jurisdiction. We believe that the facilities comprising our gathering systems meet the traditional tests used by FERC to distinguish nonjurisdictional gathering facilities from jurisdictional transportation facilities, and that, as a result, our gathering systems are not subject to FERCs jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services has been the subject of regular litigation. The classification and regulation of some of our gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. If FERC were to determine that the facilities perform primarily a transmission function, rather than a gathering function, these facilities may become subject to regulation as interstate natural gas pipeline facilities and we may be subject to fines. We believe the expenses associated with seeking certificate authority for construction, service and abandonment, establishing rates and a tariff for these other facilities, and meeting the detailed regulatory accounting and reporting requirements, if these actions were to become necessary, would substantially increase our operating costs and would adversely affect our profitability. FERC regulation also affects our gathering systems and the markets for our natural gas. FERCs policies and practices across the range of its natural gas regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on open access transportation, ratemaking, capacity release and market center promotion, could indirectly affect our gathering systems. In recent years, FERC has pursued pro-competitive policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines. However, FERC may not continue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to oil and natural gas transportation capacity. Although natural gas gathering facilities are exempt from FERC jurisdiction under the NGA, such facilities are subject to rate regulation when owned by an interstate pipeline and other forms of regulation by the state in which such facilities are located. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, open access requirements and rate regulation. Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels now that a number of interstate pipeline companies have transferred gathering facilities to unregulated affiliates. Our gathering operations are limited to the States of Kansas, Oklahoma and West Virginia. We are licensed as an operator of a natural gas gathering system with the KCC and are required to file periodic information reports with the KCC. We are not required to be licensed as an operator or to file reports in Oklahoma or West Virginia. Our gathering operations may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of gathering facilities. 25 Table of Contents Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. In the future, the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes. Additionally, while gathering facilities and other non-interstate pipelines are generally exempt from FERCs jurisdiction, FERC has adopted internet posting requirements that are applicable to certain gathering facilities and other non-interstate pipelines that deliver more than 50 million MMBtu on an annual basis. Our gathering facilities do not currently meet this size threshold and are, therefore, not currently subject to the posting requirements. Moreover, on October 24, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the posting requirements as applied to non-interstate pipelines and gathering facilities on the grounds that they exceeded FERCs authority under the NGA. We do not know whether FERC will seek rehearing of this decision from the Fifth Circuit or petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, or whether it will otherwise modify its regulations relating to natural gas reporting in the future. Nevertheless, it is possible that we could become subject to the posting requirements in the future if, for example, the size threshold were to be lowered or the throughput on our gathering facilities were to increase. If we were to become subject to the posting requirements, we would likely incur additional compliance expenses. The KPC Pipeline is subject to regulation by FERC, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to establish transportation rates that would allow us to recover the full cost of operating the KPC pipeline, plus a reasonable return, which may affect our business and results of operations. Rates charged by interstate natural gas pipelines may generally not exceed the just and reasonable rates approved by FERC, unless they are filed as negotiated rates and accepted by FERC. In addition, interstate natural gas pipelines are prohibited from granting any undue preference to any person, or maintaining any unreasonable difference in their rates, terms, or conditions of service. Consistent with these requirements, the rates, terms, and conditions of the natural gas transportation services provided by interstate pipelines are governed by tariffs approved by FERC. We own and operate the KPC Pipeline, an interstate natural gas pipeline system that is subject to these regulatory requirements. The KPC Pipeline is a 1,120-mile interstate natural gas pipeline system, which transports natural gas from northern Oklahoma and western Kansas to the metropolitan markets of Wichita and Kansas City. As an interstate natural gas pipeline, the KPC Pipeline is subject to FERCs jurisdiction and the regulatory requirements summarized above. Maintaining compliance with these requirements on a continuing basis requires us to incur various expenses. Additional compliance expenses could be incurred if new or amended laws or regulations are enacted or existing laws or regulations are reinterpreted. Additionally, in recent years, FERC has initiated various audits of pipeline compliance activities and commenced investigations of the rates charged by certain pipelines. We may incur additional regulatory expenses if FERC were to commence such an audit or investigation with respect to the KPC Pipeline. The recourse rates set forth in the KPC Pipelines tariff could also be affected by such an investigation. Likewise, the KPC Pipelines customers, the state commissions that regulate certain of those customers, and other interested parties also have the right to file complaints seeking changes in the KPC Pipeline tariff, including with respect to the transportation rates stated therein. As an interstate natural gas pipeline, the KPC Pipeline is subject to regulation by FERC under the NGA. FERCs regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines extends to such matters as:  rates and charges for natural gas transportation services;  certification and construction of new facilities;  extension or abandonment of services and facilities;  maintenance of accounts and records; 26 Table of Contents  relationships between pipelines and certain affiliates;  terms and conditions of service;  depreciation and amortization policies;  acquisition and disposition of facilities; and  initiation and discontinuation of services. The KPC Pipeline may only charge transportation rates that it has been authorized to charge by FERC. In addition, FERC prohibits natural gas companies from engaging in any undue preference or discrimination with respect to rates or terms and conditions of service. The maximum recourse rates that it may charge for transportation services are established through FERCs ratemaking process, and those recourse rates, as well as the terms and conditions of service, are set forth in the KPC Pipelines FERC-approved tariff. Pipelines may also negotiate rates that are higher than the maximum recourse rates stated in their tariffs, provided such rates are filed with, and approved by, FERC. Under the NGA, existing rates may be challenged by complaint or by FERC on its own initiative, and any proposed rate increases may be challenged by protest and are subject to approval by FERC. Any successful challenge against the KPC Pipelines current rates or any future proposed rates could adversely affect our revenues. Generally and absent settlement, the maximum filed recourse rates for interstate pipelines are based on the cost of service plus an approved return on investment, the equity component of which may be determined through the use of a proxy group of similarly situated companies. Other key determinants in the ratemaking process are debt costs, depreciation expense, operating costs of providing service, including an income tax allowance, and volume throughput and contractual capacity commitment assumptions. The likely future regulations under which we will operate the KPC Pipeline may change; FERC periodically revises and refines its ratemaking and other policies in the context of rulemakings, pipeline-specific adjudications, or other regulatory proceedings. FERCs policies may also be modified when FERC decisions are subjected to judicial review. Changes to ratemaking policies may in turn affect the rates we can charge for transportation service. We could be subject to penalties and fines if we fail to comply with FERC regulations. EP Act 2005 gave FERC increased oversight and penalty authority relating to market manipulation and enforcement. EP Act 2005 amended the NGA, to prohibit market manipulation. It also amended the NGA and the NGPA, to increase civil and criminal penalties for any violations of the NGA, NGPA and any rules, regulations or orders of FERC issued pursuant to those statutes to up to $1,000,000 per day, per violation. In addition, FERC has adopted regulations regarding market manipulation, which make it unlawful for any entity, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or transportation service subject to FERCs jurisdiction, to defraud, make an untrue statement or omit a material fact, or engage in any practice, act or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud. Given the complex and evolving nature of FERC regulation, we may incur significant costs related to compliance with FERC regulations. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. Under the EP Act 2005, FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1,000,000 per day for each violation, and to order disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. FERCs enforcement authority also includes the options of revoking or modifying existing certificate authority and referring matters to the United States Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. Since enactment of the EP Act 2005, FERC has initiated a number of enforcement proceedings and imposed penalties on various regulated entities, including other interstate natural gas pipelines. 27 Table of Contents We could be subject to regulations adopted by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFTC has proposed several regulations, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) enacted into law in July 2010, which related to the trading of derivatives, including natural gas derivatives. Given the complex and evolving nature of CFTC regulation, we may incur significant costs related to compliance with CFTC regulations, and such regulations, to the extent they apply to our activities, may affect our ability to enter into favorable transactions. We do not believe that we will be affected by any such CFTC action materially differently than other industry participants with which we compete. We may incur significant costs and liabilities in the future resulting from a failure to comply with new or existing environmental and operational safety regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances into the environment. We may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to our oil and gas exploration, development, production, gathering and transportation activities. These costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including regulations and enforcement policies, which have tended to become increasingly strict over time. Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These include, for example, (1) the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations that impose obligations related to air emissions; (2) federal and state laws and regulations currently in existence or under development to address GHG emissions; (3) the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and comparable state laws that regulate the management of waste from our facilities; (4) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and comparable state laws that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties owned or operated by us or our predecessors or locations where we or our predecessors sent waste for disposal and (5) the federal Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations that impose detailed permit requirements and strict controls regarding water quality and the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States and state waters. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or newly adopted laws or regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, and the issuance of orders limiting or enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements or operational limitations on such operations. Certain environmental laws, including CERCLA and analogous state laws and regulations, impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances or hydrocarbons have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. There is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in our business due to our handling of oil and natural gas, air emissions related to our operations, and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. For example, an accidental release from one of our pipelines could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. We may not be able to recover these costs from insurance. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. We may face unanticipated water and other waste disposal costs. We may be subject to regulation that restricts our ability to discharge water produced as part of our gas production operations. Productive zones frequently contain water that must be removed in order for the gas to 28 Table of Contents produce, and our ability to remove and dispose of sufficient quantities of water from the various zones will determine whether we can produce gas in commercial quantities. The produced water must be transported from the lease and injected into disposal wells. The availability of disposal wells with sufficient capacity to receive all of the water produced from our wells may affect our ability to produce our wells. Also, the cost to transport and dispose of that water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning water disposal, may reduce our profitability. In the event (1) water produced from our projects fails to meet the quality requirements of applicable regulatory agencies, (2) our wells produce water in excess of the applicable volumetric permit limits, (3) the disposal wells fail to meet the requirements of all applicable regulatory agencies, or (4) we are unable to secure access to disposal wells with sufficient capacity to accept all of the produced water, we may have to shut in wells, reduce drilling activities, or upgrade facilities for water handling or treatment. The costs to dispose of this produced water may increase if any of the following occur:  we cannot obtain future permits from applicable regulatory agencies;  water of lesser quality or requiring additional treatment is produced;  our wells produce excess water;  new laws and regulations require water to be managed or disposed in a different manner; or  costs to transport the produced water to the disposal wells increase. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of the RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. In the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, and waste oils, which may be regulated as hazardous wastes. The transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes that are subject to RCRA or comparable state law requirements. However, drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, production and transportation of oil and gas are currently excluded from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. These wastes may be regulated by EPA or state agencies as non-hazardous solid wastes. Moreover, it is possible that certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Pipeline integrity programs and repairs may impose significant costs and liabilities on us. Pursuant to the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, the DOT has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for intrastate and interstate natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines located near high consequence areas, where a leak or rupture could do the most harm. The regulations require operators to:  perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;  identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area;  improve data collection, integration and analysis;  repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and  implement preventive and mitigating actions. On August 25, 2011, the DOTs Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking in which the agency is seeking public comment on a 29 Table of Contents number of changes to its natural gas transmission pipeline regulations contained in 49 C.F.R. Part 192 including: (1) modifying the definition of high consequence areas; (2) strengthening integrity management requirements as they apply to existing regulated operators and could be applied to currently exempt operators should the exemptions be removed; (3) strengthening or expanding various non-integrity pipeline management standards relating to such matters as valve spacing, automatic or remotely-controlled valves, corrosion protection, and gathering lines; and (4) adding new regulations to govern the safety of underground natural gas storage facilities including underground storage caverns and injection withdrawal wells piping that are not currently regulated under the Part 192 regulations. PHMSA has specifically indicated an intent in this rulemaking to address the need for standards governing the safety of underground natural gas storage facilities. Public comments on these matters were submitted to PHMSA in December 2011, and a final rule from PHMSA is forthcoming. On January 3, 2012, President Obama signed into law the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011. The Act increases the maximum civil penalties for administrative enforcement actions, requires the DOT to study and report on the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety and the use of leak detection systems by hazardous liquid pipelines, requires pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure, and imposes new emergency response and incident notification requirements. KPC completed all baseline assessments of the covered high consequence area integrity testing in 2009. KPC had no expenditures in 2010 or 2011 to implement pipeline integrity management program testing. KPC also incurred costs of approximately $400,000 in 2009, $30,000 in 2010 and $60,000 in 2011 to complete the last year of a Stray Current Survey resulting from a 2005 DOT audit. A closure letter from PHMSA was received for the survey and related remediation. KPC spent a total of $1.9 million. As part of the KPC Integrity Plan, it will begin its reassessment program of high consequence areas in 2012 with 26 miles of pipeline to be reassessed in the Kansas City area. KPC will be testing two high consequence areas in 2012 as a part of the regulatory seven year cycle. It will also continue to hydrotest the pipeline. The capital budget for these tests in 2012 is $225,000 with an operating expense budget of $450,000. These costs may be significantly higher than what KPC has estimated or previously incurred due to the following factors:  our estimate does not include the costs of repairs, remediation or preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, which could be substantial;  additional regulatory requirements that are enacted could significantly increase the amount of these expenditures;  the actual implementation costs may be materially higher than our estimates because of increased industry-wide demand for contractors and service providers and the related increase in costs; or  failure to comply with DOT regulations and any corresponding deadlines, which could subject us to penalties and fines. States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety but may assume responsibility for enforcement of federal interstate pipeline safety regulations and inspection of interstate pipelines. In practice, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. We do not anticipate any significant problems in complying with any state laws and regulations which are determined to be applicable to our operations. Recent and future environmental laws and regulations may significantly limit, and increase the cost of, our exploration, production and transportation operations. Recent and future environmental laws and regulations, including additional federal and state restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) that may be passed in response to climate change concerns, may increase our capital and operating costs and also reduce the demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. The oil and gas industry is a direct source of certain GHG emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane, and future restrictions 30 Table of Contents on such emissions could impact our future operations. The EPA issued the Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule, which requires many suppliers of fossil fuels or industrial chemicals, manufacturers of vehicles and engines, and other facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to begin collecting GHG emissions data under a new reporting system as of January 1, 2010 with the first annual report due March 31, 2011. In November 2010, the EPA issued final regulations requiring the annual reporting of GHG emissions from qualifying facilities in the upstream oil and natural gas sector, including onshore production (Subpart W) with reporting beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. Although the Mandatory Reporting Rule does not control greenhouse gas emission levels from any facilities, it has still caused us to incur monitoring and reporting costs for emissions that are subject to the rule. Further, the rules new requirements for reporting of fugitive and vented methane emissions from the oil and gas industry can be expected to increase our monitoring and reporting costs in the future. After a series of regulatory actions finalized by EPA between December 2009 and May 2010, greenhouse gases became pollutants subject to regulation under the Clean Air Acts Prevention of Significant Deterioration air quality permit program for stationary sources, and the largest of these sources have also become subject to permitting requirements under the Clean Air Acts Title V permitting program. As a result, new major stationary sources of GHG, and modifications of existing major stationary sources that significantly increase their GHG will require a permit setting forth Best Available Control Technology for those emissions. EPA has, through its Tailoring Rule, acted to limit these permitting requirements to only the largest sources of GHG initially, but these new requirements could in the future affect our operations and our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities. The U.S. Congress has also considered legislation to mandate reductions of GHG, and more than 20 states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have already taken legal measures intended to reduce GHG, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Federal or state legislative or regulatory initiatives that regulate or restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business could adversely affect the demand for our products and could increase the costs of our operations, including costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our GHG, pay any taxes related to our GHG and/or administer and manage a GHG program. Reductions in our revenues or increases in our expenses as a result of climate control initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the U.S. Congress is currently considering certain other legislation which, if adopted in its current proposed form, could subject companies involved in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities to substantial additional regulation. If such legislation is adopted, federal tax incentives could be curtailed, and hedging activities as well as certain other business activities of exploration and production companies could be limited, resulting in increased operating costs. Any such limitations or increased capital expenditures and operating costs could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction. We may incur expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining or maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions. For instance, on July 28, 2011, the EPA proposed rules that would establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, EPAs proposed rule package includes New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. The proposed rules would establish specific requirements regarding emissions from compressors, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment in addition to leak detection requirements for natural gas processing plants. The EPA will receive public comment and hold hearings regarding the proposed rules and must take final action on them by April 2012. If finalized, these rules could require a number of modifications to our operations including the installation of new equipment. 31 Table of Contents The Endangered Species Act, or ESA, restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans or limit future development activity in the affected areas. Federal legislation and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays. Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. We routinely employ hydraulic fracturing in our drilling activity. Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions; however, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic-fracturing activities involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and has begun the process of drafting guidance documents related to this newly asserted regulatory authority. In addition, legislation has been introduced before Congress, called the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act, to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic-fracturing process. State legislatures and agencies are also enacting legislation and promulgating rules to regulate hydraulic fracturing and require disclosure of hydraulic fracturing chemicals. For example, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission is currently considering draft amendments to its regulations that would require operators and service companies to disclose certain hydraulic fracturing chemical information through a national online database, FracFocus.org. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting, or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling of wells. There are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic-fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic-fracturing practices, and a committee of the United States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic-fracturing practices. In addition, the EPA has commenced a study of the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health, and has initiated plans to promulgate regulations controlling wastewater disposal associated with hydraulic fracturing and shale gas development. In addition to the EPA, other federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. For example, the U.S. Department of Energy is conducting an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic-fracturing completion methods. Also, the U.S. Department of the Interior is considering disclosure requirements or other mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. Additionally, certain members of Congress have called upon the U.S. Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the natural-gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural-gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration to provide a better understanding of that agencys estimates regarding natural-gas reserves, including reserves from shale formations, as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates. These on-going or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanism. Further, on July 28, 2011, the EPA issued proposed rules that would subject all oil and gas operations (production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution) to regulation under the New Source Performance 32 Table of Contents Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) programs. The EPA proposed rules also include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically-fractured gas wells. These standards include the reduced emission completion (REC) techniques developed in EPAs Natural Gas STAR program along with pit flaring of gas not sent to the gathering line. The standards would be applicable to newly drilled and fractured wells as well as existing wells that are refractured. Further, the proposed regulations under NESHAPS include maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for those glycol dehydrators and storage vessels at major sources of hazardous air pollutants not currently subject to MACT standards. We are currently researching the effect these proposed rules could have on our business. Final action on the proposed rules is expected no later than April 2012. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic-fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic-fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells, increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our ability to grow and to increase our profitability may depend in part on our ability to make acquisitions. Acquisitions are subject to a number of risks. Our ability to grow and increase our profitability may depend in part on our ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in our net income per share and cash flows. We may be unable to make such acquisitions because we are: (1) unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them, (2) unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or (3) outbid by competitors. If we are unable to acquire properties containing proved reserves, our total level of proved reserves will decline as a result of our production, which will adversely affect our results of operations. Even if we do make acquisitions that we believe will increase our net income per share and cash flows, these acquisitions may perform below our expectations and nevertheless result in a decrease in net income and/or cash flows. If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our gas pipelines become unavailable to transport or produce gas, our revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected. We depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. Since we do not own or operate any of these pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. If any of these third-party pipelines and other facilities become unavailable to transport or produce gas, our revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected. We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines are located or on which we may seek to locate pipelines in the future, which could disrupt our operations and growth. We do not own the land on which our pipelines have been constructed, but we do have right-of-way and easement agreements from landowners and governmental agencies, some of which require annual payments to maintain the agreements and most of which have a perpetual term. New pipeline infrastructure construction may subject us to more onerous terms or to increased costs if the design of a pipeline requires redirecting. Such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the construction of additions to the pipelines may require us to obtain new rights-of-way prior to constructing new pipelines. We may be unable to obtain such rights-of-way to expand pipelines or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive to obtain new rights-of-way. If the cost of obtaining new rights-of-way increases, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. 33 Table of Contents Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock The price of our common stock has been and may continue to experience volatility. The price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. In addition to the risk factors described above, some of the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are quarterly increases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community, sales of our common stock by significant stockholders, short-selling of our common stock by investors, issuance of a significant number of shares for equity-based compensation or to raise additional capital to fund our operations, changes in market valuations of similar companies and speculation in the press or investment community about our financial condition or results of operations, as well as any doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. General market conditions and U.S. or international economic factors and political events unrelated to the performance of us may also affect our stock price. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent trends in the price of our common stock to predict the future price of our common stock or our financial results. Our charter and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would result in the purchase of our stockholders common stock at a premium to the market price or would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. There are provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would result in the purchase of our stockholders common stock at a premium to the market price or would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. For example, our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, including limitations on stockholder actions by written consent and on stockholder proposals and director nominations at meetings of stockholders, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. Delaware corporation law may also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by our board of directors. We do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. In addition, our credit agreements prohibit us from paying any dividends without the consent of the lenders under the applicable credit agreement, other than dividends payable solely in our equity interests. White Deer Energy L.P. and its affiliates (White Deer) beneficially own approximately 71% of our common stock after giving effect to the exercise of their outstanding warrants, giving White Deer influence and control in corporate transactions and other matters, including a sale of our Company. At March 1, 2012, including common shares owned and the effect of their outstanding warrants, White Deer beneficially owns 23,746,478 shares, or approximately 71%, of our common stock. In addition, we have agreed to issue White Deer additional warrants on each quarterly dividend payment date of the Series A Preferred Stock prior to July 1, 2013, on which dividends are not paid in cash but instead accrue. The voting power of the Series B Preferred Stock issued with the warrants is limited to 45% of the votes applicable to all outstanding voting stock. In addition, White Deer may vote any shares of common stock held by it without regard to that limit. As a result of its ownership, White Deer effectively is our controlling stockholder and is able to control the election of our directors, determine our corporate and management policies and determine, without the consent of our other stockholders, the outcome of certain corporate transactions or other matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including, for example, potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. The interests of White Deer may not coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock. 34 Table of Contents Subject to certain restrictions, White Deer may make investments in companies that compete with us. In addition, our interests may conflict with those of White Deer with respect to, among other things, business opportunities that may be presented to White Deer and to our directors associated with White Deer. Substantial sales of our common stock by White Deer could cause our stock price to decline. We are unable to predict whether significant amounts of our common stock will be sold by White Deer. Any sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by White Deer, or the perception that these sales might occur, could lower the market price of our common stock.
