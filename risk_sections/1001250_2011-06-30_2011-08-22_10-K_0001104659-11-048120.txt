Item 1A. Risk Factors. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to we, us, our and the Company refer to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries. PART I Item 1. Business. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., founded in 1946 by Estée and Joseph Lauder, is one of the worlds leading manufacturers and marketers of quality skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. Our products are sold in over 150 countries and territories under a number of well-known brand names including: Estée Lauder, Aramis, Clinique, Origins, MAC, Bobbi Brown, La Mer and Aveda. We are also the global licensee for fragrances and/or cosmetics sold under brand names such as Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan, Michael Kors, Sean John and Coach. Each brand is distinctly positioned within the market for cosmetics and other beauty products. We are a pioneer in the cosmetics industry and believe we are a leader in the industry due to the global recognition of our brand names, our leadership in product innovation, our strong market position in key geographic markets and the consistently high quality of our products and High-Touch services. We sell our prestige products principally through limited distribution channels to complement the images associated with our brands. These channels, encompassing over 30,000 points of sale, consist primarily of upscale department stores, specialty retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and spas. In addition, our products are sold in freestanding company-operated stores, our own and authorized retailer websites, stores on cruise ships, direct response television (DRTV), in-flight and duty-free shops and certain fragrances are sold in self-select outlets. We believe that our strategy of pursuing selective distribution strengthens our relationships with retailers, enables our brands to be among the best selling product lines at the stores and heightens the aspirational quality of our brands. For a discussion of recent developments, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Results of Operations  Overview. For segment and geographical area financial information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 20  Segment Data and Related Information. We have been controlled by the Lauder family since the founding of our Company.

In fiscal 2011, hair care products accounted for approximately 5% of our net sales. Given the personal nature of our products and the wide array of consumer preferences and tastes, as well as competition for the attention of consumers, our strategy has been to market and promote our products through distinctive brands seeking to address broad preferences and tastes. Each brand has a single global image that is promoted with consistent logos, packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other brands.

In addition, our products are sold in freestanding company-operated stores, our own and authorized retailer websites, stores on cruise ships, DRTV, in-flight and duty-free shops and certain fragrances are sold in self-select outlets. We maintain a dedicated sales force which sells to our retail accounts in North America and in the major overseas markets, and in the travel retail channel. We have wholly-owned operations in over 40 countries, and a controlling interest in a joint venture that operates in three countries, through which we market, sell and distribute our products. In certain countries, we sell our products through selected local distributors under contractual arrangements designed to protect the image and position of the brands. In addition, we sell certain products in select domestic and international military locations. For information regarding our net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 20  Segment Data and Related Information. We sell Aveda products principally to independent salons and spas, cosmetology schools, third-party distributors and specialty retailers and directly to consumers at our freestanding Aveda Experience Centers and certain Aveda Institutes. There are currently about 8,200 points of sale, primarily in the United States, that sell Aveda products. Bumble and bumble products are principally sold to about 3,200 independent salons and specialty stores, primarily in the United States. Darphin products are principally sold through high-end independent pharmacies, principally in Europe, representing approximately 3,400 points of sale. As part of our strategy to diversify our distribution, we have been selectively opening new single-brand, freestanding stores that we operate. The Origins, Aveda and MAC brands are the primary focus for this method of distribution. At this time, we operate approximately 625 single-brand, freestanding stores worldwide, the majority of which are in the United States, and expect that number to increase moderately over the next several years. We also operate approximately 125 multi-brand stores. We primarily sell BeautyBank products in approximately 1,100 Kohls Department Stores in the United States and internationally in pharmacies and perfumeries, representing approximately 5,000 additional points of sale. We currently sell products from 15 of our brands directly to consumers over the Internet through our own e-commerce and certain of our m-commerce sites. Some or all of these brands are sold over the Internet in the following countries: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Austria, Brazil, Australia, Korea, China, and Japan. As is customary in the cosmetics industry, our practice is to accept returns of our products from retailers if properly requested, authorized and approved. Customers Our strategy is to build strong relationships with selected retailers globally. Senior management works with executives of our major retail accounts on a regular basis and we believe we are viewed as an important supplier to these customers. Our largest customer, Macys Inc., sells products primarily within the United States and accounted for 11%, 11% and 12% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and 10% and 11% of our accounts receivable as of June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Marketing Our marketing strategy is built around Bringing the Best to Everyone We Touch. Mrs. Estée Lauder formulated this marketing philosophy to provide High-Touch service and high quality products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base. Our marketing efforts focus principally on promoting the quality, value and benefits of our products. Each of our brands is distinctively positioned, has a single global image, and is promoted with consistent logos, packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other brands. We regularly advertise our products on television and radio, in upscale magazines and newspapers, the Internet, and through direct mail and photo displays at international airports. In addition, our products receive extensive editorial coverage in prestige publications and other media worldwide. Promotional activities and in-store displays are designed to introduce existing consumers to different products in the line and to attract new consumers. Our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with retailers, some of which are supported by coordinated promotions, such as purchase with purchase and gift with purchase. Such activities attract consumers to our counters and allow us to introduce them to our products. Our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers and key retailers and consulting with demonstrators at the points of sale. These include Estée Lauder Beauty Advisors, Clinique Consultants, Aramis Selling Specialists, Origins Guides and MAC and Bobbi Brown Makeup Artists. At in-store counters, demonstrators offer consumers a High-Touch experience with personal demonstrations to market individual products as well as to provide education on basic skin care and makeup application. We conduct extensive sampling programs and we pioneered gift with purchase as a sampling program. We believe that the quality and perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers. 5 Table of Contents Our High-Touch approach promotes the total value we offer, by leveraging our in-person and virtual assets, as well as merchandising and education, to provide a customized consumer experience. To support this initiative, we are expanding our efforts to evolve our e-commerce-based online strategy into a multi-pronged digital strategy encompassing e-commerce, as well as digital and social media. We have dedicated resources to implement coordinated, brand-enhancing strategies across all online activities. We use the Internet to educate and inform consumers about certain of our brands. Currently, 18 of our brands have marketing sites, 15 of which have e-commerce capabilities. In order to continue to offer unparalleled customer service and set the standard for prestige beauty shopping online, we partner with key brick and mortar retailers to strengthen their e-commerce business and drive sales of our brands on their sites, continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g., how-to videos, ratings and reviews and mobile phone and tablet applications), and support e-commerce and m-commerce business via digital and social marketing activities designed to build brand equity and consumer engagement. Most of our creative marketing work is done by in-house creative teams. The creative staff designs and produces the sales materials, advertisements and packaging for products in each brand. Global net expenses for advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development costs were $2,345.8 million, $2,015.9 million and $1,878.8 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These amounts include activities relating to purchase with purchase promotions that are reflected in net sales and cost of sales and gift with purchase promotions that are reflected in cost of sales. Information Systems Information systems support business processes including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution and finance. We expect that these systems will continue to provide pertinent inventory and sales data in the short term. However, as part of our long-term effort to enhance these systems and increase productivity, we are implementing our Strategic Modernization Initiative (SMI), which includes an enterprise-wide global program that we expect will deliver a single set of integrated data, processes and technologies, which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands, operating units and sales locations. As part of SMI, we anticipate the continued migration of our operations to SAP, with the majority of our locations being enabled through fiscal 2013. In parallel with our SAP deployment, we are creating a more focused global information technology organization utilizing industry standard processes. We are also taking this opportunity to rebalance our information technology resources to better align with our global business growth. We plan to continue to explore opportunities to create a more efficient organization. Of the many systems currently being utilized, the most significant to our business needs are: (i) a centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer, or plan to offer, which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of consistent quality; (ii) a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the stock keeping unit (SKU) level at most significant retail sales locations (i.e. sell-through data), increasing our understanding of consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development, manufacturing and marketing strategies; (iii) an automated replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers, allowing us to replenish inventories for individual points of sale automatically, with minimal paperwork; and (iv) an inventory management system to provide us with a global view of finished goods availability relative to forecasted requirements. As we continue to modernize our key processes and the related systems and infrastructure, we have recently started the development of upgraded capabilities to support our human resource and retail operations. The initial focus for fiscal 2012 will be in North America. The plan is to progressively deploy these systems globally over the next three years as appropriate according to local requirements and priorities. Research and Development We believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products. Marketing, product development and packaging groups work with our research and development group to identify shifts in consumer preferences, develop new products and improve, redesign or reformulate existing products. In addition, research and development personnel work closely with quality assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis to provide ongoing technical assistance and know-how, to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver products with attributes that fulfill consumer expectations. The research and development group has long-standing working relationships with several U.S. and international medical and educational facilities, which supplement internal capabilities. Members of the group are also responsible for regulatory compliance matters. We do not conduct animal testing on our products or ingredients, nor ask others to test on our behalf, except when required by law. We evaluate our finished products in clinical tests on volunteer panels. As of June 30, 2011, we had approximately 550 employees engaged in research and development. Research and development costs totaled $85.7 million, $79.5 million and $81.6 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We maintain research and development programs at certain of our principal facilities and facilities dedicated to performing research and development, such as our new Shanghai research and development center, see 
