Risk Factors Our business faces significant risks. The risk factors set forth below may not be the only risks that we face and there is a risk that we may have failed to identify all possible risk factors. Additional risks that we are not aware of yet or that currently are not significant may adversely affect our business operations. You should read the following cautionary statements in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other Cirrus Logics filings with the SEC. These cautionary statements are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect the financial condition and results of operations of Cirrus Logic and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies such as ours. We depend on a limited number of customers and distributors for a substantial portion of our sales, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, any key customer or distributor could significantly reduce our sales. While we generate sales from a broad base of customers worldwide, the loss of any of our key customers, or a significant reduction in sales to any one of them, would significantly reduce our sales and adversely affect our business. For the twelve month periods ending March 26, 2011, and March 27, 2010, our ten largest end customers represented approximately 62 percent and 54 percent of our sales, respectively. For the twelve month periods ending March 26, 2011, and March 27, 2010, we had one end customer, Apple Inc., who purchased through multiple contract manufacturers and represented approximately 47 percent and 35 percent of the Companys total sales, respectively. For the twelve month periods ending March 26, 2011, and March 27, 2010, we had one distributor, Avnet Inc., who represented 24 percent and 26 percent of our sales, respectively. We may not be able to maintain or increase sales to certain of our key customers for a variety of reasons, including the following: § most of our customers can stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty; § our agreements with our customers typically do not require them to purchase a minimum quantity of our products; § many of our customers have pre-existing or concurrent relationships with our current or potential competitors that may affect the customers decisions to purchase our products; § our customers face intense competition from other manufacturers that do not use our products; and § our customers regularly evaluate alternative sources of supply in order to diversify their supplier base, which increases their negotiating leverage with us and their ability to obtain components from alternative sources. Page 8 of 71 Table of Contents Our key customer relationships often require us to develop new products that may involve significant technological challenges. Our customers frequently place considerable pressure on us to meet their tight development schedules. In addition, we may from time to time enter into customer agreements providing for exclusivity periods during which we may only sell specified products or technology to that customer. Accordingly, we may have to devote a substantial amount of resources to strategic relationships, which could detract from or delay our completion of other important development projects or the development of next generation products and technologies. In general, our customers may cancel or reschedule orders on short notice without incurring significant penalties; therefore, our sales and operating results in any quarter are difficult to forecast. In general, customers may cancel or reschedule orders on short notice without incurring significant penalties. Therefore, cancellations, reductions, or delays of orders from any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, a significant portion of our sales and earnings in any quarter depends upon customer orders for our products that we receive and fulfill in that quarter. Because our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenue and to a large extent are fixed in the short term, we likely will be unable to adjust spending on a timely basis to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in sales. Accordingly, any significant shortfall of sales in relation to our expectations could hurt our operating results. We are dependent on third-party manufacturing and supply relationships for the majority of our products. Our reliance on third-party foundries and suppliers involves certain risks that may result in increased costs, delays in meeting our customers demand, and loss of revenue. We do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility and do not have the resources to manufacture the majority of our products internally. We depend upon third parties to manufacture, assemble, package and test the majority of our products. As a result, we are subject to risks associated with these third parties, including: § insufficient capacity available to meet our demand; § inadequate manufacturing yields and excessive costs; § inability of these third-parties to obtain an adequate supply of raw materials; § difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors; § limited warranties on products supplied to us; § potential increases in prices; and § increased exposure to potential misappropriation of our intellectual property. Our outside foundries and assembly and test suppliers generally manufacture our products on a purchase order basis, and we have few long-term supply arrangements with these suppliers. Therefore, our third party manufacturers and suppliers are not obligated to supply us with products for any specific period of time, quantity, or price, except as may be provided in any particular purchase order. A manufacturing or supply disruption experienced by one or more of our outside suppliers or a disruption of our relationship with an outside foundry could negatively impact the production of certain of our products for a substantial period of time. In addition, difficulties associated with adapting our technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of outside foundries can lead to reduced yields of our products. Since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures, yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process, and resolution of yield problems may require cooperation between us and our manufacturer. This risk could be compounded by the offshore location of certain of our manufacturers, Page 9 of 71 Table of Contents increasing the effort and time required to identify, communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems. Manufacturing defects that we do not discover during the manufacturing or testing process may lead to costly product recalls. These risks may lead to increased costs or delayed product delivery, which would harm our profitability and customer relationships. In some cases, our requirements may represent a small portion of the total production of the third-party suppliers. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a producer will cease production of an older or lower-volume process that it uses to produce our parts. We cannot assure you that our external foundries will continue to devote resources to the production of parts for our products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products are based. Each of these events could increase our costs, lower our gross margin, cause us to hold more inventories, or materially impact our ability to deliver our products on time. Shifts in industry-wide capacity and our practice of purchasing our products based on sales forecasts may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results. We rely on independent foundries and assembly and test houses to manufacture, or provide components for, our products. Our reliance on these third party suppliers involves certain risks and uncertainties. For example, shifts in industry-wide capacity from shortages to oversupply, or from oversupply to shortages, may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results. We may order wafers and build inventory in advance of receiving purchase orders from our customers. Because our industry is highly cyclical and is subject to significant downturns resulting from excess capacity, overproduction, reduced demand, order cancellations, or technological obsolescence, there is a risk that we will forecast inaccurately and produce excess inventories of particular products. In addition, if we experience supply constraints or manufacturing problems at a particular supplier, we could be required to switch suppliers or qualify additional suppliers. Switching and/or qualifying additional suppliers could be an expensive process and take as long as six to twelve months to complete, which could result in material adverse fluctuations to our operating results. In addition, we generally order our products through non-cancelable purchase orders from third-party foundries based on our sales forecasts, and our customers can generally cancel or reschedule orders they place with us without significant penalties. If we do not receive orders as anticipated by our forecasts, or our customers cancel orders that are placed, we may experience increased inventory levels. Due to the product manufacturing cycle characteristic of IC manufacturing and the inherent imprecision in the accuracy of our customers forecasts, product inventories may not always correspond to product demand, leading to shortages or surpluses of certain products. As a result of such inventory imbalances, future inventory write-downs and charges to gross margin may occur due to lower of cost or market accounting, excess inventory, and inventory obsolescence. Because we depend on subcontractors internationally to perform key manufacturing functions for us, we are subject to political, economic, and natural disaster risks that could disrupt the fabrication, assembly, packaging, or testing of our products. We depend on third-party subcontractors, primarily in Asia, for the fabrication, assembly, packaging, and testing of most of our products. International operations may be subject to a variety of risks, including political instability, global health conditions, currency controls, exchange rate fluctuations, changes in import/export regulations, tariff and freight rates, as well as the risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and floods. Although we seek to reduce our dependence on any one subcontractor, this concentration of subcontractors and manufacturing operations in Asia subjects us to the risks of conducting business internationally, including associated political and economic conditions. If we experience manufacturing problems at a particular location, or a supplier is unable to continue operating due to financial difficulties, natural disasters, or other reasons, we would be required to transfer manufacturing to a backup supplier. Converting or transferring manufacturing from a primary supplier to a backup facility could be expensive and time consuming. As a result, delays in our production or shipping by the parties to whom we outsource these functions could reduce our sales, damage our customer relationships, and damage our reputation in the marketplace, any of which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Page 10 of 71 Table of Contents Our sales could be materially impacted by the failure of other component suppliers to deliver required parts needed in the final assembly of our customers end products. The products we supply our customers are typically a portion of the many components provided from multiple suppliers in order to complete the final assembly of an end product. If one or more of these other component suppliers are unable to deliver their required component(s) in order for the final product to be assembled, our customer may delay, or ultimately cancel, their orders from us. Our products are complex and could contain defects, which could result in material costs to us. Product development in the markets we serve is becoming more focused on the integration of multiple functions on individual devices. There is a general trend towards increasingly complex products. The greater integration of functions and complexity of operations of our products increases the risk that we or our customers or end users could discover latent defects or subtle faults after volumes of product have been shipped. This could result in material costs to us, including, but not limited to: § reduced margins; § damage to our reputation; § a material recall and replacement costs for product warranty and support; § payments to our customer related to the recall claims as a result of various industry or business practices, or in order to maintain good customer relationships; § an adverse impact to our customer relationships by the occurrence of significant defects; § a delay in recognition or loss of revenues, loss of market share, or failure to achieve market acceptance; and § a diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts. In addition, any defects or other problems with our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers who could seek damages from us for their losses. A product liability or warranty claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly to defend. In particular, the sale of systems and components that are incorporated into certain applications for the automotive industry involves a high degree of risk that such claims may be made. While we believe that we are reasonably insured against some of these risks and that we have attempted to contractually limit our financial exposure with many of our customers, a warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established reserves, or a requirement that we participate in a customer product recall, would have adverse effects (that could be material) on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Costs related to product defects and errata may harm our results of operations and business. Costs associated with unexpected product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) due to, for example, unanticipated problems in our design and manufacturing processes, could include: § writing off the value of inventory of such products; § disposing of products that cannot be fixed; § recalling such products that have been shipped to customers; § providing product replacements for, or modifications to, such products; and § defending against litigation related to such products. These costs could be substantial and may increase our expenses and lower our profitability. In addition, our reputation with our customers or users of our products could be damaged as a result of such product defects and errata, and the demand for our products could be reduced. The announcement of product defects Page 11 of 71 Table of Contents and/or errata could cause customers to purchase products from our competitors as a result of anticipated shortages of our components or for other reasons. These factors could harm our financial results and the prospects for our business. As we carry only limited insurance coverage, any incurred liability resulting from uncovered claims could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance policies may not be adequate to fully offset losses from covered incidents, and we do not have coverage for certain losses. For example, there is limited coverage available with respect to the services provided by our third party foundries and assembly and test subcontractors. Although we believe that our existing insurance coverage is consistent with common practices of companies in our industry, our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us against product recalls, natural disasters, and other unforeseen catastrophes that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have historically experienced fluctuations in our operating results and expect these fluctuations to continue in future periods, which may result in volatility in our stock price. Our quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect our net sales, gross margin, and operating results. If our operating results fall below expectations of market analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. We are subject to business cycles and it is difficult to predict the timing, length, or volatility of these cycles. These business cycles may create pressure on our sales, gross margin, and/or operating results. Factors that could cause fluctuations and materially and adversely affect our net sales, gross margin and operating results include, but are not limited to: § the volume and timing of orders received; § changes in the mix of our products sold; § market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers; § excess or obsolete inventory; § competitive pricing pressures; § our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis; § the timing and extent of our research and development expenses; § the failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements; § disruption in the supply of wafers, assembly, or test services; § reduction of manufacturing yields; § certain production and other risks associated with using independent manufacturers, assembly houses, and testers; and § product obsolescence, price erosion, competitive developments, and other competitive factors. We may be adversely impacted by current global economic conditions. As a result, our financial results and the market price of our common shares may decline. Current global economic conditions could make it difficult for our customers, our suppliers, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and could cause global businesses to defer or reduce spending on our products, or increase the costs of manufacturing our products. During challenging economic times our customers and distributors may face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could impact their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to occur, we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding would increase. Page 12 of 71 Table of Contents We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery. If the economy or markets in which we operate were to deteriorate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will likely be materially and/or adversely affected. Our results may be affected by the fluctuation in sales in the consumer entertainment market. Because we sell products in the consumer entertainment market, we are likely to be affected by seasonality in the sales of our products. Further, a decline in consumer confidence and consumer spending relating to economic conditions, terrorist attacks, armed conflicts, oil prices, global health conditions, natural disasters, and/or the political stability of countries that we operate in or sell into could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our products may be subject to average selling prices that decline over short time periods. If we are unable to increase our volumes, introduce new or enhanced products with higher selling prices, or reduce our costs, our business and operating results could be harmed. Historically in the semiconductor industry, average selling prices of products have decreased over time. If the average selling price of any of our products decline and we are unable to increase our unit volumes, introduce new or enhanced products with higher margins, and/or reduce manufacturing costs to offset anticipated decreases in the prices of our existing products, our operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, because of procurement lead times, we are limited in our ability to reduce total costs quickly in response to any sales shortfalls. Because of these factors, we may experience material adverse fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that gain market acceptance could harm our operating results. Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products for new and existing markets, to introduce these products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and to have these products gain market acceptance. New product introductions involve significant investment of resources and potential risks. Delays in new product introductions or less-than-anticipated market acceptance of our new products are possible and would have an adverse effect on our sales and earnings. The development of new products is highly complex and, from time-to-time, we have experienced delays in developing and introducing these new products. Successful product development and introduction depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to: § proper new product definition; § timely completion of design and testing of new products; § assisting our customers with integration of our components into their new products, including providing support from the concept stage through design, launch and production ramp; § successfully developing and implementing the software necessary to integrate our products into our customers products; § achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields; § availability of wafer fabrication, assembly, and test capacity; § market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers; and § obtaining and retaining industry certification requirements. Both sales and margins may be materially affected if new product introductions are delayed, or if our products are not designed into successive generations of new or existing customers products. We may not be able to meet these challenges, or adjust to changing market conditions as quickly and cost-effectively as necessary to compete successfully. Our failure to develop and introduce new products successfully could harm our business and operating results. Page 13 of 71 Table of Contents Successful product design and development is dependent on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified design engineers, of which there is a limited number. Due to the complexity and variety of analog and high-precision analog and mixed-signal circuits, the limited number of qualified integrated circuit designers and the limited effectiveness of computer-aided design systems in the design of analog and mixed-signal ICs, we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis. We have significant international sales, and risks associated with these sales could harm our operating results. Export sales, principally to Asia, include sales to U.S-based customers with manufacturing plants overseas and represented 82 percent, 79 percent, and 68 percent of our net sales in fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. We expect export sales to continue to represent a significant portion of product sales. This reliance on international sales subjects us to the risks of conducting business internationally, including risks associated with political and economic instability, global health conditions, currency controls, exchange rate fluctuations and changes in import/export regulations, tariff and freight rates, as well as the risks of natural disaster, especially in Asia. For example, the financial instability in a given region may have an adverse impact on the financial position of end users in the region, which could affect future orders and harm our results of operations. Our international sales operations involve a number of other risks including, but not limited to: § unexpected changes in government regulatory requirements; § changes to countries banking and credit requirements; § changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; § delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for technology; § tariffs and other barriers and restrictions; § competition with non-U.S. companies or other domestic companies entering the non-U.S. markets in which we operate; § longer sales and payment cycles; § problems in collecting accounts receivable; § political instability; and § the burdens of complying with a variety of non-U.S. laws. In addition, our competitive position may be affected by the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Consequently, increases in the value of the dollar would increase the price in local currencies of our products in non-U.S. markets and make our products relatively more expensive. Alternatively, decreases in the value of the dollar will increase the relative cost of our and our vendors operations that are based overseas. We cannot provide assurances that regulatory, political and other factors will not adversely affect our operations in the future or require us to modify our current business practices. We are subject to the export control regulations of the U.S. Department of State and the Department of Commerce. A violation of these export control regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. The nature of our international business, and in particular, the manufacture and sale of certain products from our Apex Precision Power Product line, subjects us to the export control regulations of the U.S. Department of State and the Department of Commerce. If these export control regulations are violated, it could result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges. The government is very strict with respect to compliance and has served notice generally that failure to comply with these regulations may subject guilty parties to fines and/or imprisonment. Although we are not aware of any material violation of any export control regulations, a failure to comply with any of the above mentioned regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. Page 14 of 71 Table of Contents Our international operations subject our business to additional political and economic risks that could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition to export sales constituting a large portion of our net sales, we maintain international operations, sales, and technical support personnel. International expansion has required, and will continue to require, significant management attention and resources. There are risks inherent in expanding our presence into non-U.S. regions, including, but not limited to: § difficulties in staffing and managing non-U.S. operations; § failure of non-U.S. laws to adequately protect our U.S. intellectual property, patent, trademarks, copyrights know-how and other proprietary rights; § global health conditions and potential natural disasters; § political and economic instability in international regions; § international currency controls and exchange rate fluctuations; § vulnerability to terrorist groups targeting American interests abroad; and § legal uncertainty regarding liability and compliance with non-U.S. laws and regulatory requirements. If we are unable to successfully manage the demands of our international operations, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our failure to manage our distribution channel relationships could adversely affect our business. The future of our business, as well as the future growth of our business, will depend in part on our ability to manage our relationships with current and future distributors and external sales representatives and to develop additional channels for the distribution and sale of our products. The inability to successfully manage these relationships could adversely affect our business. Strong competition in the semiconductor market may harm our business. The IC industry is intensely competitive and is frequently characterized by rapid technological change, price erosion, technological obsolescence, and a push towards IC component integration. Because of shortened product life cycles and even shorter design-in cycles in a number of the markets that we serve, our competitors have increasingly frequent opportunities to achieve design wins in next-generation systems. In the event that competitors succeed in supplanting our products, our market share may not be sustainable and our net sales, gross margin and operating results would be adversely affected. Additionally, further component integration could eliminate the need for our products. We compete in a number of fragmented markets. Our principal competitors in these markets include AKM Semiconductor Inc., Analog Devices Inc., Austriamicrosystems AG, Freescale Semiconductor Inc., Integrated Device Technology Inc., iWatt Inc., Infineon Technologies AG, Linear Technologies Corporation, Maxim Integrated Products Inc., NXP Semiconductors N.V., ON Semiconductor Corporation, Power Integrations Inc., Realtek Semiconductor Corporation, ST Microelectronics N.V., Texas Instruments, Inc., and Wolfson Microelectronics plc. Many of these competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, technical, distribution, and other resources; broader product lines; broader intellectual property portfolios; and longer relationships with customers. We also expect intensified competition from emerging companies and from customers who develop their own IC products. In addition, some of our current and future competitors maintain their own fabrication facilities, which could benefit them in connection with cost, capacity, and technical issues. Increased competition could adversely affect our business. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in the future or that competitive pressures will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Competitive pressures could reduce market acceptance of our products and result in price reductions and increases in expenses that could adversely affect our business and our financial condition. Page 15 of 71 Table of Contents We may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and to preserve our other intellectual property rights covering our products. We seek patent protection for those inventions and technologies for which we believe such protection is suitable and is likely to provide a competitive advantage to us. We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary technology, non-disclosure and other contractual terms, and technical measures to protect our technology and manufacturing knowledge. We work actively to foster continuing technological innovation to maintain and protect our competitive position. We cannot provide assurances that steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will be adequate, that our competitors will not independently develop or design around our patents, or that our intellectual property will not be misappropriated. In addition, the laws of some non-U.S. countries may not protect our intellectual property as well as the laws of the United States. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Policing infringement of our technology is difficult, and litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any such litigation could be expensive, take significant time, and divert managements attention from other business concerns. Potential intellectual property claims and litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages and could invalidate our proprietary rights. The IC industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We may find it necessary to initiate a lawsuit to assert our patent or other intellectual property rights. These legal proceedings could be expensive, take significant time, and divert managements attention from other business concerns. We cannot provide assurances that we will ultimately be successful in any lawsuit, nor can we provide assurances that any patent owned by us will not be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. We cannot provide assurances that rights granted under our patents will provide competitive advantages to us, or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all. As is typical in the IC industry, we and our customers have, from time to time, received and may in the future receive, communications from third parties asserting patents, mask work rights, or copyrights. In the event third parties were to make a valid intellectual property claim and a license was not available on commercially reasonable terms, our operating results could be harmed. Litigation, which could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our management, technical and financial resources, may also be necessary to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others. An unfavorable outcome in any such suit could have an adverse effect on our future operations and/or liquidity. If we fail to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, we may not be able to develop, market, or sell our products or successfully manage our business. Competition for highly qualified personnel in our industry is intense. The number of technology companies in the geographic areas in which we operate is greater than it has been historically and we expect competition for qualified personnel to intensify. There are only a limited number of people in the job market with the requisite skills. Our Human Resources organization focuses significant efforts on attracting and retaining individuals in key technology positions. The loss of the services of key personnel or our inability to hire new personnel with the requisite skills could restrict our ability to develop new products or enhance existing products in a timely manner, sell products to our customers, or manage our business effectively. We may acquire other companies or technologies, which may create additional risks associated with our ability to successfully integrate them into our business. We continue to consider future acquisitions of other companies, or their technologies or products, to improve our market position, broaden our technological capabilities, and expand our product offerings. If we are able to acquire companies, products or technologies that would enhance our business, we could experience Page 16 of 71 Table of Contents difficulties in integrating them. Integrating acquired businesses involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to: § the potential disruption of our ongoing business; § unexpected costs or incurring unknown liabilities; § the diversion of management resources from other strategic and operational issues; § the inability to retain the employees of the acquired businesses; § difficulties relating to integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses; § adverse effects on the existing customer relationships of acquired companies; § the potential incompatibility of business cultures; § adverse effects associated with entering into markets and acquiring technologies in areas in which we have little experience; and § acquired intangible assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired company. If we are unable to successfully address any of these risks, our business could be harmed. Future transactions may limit our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards. As of March 26, 2011, we had U.S. federal tax net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $423.7 million. These NOL carryforwards may be used to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our U.S. federal income taxes otherwise payable. There is a risk we may not be able to generate taxable income in the future in the amount necessary to fully utilize all of these NOLs. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), imposes an annual limit on the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its NOL carry forwards to reduce its tax liability. If we were at some point in the future to experience an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Code, our use of the net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards may be limited as described in the Code. Our financial results may be adversely affected by changes in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. The Company has a significant amount of deferred tax assets. Our ability to recognize these deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize, or actually use, these deferred tax assets. That determination depends primarily on our ability to generate future U.S. taxable income. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require possible material adjustments to the net deferred tax asset and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period in which such determinations are made. Our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. The market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly. This fluctuation has been or may be the result of numerous factors, including, but not limited to: § actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; § announcements concerning our business or those of our competitors, customers, or suppliers; § loss of a significant customer, or customers; § changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform as anticipated by the analysts; Page 17 of 71 Table of Contents § news, commentary, and rumors emanating from the media relating to us, our customers, or the industry. These reports may be unrelated to the actual operating performance of the company, and in some cases, may be potentially misleading or incorrect; § announcements regarding technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors; § announcements by us of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitment; § announcements by us of significant divestitures or sale of certain assets or intellectual property; § litigation arising out of a wide variety of matters, including, among others, employment matters and intellectual property matters; § departure of key personnel; § single significant stockholders selling for any reason; § general conditions in the IC industry; and § general market conditions and interest rates. We have provisions in our certification of incorporation and Bylaws, and are subject to certain provisions of Delaware law, which could prevent, delay or impede a change of control of our company. These provisions could affect the market price of our stock. Certain provisions of Delaware law and of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if our stockholders support the acquisition. These provisions include, but are not limited to: § the inability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; § a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; and § a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders. We are also subject to the anti-takeover laws of Delaware that may prevent, delay or impede a third party from acquiring or merging with us, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We are subject to the risks of owning real property. We have purchased land for the purpose of building our U.S. headquarters in Austin, Texas, and we own our facility in Tucson, Arizona. The purchase of land and the current construction of our U.S. headquarters, along with the ownership of our facility in Tucson, subject us to the risks of owning real property, which may include: § the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with correcting any environmental problems; § adverse changes in the value of these properties, due to interest rate changes, changes in the neighborhood in which the property is located, or other factors; § increased cash commitments for constructing a new building in Austin, Texas, or improving the current building and property in Tucson, Arizona; and § the risk of financial loss in excess of amounts covered by insurance, or uninsured risks, such as the loss caused by damage to the buildings as a result of fire, floods, or other natural disasters.
