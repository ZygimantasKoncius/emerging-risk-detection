ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to other information in this report, the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating an investment in our securities. We believe the following risks and uncertainties, along with the risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including those described above under BUSINESSCompetition,Patents and Proprietary Rights,Manufacturing,Marketing and Sales,Government Regulation,Product Liability,Employees and under MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources are the material risks and uncertainties we face at the present time. If any of the risks or uncertainties described in this Form 10-K actually occurs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties 22 of which we are unaware or currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business. We depend heavily on King Pharmaceuticals for the successful commercialization of GLUMETZA in the United States. In June 2006, we entered into a promotion agreement with King Pharmaceuticals pursuant to which King promotes GLUMETZA in the United States through its sales force. Under the agreement, in exchange for promotion fees, King is required to promote GLUMETZA to physicians in the United States, to deliver a minimum number of annual detail calls to potential GLUMETZA prescribers, and to maintain a sales force of a minimum size. Although we have retained rights to promote GLUMETZA to certain physicians and to retain revenues from incremental sales generated by physicians we call upon, we have not yet established a sales force, or contracted with a third party to act as our sales force, and we do not have immediate plans to do so. Accordingly, the success of the initial commercialization of GLUMETZA will depend in large part on the efforts of Kings sales force in the promotion of the product. Factors that may affect the success of our promotion arrangement with King include the following: · King may acquire or develop alternative products; · King may pursue higher-priority programs, or change the focus of its marketing programs; · King may in the future choose to devote fewer resources to GLUMETZA; · GLUMETZA may fail to achieve market acceptance; and · King may fail to comply with its obligations under our promotion agreement. Any of the preceding factors could affect Kings commitment to the collaboration, which, in turn, could adversely affect the commercial success of GLUMETZA. Any failure to successfully commercialize GLUMETZA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. We are responsible for the distribution of GLUMETZA, and we have limited experience with distribution of pharmaceutical products. We are responsible for the distribution of GLUMETZA, which is the first product that we have distributed ourselves. Although we have enhanced our in-house commercial operations and distribution capabilities in connection with the commercial launch of GLUMETZA, our internal resources remain limited. In addition, we have entered into distribution arrangements with third parties related to GLUMETZA, including Cardinal Health, AmeriSource Bergen and McKesson, and we will depend on them to ensure that GLUMETZA is widely available to support its commercial availability. To continue to support our commercialization effort related to GLUMETZA and any other product we choose to market and distribute, we must continue to enhance our internal commercial infrastructure, and continue to contract with capable third parties to assist us in our commercialization efforts. The development of that infrastructure will also require substantial resources, which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel. The efforts of third parties with whom we contract for distribution of our products may not be successful. Any failure on our part to successfully develop distribution capabilities could cause delays in product sales and incur increased costs. We have limited in-house sales and marketing resources, which we will require in order to successfully co-promote GLUMETZA and ProQuin XR through our own sales force. Although we have the right to co-promote GLUMETZA and ProQuin XR through our own sales force, or through third parties, we have no sales force and limited marketing and sales staff. The success of 23 our own promotion efforts for GLUMETZA, ProQuin XR and any other product candidates that receive regulatory approval that we choose to market or co-market will require that we substantially enhance our in-house marketing and sales force with technical expertise, or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us. The development of the infrastructure associated with these activities involves substantial resources, and considerable attention of our management and key personnel. To the extent that we enter into marketing and sales arrangements with other companies, our revenues will depend on the efforts of others. These efforts may not be successful. If we fail to fully develop marketing and sales capabilities, or enter into arrangements with third parties, our revenues may suffer. We depend on Esprit Pharma for the successful commercialization of ProQuin XR in the United States. Esprit has exclusive marketing rights to ProQuin XR in the United States. Esprit launched ProQuin XR in November 2005. In July 2006, we agreed to extend to December 2006 the due date on the $10 million license fee payment to Depomed that had been due in July 2006. In December 2006, we did not receive the license fee payment on its due date, and we initiated arbitration proceedings related to alleged breaches by Esprit of our license agreement with Esprit. Later in December 2006, Esprit paid us the $10 million license fee payment and we withdrew without prejudice the notice and demand for arbitration. We also agreed to commence, in January 2007, discussions with Esprit toward a mutually agreeable, long-term restructuring of the license agreement. Those discussions began in January 2007 and are continuing. The result of those discussions is uncertain, and we may not be able to negotiate mutually agreeable modifications to the license agreement. Esprit is a private company with a limited operating history and has not yet established a proven track record of successfully commercializing its products. In addition, Esprit has limited financial resources relative to many other pharmaceutical companies. Any financial difficulties experienced by Esprit, or complications in the promotion of ProQuin XR or Esprits other products, or execution of its business plan, may adversely affect the ProQuin XR commercialization effort and Esprits ability to comply with its obligations to us under our license agreement. If Esprit fails to successfully commercialize ProQuin XR, or to comply with its obligations under our license agreement, including its future license fee and minimum royalty obligations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We depend on our marketing partners for the successful commercialization of GLUMETZA in Canada and Korea, and of ProQuin XR in Europe. We have licensed exclusive marketing rights to the 500mg GLUMETZA in Canada to Biovail, and in Korea to LG Life Sciences. Biovail launched the 500mg GLUMETZA in Canada in November 2005, and LG launched the 500mg GLUMETZA in Korea in 2006 under the trade name Novamet GR. We have also entered into a supply and distribution agreement with Madaus related to the commercialization of ProQuin XR in Europe. If Biovail or LG fails to successfully commercialize GLUMETZA in Canada, our business and future revenues may be adversely affected. Our product candidates are at early stages of development and may not be successful or achieve market acceptance. We have completed enrollment of a Phase 3 clinical trial of Gabapentin GR for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, and we have completed a Phase 2 trial of Gabapentin GR for diabetic neuropathy. In 2007, we expect to initiate a clinical development program for Gabapentin GR for the treatment of hot flashes associated with menopause, and to advance the clinical development program of our gastroesophageal reflux disease product candidate. In addition, we expect to submit before the end of the first quarter of 2007 a supplemental NDA filing for the new 1000mg formulation of GLUMETZA for 24 which we have an exclusive license in the United States. We have other product candidates in earlier stages of development. Our own product candidates and those of our collaborative partners are subject to the risk that any or all of them are found to be ineffective or unsafe, or otherwise may fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances. We are unable to predict whether any of these other product candidates will receive regulatory clearances or be successfully manufactured or marketed. Further, due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before marketing clearance can be obtained, the time frames for commercialization of any products are long and uncertain. Even if these other product candidates receive regulatory clearance, our products may not achieve or maintain market acceptance. Also, substantially all of our product candidates, other than the 1000mg formulation of GLUMETZA, use the AcuForm technology. If it is discovered that the AcuForm technology could have adverse effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective as a delivery system for drugs or therapeutics, our product development efforts and our business would be significantly harmed. We are expecting operating losses in the future. To date, we have had limited revenues from license fees, product sales, royalties, collaborative research and development arrangements and feasibility studies. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we had total revenues of $9.6 million and for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had total revenues of $4.4 million and $200,000, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred net losses of $39.7 million and for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we incurred net losses of $24.5 million and $26.9 million, respectively. As we incur increasing expenses related to the commercialization of GLUMETZA, continue our research and development efforts, preclinical testing and clinical trial activities, and expand our sales and marketing organization, we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next year. Therefore, we expect our cumulative losses to increase. These losses, among other things, have had, and we expect that they will continue to have, an adverse impact on our total assets, shareholders equity and working capital. Our operating results may fluctuate and affect our stock price. The following factors will affect our operating results and may result in a material adverse effect on our stock price: · the degree of commercial success of GLUMETZA and ProQuin XR; · our collaborative partners compliance or non-compliance with their obligations under our agreements with them; · results of clinical trials for our product candidates; · regulatory actions; · results of litigation, including our pending litigation against IVAX Corporation; · developments concerning proprietary rights, including patents, infringement allegations and litigation matters; · variations in revenues obtained from collaborative agreements, including milestone payments, royalties, license fees and other contract revenues; · decisions by collaborative partners to proceed or not to proceed with subsequent phases of a collaboration or program; · market acceptance of the AcuForm technology; · adoption of new technologies by us or our competitors; 25 · the introduction of new products by our competitors; · manufacturing costs and difficulties; · changes in government funding; · third-party reimbursement policies; and · the status of our compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our collaborative arrangements may give rise to disputes over commercial terms, contract interpretation and ownership of our intellectual property and may adversely affect the commercial success of our products. We currently have a collaboration agreement for development of product candidates through the feasibility phase with New River Pharmaceuticals, and we have a collaboration arrangement with Patheon, Inc. related to the potential development of product candidates for third parties. We also have a collaboration agreement with Supernus, Inc. providing for the development of a product candidate through feasibility, with the possibility to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the further development of the product candidate, by either or both parties. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future enter into other collaborative arrangements, some of which have been based on less definitive agreements, such as memoranda of understanding, material transfer agreements, options or feasibility agreements. We may not execute definitive agreements formalizing these arrangements. Collaborative relationships are generally complex and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of the parties, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations, especially when the applicable collaborative provisions have not been fully negotiated and documented. Such disputes can delay collaborative research, development or commercialization of potential products, and can lead to lengthy, expensive litigation or arbitration. The terms of collaborative arrangements may also limit or preclude us from developing products or technologies developed pursuant to such collaborations. Additionally, the collaborators under these arrangements might breach the terms of their respective agreements or fail to prevent infringement of the licensed patents by third parties. Moreover, negotiating collaborative arrangements often takes considerably longer to conclude than the parties initially anticipate, which could cause us to agree to less favorable agreement terms that delay or defer recovery of our development costs and reduce the funding available to support key programs. We may be unable to enter into future collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms, which would harm our ability to develop and commercialize our current and potential future products. Further, even if we do enter into collaboration arrangements, it is possible that our collaborative partners may not choose to develop and commercialize products using the AcuForm technology. Other factors relating to collaborations that may adversely affect the commercial success of our products include: · any parallel development by a collaborative partner of competitive technologies or products; · arrangements with collaborative partners that limit or preclude us from developing products or technologies; · premature termination of a collaboration agreement; or · failure by a collaborative partner to devote sufficient resources to the development and commercial sales of products using the AcuForm technology. 26 Generally, our collaborative arrangements do not restrict our collaborative partners from competing with us or restrict their ability to market or sell competitive products. Our current and any future collaborative partners may pursue existing or other development-stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. Our collaborative partners may also terminate their collaborative relationships with us or otherwise decide not to proceed with development and commercialization of our products. Our licensed patent covering the use of gabapentin to treat hot flashes associated with menopause is a method-of-use patent, which increases the risk that prescriptions for gabapentin to treat hot flashes in menopausal women could be written for, or filled with, generic gabapentin. We have an exclusive sublicense from PharmaNova, Inc. to a patent held by the University of Rochester to develop and commercialize in the United States a gabapentin product for the treatment of hot flashes associated with menopause in women. Because a method-of-use patent, such as the patent we have sublicensed from PharmaNova, covers only a specified use of a particular compound, not a particular composition of matter, we cannot prevent others from commercializing gabapentin. Accordingly, physicians could prescribe another manufacturers gabapentin to treat hot flashes in menopausal women rather than Gabapentin GR, or pharmacists could seek to fill prescriptions for Gabapentin GR with another manufacturers gabapentin. Although any such off-label use would violate our licensed patent, effectively monitoring compliance with our licensed patent may be difficult and costly. It is difficult to develop a successful product. If we do not develop a successful product we may be unable to raise additional funds. The drug development process is costly, time-consuming and subject to unpredictable delays and failures. Before we or others make commercial sales of products using the AcuForm technology, other than GLUMETZA and ProQuin XR, we, our current and any future collaborative partners will need to: · conduct preclinical and clinical tests showing that these products are safe and effective; and · obtain regulatory approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. We will have to curtail, redirect or eliminate our product development programs if we or our collaborative partners find that: · our drug delivery technology has unintended or undesirable side effects; or · product candidates that appear promising in preclinical or early-stage clinical studies do not demonstrate efficacy in later-stage, larger scale clinical trials. Even when or if our products obtain regulatory approval, successful commercialization requires: · market acceptance; · cost-effective commercial scale production; and · reimbursement under private or governmental health plans. Any material delay or failure in the governmental approval process and/or the commercialization of our potential products would adversely impact our financial position and liquidity and would make it difficult for us to raise financing on favorable terms, if at all. 27 If we do not achieve our projected development and commercialization goals in the timeframes we announce and expect, the commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed and our business will be harmed and our stock price may decline. For planning purposes, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development and commercialization goals. These milestones may include our expectations regarding the commercial launch of our products by us or our licensees, and the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings. From time to time, we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones, such as the completion of our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of Gabapentin GR, or the submission of the supplemental NDA covering the 1000mg formulation of GLUMETZA. All of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary considerably from our estimates depending on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: · our available capital resources; · the efforts of our marketing partners with respect to the commercialization of our products; · the rate of progress, costs and results of our clinical trial and research and development activities, including the extent of scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions and our ability to identify and enroll patients who meet clinical trial eligibility criteria; · our receipt of approvals by the FDA and other regulatory agencies and the timing thereof; · other actions by regulators; · our ability to access sufficient, reliable and affordable supplies of components used in the manufacture of our product candidates, including insulin and materials for our AcuForm technology; and · the costs of ramping up and maintaining manufacturing operations, as necessary. If we fail to achieve our announced milestones in the timeframes we announce and expect, our business and results of operations may be harmed and the price of our stock may decline. We depend on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our clinical trials and other third parties to manage the trials and to perform related data collection and analysis, and, as a result, we may face costs and delays outside of our control. We rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients and other third parties to manage our trials and to perform related data collection and analysis. However, we may be unable to control the amount and timing of resources that the clinical sites that conduct the clinical testing may devote to our clinical trials. If our clinical investigators and clinical sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials or fail to enroll them on our planned schedule, we will be unable to complete these trials or to complete them as planned, which could delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates. Our agreements with clinical investigators and clinical sites for clinical testing and for trial management services place substantial responsibilities on these parties, which could result in delays in, or termination of, our clinical trials if these parties fail to perform as expected. For example, if any of our clinical trial sites fail to comply with FDA-approved good clinical practices, we may be unable to use the data gathered at those sites. If these clinical investigators, clinical sites or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for 28 other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our product candidates. If we are unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approval, we will be limited in our ability to commercialize our products, and our business will be harmed. The regulatory process is expensive and time consuming. Even after investing significant time and expenditures on clinical trials, we may not obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates. Data obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval, and the FDA may not agree with our methods of clinical data analysis or our conclusions regarding safety and/or efficacy. Significant clinical trial delays would impair our ability to commercialize our products and could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do. In addition, changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review of each submitted new application may cause delays or rejections. Even if we receive regulatory approval, this approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which we can market a product. Further, with respect to our approved products, once regulatory approval is obtained, a marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review. The discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or manufacturing facility, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Manufacturers of approved products are also subject to ongoing regulation, including compliance with FDA regulations governing current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Failure to comply with manufacturing regulations can result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution. Pharmaceutical marketing is subject to substantial regulation in the United States. All marketing activities associated with ProQuin XR and GLUMETZA, as well as marketing activities related to any other products for which we obtain regulatory approval, will be subject to numerous federal and state laws governing the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products. The FDA regulates post-approval promotional labeling and advertising to ensure that they conform to statutory and regulatory requirements. In addition to FDA restrictions, the marketing of prescription drugs is subject to laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse under government healthcare programs. For example, the federal healthcare program antikickback statute prohibits giving things of value to induce the prescribing or purchase of products that are reimbursed by federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government. Under this law, the federal government in recent years has brought claims against drug manufacturers alleging that certain marketing activities caused false claims for prescription drugs to be submitted to federal programs. Many states have similar statutes or regulations, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in some states, regardless of the payer. If we, or our collaborative partners, fail to comply with applicable FDA regulations or other laws or regulations relating to the marketing of our products, we could be subject to criminal prosecution, civil penalties, seizure of products, injunction, and exclusion of our products from reimbursement under government programs, as well as other regulatory actions against our product candidates, our collaborative partners or us. 29 The approval process outside the United States is uncertain and may limit our ability to develop, manufacture and sell our products internationally. To market any of our products outside of the United States, we and our collaborative partners, including Madaus, are subject to numerous and varying foreign regulatory requirements, implemented by foreign health authorities, governing the design and conduct of human clinical trials and marketing approval for drug products. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval set forth above, and approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by the health authorities of any other country, nor does the approval by foreign health authorities ensure approval by the FDA. If we or our marketing partners are unable to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for our products from third-party payers, we will be unable to generate significant revenues. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our product candidates will depend in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third-party payers such as: · government health administration authorities; · private health insurers; · health maintenance organizations; · pharmacy benefit management companies; and · other healthcare-related organizations. If reimbursement is not available for our products or product candidates, demand for these products may be limited. Further, any delay in receiving approval for reimbursement from third-party payers would have an adverse effect on our future revenues. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products, including pharmaceuticals. Our products may not be considered cost effective, and adequate third-party reimbursement may be unavailable to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an acceptable return on our investment. Federal and state governments in the United States and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare. Existing regulations affecting pricing may also change before many of our product candidates are approved for marketing. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product we may develop. We may be unable to compete successfully in the pharmaceutical product and drug delivery system industries. Other companies that have oral drug delivery technologies competitive with the AcuForm technology include Bristol-Myers Squibb, IVAX Corporation (a subsidiary of TEVA Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd.), ALZA Corporation (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), SkyePharma plc, Biovail Corporation, Flamel Technologies S.A., Ranbaxy Laboratories, Ltd., Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Intec Pharma and Alpharma, Inc., all of which develop oral tablet products designed to release the incorporated drugs over time. Each of these companies has patented technologies with attributes different from ours, and in some cases with different sites of delivery to the gastrointestinal tract. Bristol-Myers Squibb is currently marketing a sustained release formulation of metformin, Glucophage XR, with which GLUMETZA competes. The limited license that Bristol-Myers Squibb obtained from us under our November 2002 settlement agreement extends to certain current and 30 internally-developed future compounds, which may increase the likelihood that we will face competition from Bristol-Myers Squibb in the future on products in addition to GLUMETZA. Several other companies, including Barr Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Mylan Laboratories, Inc. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. have received FDA approval for and are selling a controlled-release metformin product. Flamel Technologies has a controlled-release microparticle-based formulation of metformin product in Phase 2 clinical trials. Bayer Corporation developed a once-daily ciprofloxacin product for the treatment of urinary tract infections, which is currently marketed by Schering-Plough Corporation. There may be other companies developing products competitive with GLUMETZA and ProQuin XR of which we are unaware. Gabapentin is currently marketed by Pfizer as Neurontin for adjunctive therapy for epileptic seizures and for postherpetic pain. Pfizers basic U.S. patents relating to Neurontin have expired, and at least seven companies have received approval to market generic versions of the immediate release product. In addition, Pfizer has developed a new product, Lyrica (pregabalin), which has been approved for marketing in the U.S. and the European Union. Competition in pharmaceutical products and drug delivery systems is intense. We expect competition to increase. Competing technologies or products developed in the future may prove superior to the AcuForm technology or products using the AcuForm technology, either generally or in particular market segments. These developments could make the AcuForm technology or products using the AcuForm technology noncompetitive or obsolete. Most of our principal competitors have substantially greater financial, sales, marketing, personnel and research and development resources than we do. In addition, many of our potential collaborative partners have devoted, and continue to devote, significant resources to the development of their own drug delivery systems and technologies. We depend on third parties who are single source suppliers to manufacture ProQuin XR, GLUMETZA and our later stage product candidates. If these suppliers are unable to manufacture ProQuin XR, GLUMETZA or our product candidates, our business will be harmed. We are responsible for the supply and distribution of GLUMETZA, and MOVA Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Patheon, Inc., is our sole supplier for tablets of the 500mg strength of GLUMETZA pursuant to a supply agreement we entered into with MOVA Pharmaceuticals in December 2006. We purchase the active ingredient for the 500mg GLUMETZA from Farmhispania, S.A., a sole supplier to us, on a purchase order basis. If the new formulation of 1000mg GLUMETZA is approved, we will rely on Biovail as our sole supplier. We will be unable to manufacture GLUMETZA in a timely manner if we are unable to obtain GLUMETZA 500mg tablets from our contract manufacturer or active pharmaceutical ingredient from suppliers, or GLUMETZA 1000mg tablets from Biovail. We are also responsible for supplying commercial quantities of ProQuin XR to Esprit. For the manufacture of ProQuin XR tablets, we have entered into an agreement with MOVA Pharmaceuticals, as our sole supplier. Uquifa Mexico, S.A., our supplier of the active pharmaceutical ingredient to ProQuin XR, is also a sole supplier to us. We obtain the active pharmaceutical ingredient to ProQuin XR on a purchase order basis only. We will also be responsible for the manufacture of bulk ProQuin XR tablets to Madaus for the European market, if the product is approved for marketing in European jurisdictions. We intend to purchase ProQuin XR tablets from MOVA Pharmaceuticals for that purpose If we are unable, for whatever reason, to obtain the active pharmaceutical ingredient or ProQuin XR tablets from our contract manufacturers, we may be unable to manufacture ProQuin XR in a timely manner, if at all. 31 Although we have obtained clinical batches of Gabapentin GR from a contract manufacturer, we currently have no long-term supply arrangement with respect to Gabapentin GR. Any failure to obtain clinical supplies of Gabapentin GR could adversely affect our Gabapentin clinical development programs. We could become subject to product liability litigation and may not have adequate insurance to cover product liability claims. Our business involves exposure to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the production and manufacture of pharmaceutical products. We have obtained product liability insurance for clinical trials currently underway and forecasted 2007 sales of our products, but: · we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance for future trials; · we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance for future products; · we may be unable to maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms; · we may be unable to secure increased coverage as the commercialization of the AcuForm technology proceeds; or · our insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products. Defending a lawsuit would be costly and significantly divert managements attention from conducting our business. If third parties were to bring a successful product liability claim or series of claims against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liability limits, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. If we choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products or technologies, we may be unable to complete these acquisitions or to successfully integrate them in a cost effective and non-disruptive manner. Our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands, competitive pressures and technologies. Accordingly, we may in the future pursue the acquisition of complementary businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves. We have no current commitments with respect to any acquisition or such investment. We do not know if we would be able to successfully complete any acquisitions, or whether we would be able to successfully integrate any acquired business, product or technology or retain any key employees. Integrating any business, product or technology we acquire could be expensive and time consuming, disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management. If we were to be unable to integrate any acquired businesses, products or technologies effectively, our business would suffer. In addition, any amortization or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could harm our operating results. We have implemented certain anti-takeover provisions. Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and the California General Corporation Law could discourage a third party from acquiring, or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company without approval of our board of directors. These provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Certain provisions allow the board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock. We are also subject to the provisions of Section 1203 of the California General Corporation Law which requires a fairness opinion to be provided to our shareholders in connection with their consideration of any proposed interested party reorganization transaction. 32 We have adopted a shareholder rights plan, commonly known as a poison pill. The provisions described above, our poison pill and provisions of the California General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. Increased costs associated with corporate governance compliance may significantly impact our results of operations. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations and Nasdaq Global Market rules, are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours in understanding and complying with these laws, regulations and standards. As a result of this uncertainty and other factors, devoting the necessary resources to comply with evolving corporate governance and public disclosure standards has resulted in and may in the future result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention to compliance activities. We also expect these developments to increase our legal compliance and financial reporting costs. In addition, these developments may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. Moreover, we may be unable to comply with these new rules and regulations on a timely basis. These developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, or qualified executive officers. We are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result. To the extent these costs are significant, our general and administrative expenses are likely to increase. If we sell shares of our common stock under our equity line of credit arrangement or in other future financings, existing common shareholders will experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may go down. We may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the current trading price of our common stock. As a result, our existing common shareholders will experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our common stock sold at such discount. For example, in December 2006, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Azimuth Opportunity Ltd., pursuant to which we may sell shares of common stock at a discount to the prevailing market price ranging from 3.775% to 6.375%, excluding an additional placement agent fee of 1.125% payable by us on the gross offering proceeds. In addition, as other capital raising opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred stock or common stock. If we issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock, our common shareholders will experience dilution and this dilution will be greater if we find it necessary to sell securities at a discount to prevailing market prices. If we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls, our stock price could suffer. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires companies to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. At the end of each fiscal year, we must perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, include in our annual report the results of the evaluation, and have our external auditors publicly attest to such evaluation. If material weaknesses were found in our internal controls in the future, if we fail to complete future evaluations on time, or if our external auditors cannot attest to our future evaluations, we could fail to meet our regulatory reporting requirements and be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. 33 Business interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business. Our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, human error, natural disasters, telecommunications failures, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay area, which has a history of seismic activity. We have not established a formal disaster recovery plan, and our back-up operations and our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that occur. A significant business interruption could result in losses or damages incurred by us and require us to cease or curtail our operations. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM
