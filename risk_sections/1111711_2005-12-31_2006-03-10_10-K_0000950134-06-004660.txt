ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSources Whiting merchant energy project is operating at a loss. NiSource owns and operates a merchant energy facility, Whiting Clean Energy, at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery. This facility uses natural gas to generate electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and to generate steam for industrial use by BPs refinery and as such, the profitability of this facility is dependant upon the market prices for electricity and natural gas, regional load dispatch patterns and the steam requirements of BPs refinery. It is anticipated that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. The after-tax loss for Whiting Clean Energy was approximately $21.5 million for 2005 and $29.6 million for 2004. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 12 Table of Contents
