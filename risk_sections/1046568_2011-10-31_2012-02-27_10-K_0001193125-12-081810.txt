Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate If our U.S. schools fail to comply with the extensive federal regulatory requirements for school operations in the educational services industry, we could incur financial penalties, restrictions on our operations, loss of federal and state financial aid funding for our students, or loss of our authorization to operate our U.S. schools. Federal regulatory requirements cover virtually all phases of the operations of our U.S. schools, including educational program offerings, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing and recruiting, financial operations, payment of refunds to students who withdraw, financial aid to students, acquisitions or openings of new institutions, additions of new educational programs, and changes in corporate structure and ownership. ED is our primary federal regulator pursuant to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). A significant portion of our U.S.-based students rely on student aid and loan programs under Title IV of the HEA (Title IV Programs) and we derive a substantial portion of our revenue and cash flows from Title IV Programs. For example, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, approximately 83% of our U.S.-based students who were in a program of study at any date during that year participated in student aid and loans under Title IV Programs, which resulted in cash receipts recorded by the Company of approximately $1.4 billion. All of our U.S. schools participate in Title IV Programs and are subject to extensive regulation by ED, various state agencies and accrediting commissions. To participate in Title IV Programs, a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies, be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by ED, and be certified by ED as an eligible institution. Most ED requirements are applied on an institutional basis, with an institution defined by ED as a main campus and any of its branch campuses or additional locations. Each institution is assigned an identification number known as an OPEID, or Office of Postsecondary Education Identification number, with each institutions branches and other locations assigned to the institutions OPEID. The regulations, standards and policies of our regulators change frequently and are subject to interpretation, particularly where they are crafted for traditional, academic term-based schools rather than our non-term academic delivery model. Changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations or standards could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, receipt of funds under Title IV Programs, or costs of doing business. We cannot predict with certainty how all of the requirements applied by our regulators will be interpreted or whether our schools will be able to comply with these requirements in the future. From time to time, we identify compliance deficiencies that we must address and, where appropriate, report such deficiencies to ED. Such reporting, even in regard to a minor or inadvertent compliance issue, could result in a more significant compliance review by ED or even a full recertification review, which may require the expenditure of substantial administrative time and resources to address. If ED concluded that these reported deficiencies reflect a lack of administrative capability, we or the particular institutions could be subject to additional sanctions or even lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs. Findings or allegations of noncompliance may subject us to qui tam lawsuits under the Federal False Claims Act, under which private plaintiffs seek to enforce remedies on behalf of the U.S. and, if successful, are entitled to recover their costs and to receive a portion of any amounts recovered by the U.S. in the lawsuit. Our U.S. schools could lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if the percentage of their revenues derived from Title IV Programs is too high, in which event we could not conduct our business as it is currently conducted. Any of our U.S. schools or OPEIDs may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs if, on modified cash basis accounting, the percentage of the cash receipts derived from Title IV Programs for two consecutive 35 Table of Contents fiscal years is greater than 90%. Under HEAs 90-10 Rule, an OPEID that derives more than 90% of its cash receipts from Title IV sources for a fiscal year will be placed on provisional participation status for its next two fiscal years. If the OPEID does not satisfy the 90-10 Rule for two consecutive fiscal years, it will lose its eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs for at least two fiscal years. If the OPEID violates the 90-10 Rule and becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs but continues to disburse Title IV Program funds, ED would require repayment of all Title IV Program funds received by it after the effective date of the loss of eligibility. Effective July 1, 2008, the annual unsubsidized Stafford loans available for undergraduate students was increased by $2,000. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) provided temporary 90-10 Rule relief from this increase by permitting institutions to count the additional $2,000 in Stafford loans dispersed before July 1, 2011 as revenue not derived from Title IV Programs. Several factors have adversely affected our schools ability to comply with the 90-10 Rule, including: the increase in Title IV Program aid availability, the expiration of the temporary relief in the HEOA with respect to unsubsidized Stafford loans as of July 1, 2012, lack of clarity regarding technical aspects of the calculation methodology under the 90-10 Rule, budget-related reductions in state grant and workforce training programs and other alternative funding sources that have historically helped schools in our industry to comply with the 90-10 Rule, plus the impact of EDs program integrity regulations discussed below. Additionally, we expect these factors to cause our schools 90-10 rates to worsen in each of fiscal 2011 and 2012 as compared to our historical rates. We have implemented in recent years various measures intended to reduce the percentage of our institutions cash basis revenue attributable to Title IV Program funds, including emphasizing employer-paid and other direct-pay education programs and counseling students to carefully evaluate the amount of necessary Title IV Program borrowing. Although we believe these measures will favorably impact our schools 90-10 Rule percentages, they have had only limited impact to date and there is no assurance that they will be adequate to prevent our schools 90-10 Rule percentages from exceeding 90% in the future. We have substantially no control over the amount of Title IV student loans and grants sought by or awarded to our students. Because of the increases in Title IV Program student loan limits and grants in recent years, we believe that many proprietary institutions are experiencing difficulty with respect to 90-10 Rule compliance. In our view, one potential unintended consequence of this pressure is higher tuition rates. This is because one of the more effective methods of reducing the 90-10 Rule percentage is to increase tuition prices above the applicable maximums for Title IV Program student loans and grants, requiring students to seek other sources of funding to pay eligible tuition and fees in order to reduce the percentage of revenue from Title IV sources. However, this consequence directly undermines EDs interest in promoting affordable postsecondary education. Although modification of the rule could limit this undesirable impact on tuition, there is no assurance that ED, or Congress, will address this problem by modifying the rule or will address it in a manner that timely and favorably impacts compliance by our institutions. We currently anticipate raising tuition at several of our campuses and programs that are under pressure to comply with the 90-10 Rule, which could adversely affect our enrollment, our cohort default rates and gainful employment metrics. We have tentatively calculated that, for our 2011 fiscal year, our institutions 90-10 Rule percentages ranged from approximately 61.1% to 94.5%. On February 14, 2012, we notified ED that we believe six of our OPEIDs had 90-10 Rule percentages above 90% for the 2011 fiscal year. These six institutions were our Sanford-Brown College institutions in Atlanta, GA, Boston, MA, Farmington, CT, Fenton, MO and McLean, VA as well as Missouri College, Brentwood, MO. The Sanford-Brown College institution in Atlanta, GA includes nine additional locations (Columbus, OH; Austin, TX; Houston, TX; Houston/North Loop, TX; and Middleburg Heights, OH; Sanford-Brown Institute, Ft. Lauderdale, FL; Landover, MD; New York, NY; and Trevose, PA) and the Sanford-Brown College institution in Fenton, MO includes one additional location (St. Peters, MO). These six OPEIDs contributed approximately $180 million of 2011 revenues and $12 million of operating income. 36 Table of Contents The six institutions that exceeded the 90-10 Rule limit in 2011 are now considered to be on provisional certification for two years and will be subject to possible additional ED sanctions. While ED has broad discretion to impose additional sanctions on these institutions, there is only limited precedent available to predict what those sanctions might be, particularly in the current regulatory environment. ED could specify a wide range of additional conditions as part of the provisional certification and the institutions continued participation in Title IV Programs. These conditions may include, among other things, restrictions on the total amount of Title IV Program funds that may be distributed to students attending the institutions; restrictions on programmatic and geographic expansion; requirements to obtain and post letters of credit; and additional reporting requirements to include additional interim financial or enrollment reporting. Should an institution become subject to such provisional certification at the time that its program participation agreement expires, the effect on the institutions recertification or its continued eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs pending recertification is uncertain. Any of our institutions that derive more than 90% of its revenue from Title IV Programs for two consecutive fiscal years will lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs for at least two fiscal years. In such event, such institutions operating and financial results would be materially adversely affected. Any necessary further efforts to reduce the 90-10 Rule percentage for our institutions, especially if the percentage exceeds 90% for a fiscal year, may involve taking measures that reduce our revenue, increase our operating expenses, or both, in each case perhaps significantly. If the 90-10 Rule is not changed to provide relief for proprietary institutions, we may be required to make structural changes to our business in order to remain in compliance, which changes may materially alter the manner in which we conduct our business and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, these required changes could make more difficult our ability to comply with other important regulatory requirements, such as the cohort default rate regulations. Our U.S. schools may lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs if their student loan cohort default rates are greater than the standards set by ED. To remain eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, our schools must maintain student loan cohort default rates below specified levels. ED calculates an educational institutions cohort default rate annually as a measure of administrative capability. Each cohort is the group of students who first enter into student loan repayment during a federal fiscal year (ending September 30). The currently applicable cohort default rate for each cohort is the percentage of the students in the cohort who default on their student loans prior to the end of the following federal fiscal year, which represents a two-year measuring period. The cohort default rates are published by ED approximately 12 months after the end of the measuring period. Thus, in September 2011, ED published the two-year cohort default rates for the 2009 cohort, which measured the percentage of students who first entered into repayment during the year ended September 30, 2009 and defaulted prior to September 30, 2010. As discussed below, the measurement period for the cohort default rate has increased to three years starting with the 2009 cohort, and the three-year cohort default rates for the 2009 cohort are expected to be issued by ED in draft form in the first quarter of 2012 and published by ED in September 2012. If an educational institutions two-year cohort default rate exceeds 10% for any one of the three preceding years, it must delay for 30 days the release of the first disbursement of U.S. federal student loan proceeds to first time borrowers enrolled in the first year of an undergraduate program. As a matter of regular practice, all of our institutions have implemented a 30-day delay for such disbursements. If an institutions two-year cohort default rate exceeds 25% for three consecutive years or 40% for any given year, it will become ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs and, as a result, its students would not be eligible for federal student financial aid. See Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a table listing each of our educational institutions two-year cohort default rates. We believe the cohort default rates of our schools have been increasing over the past several years due to the challenging economic climate, and changes in the manner in which student loans are serviced. The July 2010 elimination of the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), under which private lenders originated and serviced federally guaranteed student loans, and the resulting migration of all federal 37 Table of Contents student loans to the Federal Direct Loan Program under which the federal government lends directly to students, could adversely impact loan repayment rates and our schools cohort default rates, if the federal government is less effective in promoting timely repayment of federal student loans than the private lenders were under the FFELP. If our student loan default rates approach applicable limits, we may be required to increase our efforts and resources dedicated to improving these default rates. In addition, because there is a lag between the funding of a student loan and a default thereunder, many of the borrowers who are in default or at risk of default are former students with whom we may have only limited contact. Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively improve our default rates or improve them in a timely manner to meet the requirements for continued participation in Title IV Program funding if we experience a substantial increase in our student loan default rates. The cohort default rate requirements were modified by the HEOA enacted in August 2008 to increase by one year the measuring period for each cohort. Starting in September 2012, ED will publish the official three-year cohort default rates in addition to the two-year rates. Beginning with the 2009 cohort, if an institutions three-year cohort default rate exceeds 30% for any given year, it must establish a default prevention task force and develop a default prevention plan with measurable objectives for improving the cohort default rate. We believe that our current repayment management efforts meet these requirements. If an institutions three-year cohort default rates for the 2009 and 2010 cohorts exceed 30%, the institution may be subject to provisional certification imposing various additional requirements for participation in Title IV Programs. Beginning with the three-year cohort default rate for the 2011 cohort to be published in September 2014, only the three-year rates will be applied for purposes of measuring compliance with the requirements and imposing sanctions, as follows:  Annual test. If the three-year cohort default rate for any given year exceeds 40%, the institution will cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV Programs; and  Three consecutive years test. If the institutions three-year cohort default rate exceeds 30% (an increase from the current 25% threshold applicable to the two-year cohort default rates) for three consecutive years, beginning with the 2009 cohort, the institution will cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV Programs. The consequences applicable to two-year cohort default rates will continue to apply through calendar year 2013 for the fiscal 2011 cohort. In December 2009, ED released unofficial trial calculations of schools cohort default rates based on the new three-year repayment and default period mandated by a change in the Higher Education Act. The trial rates were for the 2005, 2006 and 2007 cohorts, meaning for students who entered repayment on their loans during the three fiscal year periods between October 2004 and September 2007. In issuing these trial rates, ED reminded institutions that the rates were unofficial, that they were being provided for information only, and that no sanctions would result from these rates. Further, because these were unofficial rates with no consequences, ED did not allow schools to challenge or appeal the rates and the data underlying them. ED also stated that the rates did not reflect certain adjustments that ED would normally have made if it were issuing official cohort default rates (for example, fewer than 30 borrowers in a cohort, low participation, mergers, recalculations due to appeals, and other adjustments). For the 2006 and 2007 cohorts, none of our institutions were above the regulatory thresholds that will take effect in 2014. In February 2011, ED released the trial calculations of schools three year cohort default rates for the 2008 cohort. Following criticism by the higher education community of EDs calculations of the trial rates, ED withdrew them, recalculated them and re-issued revised trial rates in April 2011 noting that the trial rates that had been previously released were incorrectly inflated. In doing so, ED again advised schools that these were unofficial, trial rates with no sanctions tied to them and no ability to appeal or challenge them. ED does not ever plan to allow schools to challenge the calculation of their individual trial three-year cohort default rates for 2008 cohort, or to issue official three-year cohort default rates for that year. 38 Table of Contents ED is expected to issue more authoritative three-year cohort default rates for students who entered repayment on their loans between October 2008 and September 2009, in the first quarter of 2012, but even those will be draft rates, which schools will be able to challenge in certain ways, and will not be official cohort default rates, which are expected to be issued sometime in the fall of 2012. A listing of the most recent three years of published trial three-year cohort default rates for each of our main and additional (branch) campus locations for regulatory purposes is provided in the following table: School, Main Campus Location (Additional locations as defined by accreditors are in parentheses) Cohort Default Rate (3 year trial rate) 2008 2007 2006 American InterContinental University Schaumburg, IL (Online) (Atlanta, GA; Weston, FL; Houston, TX; London, England) 21.5 % 19.7 % 16.2 % Briarcliffe College Bethpage, NY (Patchogue, NY) 20.7 % 17.1 % 14.7 % Brooks Institute Santa Barbara, CA 12.2 % 6.7 % 4.2 % Brown College Mendota Heights, MN (Brooklyn Center, MN) 12.8 % 14.9 % 14.1 % California Culinary Academy San Francisco, CA 15.4 % 9.4 % 9.4 % Colorado Technical University Colorado Springs, CO (Denver, CO; North Kansas City, MO; Sioux Falls, SD; Online) 23.1 % 22.3 % 23.8 % Harrington College of Design Chicago, IL 12.0 % 7.7 % 5.3 % International Academy of Design & Technology Chicago, IL (Troy, MI; Schaumburg, IL; Nashville, TN; Collins College; Phoenix, AZ) 22.6 % 15.7 % 17.0 % Tampa, FL (Orlando, FL; Henderson, NV; Sacramento, CA; San Antonio, TX; Seattle, WA; Online; Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts Orlando, FL; Sanford-Brown College, Portland, OR) 20.2 % 17.2 % 15.2 % Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts Austin, TX (Dallas, TX; Sacramento, CA; Seattle, WA; and St. Peters, MO; Sanford-Brown College, Collinsville, IL and Hazelwood, MO) 22.0 % 13.3 % 19.8 % Pasadena, CA (Hollywood, CA; Sanford-Brown College, Dearborn, MI; Grand Rapids, MI; Hillside, IL; Indianapolis, IN; Phoenix, AZ; Tinley Park, IL; and Skokie, IL; Sanford-Brown Institute, Orlando, FL) 14.9 % 8.4 % 11.1 % Portland, OR (Tucker, GA; Mendota Heights, MN) 19.8 % 12.5 % 14.6 % Scottsdale, AZ (includes Online) (Las Vegas, NV) 20.0 % 17.0 % 16.6 % Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts in Chicago Chicago, IL 18.6 % 12.1 % 15.3 % Le Cordon Bleu Institute of Culinary Arts Pittsburgh, PA (Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts, Inc., a private two year college (Cambridge, MA); Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts, Miramar, FL) 19.7 % 15.6 % 15.7 % 39 Table of Contents School, Main Campus Location (Additional locations as defined by accreditors are in parentheses) Cohort Default Rate (3 year trial rate) 2008 2007 2006 Missouri College Brentwood, MO 20.0 % 16.4 % 16.9 % Sanford-Brown College Atlanta, GA (Columbus, OH; Houston, TX; Houston/North Loop, TX; and Middleburg Heights, OH; Sanford-Brown Institute, Austin, TX; Ft.

To participate in Title IV Programs, our schools must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by ED, or post a letter of credit in favor of ED and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV Programs. Pursuant to the Title IV Program regulations, each eligible higher education institution must satisfy a measure of financial responsibility that is based on a weighted average of three annual tests which assess the financial condition of the institution. The three tests measure primary reserve, equity and net income ratios. The Primary Reserve Ratio is a measure of an institutions financial viability and liquidity. The Equity Ratio is a measure of an institutions capital resources and its ability to borrow. The Net Income Ratio is a measure of an institutions profitability. These tests provide three individual scores that are converted into a single composite score. The maximum composite score is 3.0. If the institution achieves a composite score of at least 1.5, it is considered financially responsible. A composite score from 1.0 to 1.4 is considered to be in the zone of financially responsibility, and the institution may continue to participate as a financially responsible institution for up to three years, subject to additional monitoring and other consequences. If an institution does not achieve a composite score of at least 1.0, it may demonstrate its financial responsibility or satisfy an alternative by posting a letter of credit in favor of ED in an amount equal to at least 50% of Title IV Program funds received by the institution in its prior fiscal year or posting a letter of credit in an amount equal it at least 10% of Title IV Program funds received by the institution in its prior fiscal year and accepting provisional certification and other conditions. These conditions could include being transferred from the advance system of payment of Title IV Program funds to cash monitoring status or to the reimbursement system of payment, under which the institution must disburse its own funds to students and document the students eligibility for Title IV Program funds before receiving such funds from ED, which could result in a significant delay in receiving such funds. 40 Table of Contents ED applies its quantitative financial responsibility tests annually based on the schools audited financial statements and may apply the tests if a school undergoes a change in control or under other circumstances. ED also may apply the tests to us, as the parent company of our schools, and to other related entities. Recent profitability declines at several of our institutions have placed downward pressure on our financial responsibility composite scores; however, we believe all of our institutions, as well as the Company, on a consolidated basis, have continued to maintain a composite score above 1.50 for fiscal 2011. Limits may be placed on our U.S. schools participation in Title IV Programs if they fail to satisfy EDs administrative capability standards that cover staffing, procedures for disbursing and safeguarding Title IV Program funds, reporting and other procedural matters. If a school fails to meet these criteria, ED may require repayment of previously disbursed Title IV Program funds, place the school on provisional certification status, or transfer the school from EDs advance funding arrangement to another funding arrangement, impose fines, or limit or terminate the schools participation in Title IV Programs. If our schools fail to maintain administrative capability or financial responsibility, as defined by ED, they could lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs or have that eligibility adversely conditioned, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Limitations on, or termination of, participation in Title IV Programs as a result of the failure to demonstrate administrative capability or financial responsibility would limit students access to Title IV Program funds, which would significantly reduce the enrollments and revenues of our schools eligible to participate in Title IV Programs and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If any of our programs fail to qualify as programs leading to gainful employment in a recognized occupation under ED regulations, students in those programs would be unable to obtain Title IV Program funds to finance their education and, if student demand for those programs declined significantly, we may determine to cease offering those programs. Under the HEA, proprietary schools are eligible to participate in Title IV Programs only in respect of educational programs that lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation, which include all of the educational programs offered by all of our schools. Beginning July 1, 2011, proprietary institutions of higher education and public or not-for profit institutions offering postsecondary non-degree programs must disclose to prospective students the following information for each Title IV eligible program: the occupations that a program prepares students to enter, along with links to occupational profiles on O*NET (http://www.onetonline.org/); the estimated cost for students to complete the program, including tuition, fees, books, and other related costs; on-time graduation rates as defined by regulation; the median loan debt of program completers; and placement rates for the program, if a placement rate is required by an institutional or programmatic accreditor or a state regulator. Beginning in November 2011, institutions must annually submit information to ED about all students who were enrolled in or completed one of the institutions Title-IV eligible programs which lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation in the preceding years. The information to be reported to ED includes: identifying information for each student and the institution; the name and Classification of Instructional Program (CIP) code of that program; the amount of debt owed by the student under private loans and/or institutional finance plans, matriculation information if the student matriculated to a higher credentialed program; and end of year enrollment information. Additionally, beginning July 1, 2011 the final regulations require institutions to notify ED at least 90 days before the commencement of new educational programs leading to gainful employment in recognized occupations where the institution is seeking to distribute Title IV Program funds to enrollees of the new program. This notification must include new types of information not previously required in such applications, such as the following: a statement regarding the institutions demonstrated financial responsibility and administrative capability of the institution; a statement outlining how the institution determined the demand for the program; a wage analysis; an institutional program review and approval process. Unless ED, in its discretion, requires approval for new programs, a school is not required to obtain formal ED approval if the notification is submitted on a timely basis. If such approval is required, an alert notice will be sent to the school at least 30 days before the first day of class with a request for additional information. If a new 41 Table of Contents program is denied, ED will explain how the program failed and provide an opportunity for the school to respond or request reconsideration. ED promulgated final regulations on June 13, 2011, imposing additional Title IV Program eligibility requirements on educational programs leading to gainful employment. The final regulations are conceptually similar to proposed regulations proposed by ED in 2010, but relax certain requirements and extend the time period for compliance. The final gainful employment rules definefor the first timethe standards that will be used to measure whether an educational program prepare students for gainful employment as that term is used in the HEA. The rules establish three annual standards related to student loan borrowing by which gainful employment will be measured, effective July 1, 2012: 1. Annual loan repayment rate, which assesses whether the federal student loan debt incurred by the applicable cohort of borrowers to attend the program is being repaid at a rate that implies the cohort received an education that enabled them to find gainful employment and successfully repay their loans. The most common calculation of the annual loan repayment rate for an academic program is the percentage of total student loans incurred by a cohort of borrowers to fund the costs of a program that are in satisfactory repayment status up to two to four years after the cohort of borrowers entered repayment. Generally, an individual loan is considered in satisfactory repayment status if the borrower has made payments that reduce the outstanding principal on the loan as of the first day of the federal fiscal year. Rates are calculated on a federal fiscal year basis. The repayment rate must be at least 35%. Institutions will be able to challenge the repayment rate data using a process somewhat similar to one used to challenge cohort default rates. 2. Discretionary income threshold, which determines whether the annual repayment required on total student loan debt of students who completed an academic program is reasonable compared to their discretionary income. For purposes of determining the annual loan repayment amount for a given student, ED will use the lesser of the amount of student loan debt incurred by the student or the total amount of tuition and fees the institution charged the student for enrollment in all programs at the institution, if tuition and fee information is provided by the institution. The median annual loan payment amount for the applicable cohort of students (calculated as described below) may not be greater than 30% of the greater of their average or median discretionary income. Discretionary income is the annual earnings of a program completer minus 150% of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) poverty guideline for a single person. The debt-to-discretionary income ratio examines students in their third or fourth year after graduation, calculated on a federal fiscal year basis. 3. Actual earnings threshold, which determines whether the annual repayment required on total student loan debt of students who completed an academic program is reasonable when compared to their actual annual earnings. For purposes of determining the annual loan repayment for a given student, ED will use the lesser of the amount of student loan debt incurred by the student or the total amount of tuition and fees the institution charged the student for enrollment in all programs at the institution, if tuition and fee information is provided by the institution. The median annual loan payment amount for the applicable cohort of students (calculated as described below) may not be greater than 12% of the greater of their average or median annual earnings. The debt-to-actual earnings ratio examines students in their third or fourth year after graduation, calculated on a federal fiscal year basis. An academic program that passes any one standard for a given year is considered to be preparing students for gainful employment. If an academic program fails all three metrics for a given year, the institution will have to provide additional disclosures or warnings, but will also have the opportunity to improve the performance of that program. After one failure, the institution must disclose to students and prospective students the amount by which the program missed the minimal acceptable performance and the programs plan for improvement. After two failures within three years, the institution must inform students in the failing program that their debts may be unaffordable, that the program may lose eligibility, and what transfer options exist. After three failures within four years, the academic program loses eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs for at least three years, although the program could be continued without Title IV Program funding. If a particular program ceased to be eligible for Title IV Program funding, in most cases it would not be practical to continue offering that program under our current business model. 42 Table of Contents The earliest a program could lose eligibility under the gainful employment rule will be 2015, based on the 2012, 2013 and 2014 metrics. Because EDs gainful employment rules will be implemented over several years and are based at least in part on data that is unavailable to us, it is not possible at this time to determine with any degree of certainty whether it will cause any of our programs to become ineligible for Title IV Program funding. ED will limit the number of programs that will lose eligibility based on failing all of the debt measures for three years out of four to no more than 5% of programs (weighted by enrollment) at proprietary institutions. It is possible that certain of our programs, primarily within our Culinary Arts and Art & Design programs, may be unable to maintain eligibility to enroll students receiving Title IV Program funds or have restrictions placed upon program offerings as a result of not meeting prescribed metrics. Such loss of or restrictions to program eligibility may result in us determining to terminate or modify the affected programs under our current business model, and also result in a realignment of the types of educational programs we offer in order to comply with the new rules. Although the final rules regarding gainful employment metrics provide opportunities to address program deficiencies before the loss of Title IV Program eligibility, the continuing eligibility of our educational programs for Title IV Program funding is at risk due to factors beyond our control, such as changes in the actual or deemed income level of our graduates, changes in student borrowing levels, increases in interest rates, changes in the federal poverty income level relevant for calculating discretionary income, changes in the percentage of our former students who are current in repayment of their student loans, and other factors. In addition, the disclosure requirements to students following a failure to meet the standards may adversely impact enrollment in that program and may adversely impact the reputation of our educational institutions. The exposure to these external factors may reduce our ability to offer or continue certain types of programs for which there is market demand, thus impacting our ability to maintain or grow our business. The requirements for reporting information relating to our programs to ED and to our students will substantially increase our administrative burdens, particularly during the implementation phase. These reporting and the other procedural changes in the new rules could impact student enrollment, persistence and retention in ways that we cannot now predict. For example, if our reported program information compares unfavorably with other reporting educational institutions, it could adversely impact demand for our programs. The U.S. Congress commenced hearings and other examinations of the proprietary educational sector that have resulted in adverse publicity for the proprietary postsecondary education sector and could result in legislation, ED rulemaking, restrictions on Title IV Program participation by proprietary schools, litigation or other actions that may materially and adversely affect our business. Both the U.S. House of Representatives Education and Labor Committee and the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee (HELP Committee) commenced a series of hearings into the proprietary postsecondary education sector in June 2010, including accreditation matters, student debt, student recruiting, student success and outcomes, and other matters, which hearings are ongoing. The U.S. Senate also released a report, Emerging Risk?: An Overview of Growth, Spending, Student Debt and Unanswered Questions in For-Profit Higher Education. The Chairmen of each of these education committees, together with other members of Congress, requested the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a review and prepare a report with recommendations regarding various aspects of the proprietary sector, including recruitment practices, educational quality, student outcomes, the sufficiency of integrity safeguards against waste, fraud and abuse in federal student aid programs and the degree to which proprietary institutions revenue is composed of Title IV Program and other federal funding sources. In addition, in August 2010, the HELP Committee requested information from 30 companies operating proprietary schools, including us and other proprietary publicly traded companies providing postsecondary education services. We provided documents and information in response to the HELP Committees request. In September 2010, the HELP Committee released a second report, The Return on the Federal Investment in For-Profit Education: Debt Without a Diploma. Senator Harkin has held subsequent hearings and roundtable discussions, most recently on July 21, 2011. On September 22, 2011, Senator 43 Table of Contents Tom Carper, the Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information, Federal Services and International Security, held a hearing on Improving Educational Outcomes for Our Military and Veterans that covered the quality of education and treatment of educational benefits for military personnel for purposes of the 90-10 Rule. These hearings, the requested GAO review and the HELP Committees information request could lead to adverse legislation, additional new ED regulatory requirements, negative media coverage, federal or other investigations of the proprietary postsecondary education industry, or third-party litigation related to information arising from these activities. We cannot predict the extent to which, or whether, these hearings and examinations will result in further legislation or rulemaking affecting our participation in Title IV Programs, or result in other events that could affect aspects of our business. If any laws or regulations are adopted that limit or terminate our participation in Title IV Programs or the amount of student financial aid for which our students are eligible, our business could be adversely and materially impacted. The confluence of the increasing scrutiny in Congress of the proprietary education sector and the unprecedented budget deficits increases the likelihood of new legislation that will adversely impact our business. For example, Congress could extend the elimination of the in-school interest subsidy to undergraduate students or to undergraduate students in proprietary institutions, reduce the maximum amount of or change the eligibility standards for student loans and/or Pell Grants or make other material changes in Title IV Programs driven by policy considerations, economic considerations or both. Any action by Congress that significantly reduces Title IV Program funding, whether through across-the-board funding reductions, sequestration or otherwise, or materially impacts the eligibility of our institutions or students to participate in Title IV Programs would have a material adverse effect on our enrollment, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Congressional action could also require us to modify our practices in ways that could increase our administrative costs and reduce our operating income, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If Congress significantly reduced the amount of available Title IV Program funding, we would attempt to arrange for alternative sources of financial aid for our students, which may include lending funds directly to our students, but private sources would not be able to provide as much funding to our students on as favorable terms as is currently provided by Title IV. In addition, private organizations could require us to guarantee all or part of this assistance and we might incur other additional costs. For these reasons, private, alternative sources of student financial aid would only partly offset, if at all, the impact on our business of reduced Title IV Program funding. We are in the process of consolidating most of our nationally accredited institutions with separate OPEIDs into a single institution and single OPEID. The consolidation process itself is complicated and has risks as does our continued operation of so many campuses as a single institution for Title IV Program compliance purposes. Since June 2011, we have been working with ED, ACICS and numerous state regulators to consolidate as many as 19 separate institutions or OPEIDs into a single institution or OPEID. The consolidation will require internal reprogramming of our systems and Title IV Program aid processing realignment that could adversely impact operations. The consolidation will create certain risks. Because the Title IV Program compliance of so many of our campuses will be evaluated as a single institution, compliance issues at one campus could result in a sanction or other action that negatively impacts the whole group (for instance, a problem at a single campus could lead ED to limit the ability of all of the campuses within the consolidated OPEID to add new programs or take such actions against the consolidated group of campuses). Another result of this consolidation will be the calculation of a single student loan cohort default rate and a single rate under the 90-10 Rule for all of the campuses within the consolidated institution. This consolidation will not alleviate the risks we face in continuing to comply with the 90-10 Rule. We have received all the requisite approvals and acknowledgements to proceed with the consolidation from our state regulators and institutional accreditor and are awaiting approval of our application from ED. On 44 Table of Contents December 27, 2011 we received a letter from ED requesting all of our regulatory correspondence with all state agencies and accreditors dating back to June 30, 2010. ED noted in its request that it would defer any final approval of our application for the consolidation pending its review of the materials provided. Because the consolidation did not occur prior to the end of fiscal 2011, we will again prepare separate Title IV Program compliance audits and report separate compliance metrics for each of our affected OPEIDs for fiscal 2011. As previously noted, we have reported to ED that we believe six of our OPEIDs that are part of the outstanding consolidation application did not satisfy the 90-10 Rule in 2011. It is unclear what impact this will have on EDs review of our application or the terms of any approval of the consolidated group of schools. It is also unclear what the impact would be on our consolidation application or the terms of any approval on the consolidated group of schools if one or more of the OPEIDs we are consolidating were to fail to meet other regulatory requirements or have a material compliance issue arise in its audit for fiscal 2011. We would expect ED to review any such situation based on the particular facts and circumstances, and there could be an adverse impact on the consolidated institution or EDs decision to approve the application. ED rulemaking could materially and adversely affect our operations, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In October 2010, ED issued new regulations pertaining to certain aspects of the administration of the Title IV Programs, including, but not limited to state authorization; gainful employment; compensation rules for persons and entities engaged in certain aspects of recruiting, admissions and student financial aid; determination of attendance; and definition of credit hours. With minor exceptions, these regulations became effective July 1, 2011. These new regulations could have a significant impact on our business. Among the most significant regulatory changes that we have identified for our business are:  the elimination of safe harbors that had allowed, under limited and prescribed circumstances, payment of certain types of compensation to employees (including higher level employees) and third parties involved in student recruiting, admissions or financial aid activities;  imposition of extensive record-keeping and disclosure requirements regarding the employment of graduates, as part of the gainful employment regulations described above;  defining a credit hour for purposes of determining program eligibility for Title IV student financial aid;  establishing more stringent state approval requirements that may require or encourage states to modify existing state approval and licensing processes;  defining academic attendance to specifically exclude logging into an online class without active participation and otherwise generally limiting the types of activities that qualify as academic attendance in an online environment;  requiring an institution that offers distance learning programs to secure the approval of each state where it enrolls students to the extent any such state requires such approval and provide evidence of such approval to ED upon request; and  changing the definition of substantial misrepresentation to include, among other things, erroneous statements, including erroneous statements made by certain third-party vendors under contract to an institution, which may increase institutional liability and subject institutions to sanctions for statements containing inadvertent errors, and expose institutions to costly third-party litigation. These rules have required us to change certain of our business practices, incur costs of compliance and of developing and implementing changes in operations, and may affect student recruitment and enrollment, result in changes in or elimination of certain educational programs and have other significant or material effects on our business. 45 Table of Contents Among other things, these rules will impact or have impacted our compensation programs for persons (including higher level employees) and entities involved in student recruitment, admissions and financial aid, including third-party lead generators and Internet marketing vendors, which may adversely affect:  our ability to compensate our employees involved in recruitment, admissions and student financial aid based on relative merit,  our recruitment and retention of such employees,  the motivation and effectiveness of such employees,  our ability to provide certain forms of compensation to management, impacting recruitment and retention,  our compensation practices for third-party Internet marketing and lead-generation service providers,  the quality of leads generated by these third-party service providers and increased cost for leads,  our marketing costs and marketing strategies, by decreasing marketing efficiency to the extent we conduct direct marketing rather than utilize third-party lead aggregators, and through increasing costs of recruiting and enrolling prospective students, and  our revenues, if we are unable to maintain or increase the rate of student enrollments. We have terminated certain compensation payments to our affected employees and have implemented changes in contractual or other arrangements with third parties to change payment structures formerly allowed under ED rules. Our schools offering distance learning are completing additional applications for licensures or confirming exemptions for their distance learning programs. At this time, the impact and potential costs of federal and state distance learning regulations on our schools is still uncertain but will increase our costs of regulatory compliance, will likely delay the introduction of new programs and as a result of these new regulations may have other material adverse effects on our operations, revenues, results of operations and cash flows. The requirements for reporting gainful employment-related information relating to our programs to ED and to our students will substantially increase our administrative burdens, particularly during the implementation phase. This reporting and the other procedural changes in the new rules could impact student enrollment, persistence and retention in ways that we cannot now predict. For example, if our reported program information compares unfavorably with other reporting educational institutions, it could adversely impact demand for our programs. In addition, the ability of our U.S. schools or OPEIDs to continue to meet the 90-10 Rule and to therefore qualify to participate in Title IV Program funding, may be negatively impacted by changes we make to comply with final gainful employment regulations, by the expiration of temporary relief related to the classification of certain Stafford loan revenues, by changes in the allowable amounts of Pell Grants made annually to students, new regulations or interpretations by ED regarding the types of funding sources classified as non-Title IV Program funds, other ED regulations or interpretations affecting technical aspects of the calculation methodology under the Rule, or other factors that we cannot predict or control. Failure to meet the 90-10 Rule by our schools or OPEIDs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation, cash flows and value of our common stock. In addition to the rules, ED routinely issues Dear Colleague Letters to provide sub-regulatory guidance on certain areas of final regulations. The guidance is provided to assist institutions with understanding the regulations in these areas, and does not make any changes to the regulations. ED has issued numerous Dear Colleague Letters to provide further information on other provisions of the program integrity regulations and created a website dedicated to gainful employment information found at http://ifap.ed.gov/GainfulEmploymentInfo/index.html. 46 Table of Contents On September 27, 2011, ED published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend regulations and to streamline the application and approval process for new programs, as required by the gainful employment rules. The public comment period ended on November 14, 2011 and ED is reviewing and considering responses to the NPRM before publishing final regulations that would be effective by July 2013. In April 2011, ED announced its intention to establish one or more negotiated rulemaking committees to propose additional new regulations under HEA. ED held three public hearings in May 2011, at which interested parties suggested issues that should be considered for action by the negotiating committees. In October 2011, ED announced that it would be establishing two new negotiated rulemaking committees: one to address student loan issues and the other to address issues related to teacher preparation and the TEACH grant program. In January 2012, each of the committees held its first working meeting. If the work of either or both of these committees results in proposals for specific new regulations, ED will have to finalize and publish the new regulations by November 1, 2012, in order for the new regulations to take effect July 1, 2013. The new rules imposed by ED require a large number of reporting and operational changes. We believe we have substantially complied with the new reporting and disclosure requirements that were effective July 1, 2011, and we expect to be in substantial compliance with the remaining requirements by the respective effective dates. However, because of the scale and complexity of our educational programs, we may be unable to fully develop, test and implement all of the necessary modifications to our information management systems and administrative processes by the required dates. We may be subject to administrative or other sanctions if we are unable to comply with these reporting and disclosure requirements on a timely basis. In addition, these changes, individually or in combination, may impact our student enrollment, persistence and retention in ways that we cannot now predict. We cannot predict with certainty the combined impact of the program integrity regulations on our operations, nor can we predict the effect of other legislative or regulatory changes by federal, state or other agencies regulating our education programs or other aspects of our operations, how any resulting regulations will be interpreted or whether we and our schools will be able to comply with these requirements in the future. Any such actions by other bodies that affect our programs and operations could have a material adverse effect on our student population, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Government agencies, regulatory agencies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews and audits, bring claims or initiate litigation against us based on alleged noncompliance with, or violations of, the extensive regulatory requirements applicable to us, and could require us to refund amounts received under Title IV Programs or state financial aid programs or impose monetary damages, sanctions or impose significant limitations on our operations. We may be required to expend significant resources to defend against those claims. Government and regulatory agencies and third parties may bring actions against us based on alleged violations of the extensive regulatory requirements applicable to us, alleged misrepresentations and other claims. While our compliance programs are similarly extensive and emphasize individual and organizational responsibility for compliance, as well as employing technological compliance controls, it is possible for one or more of our employees to engage in non-compliant behavior or make statements that violate some aspect of the extensive regulations governing our schools and business. Any alleged or other purported misrepresentations or actual infractions could result in (a) imposition of monetary fines or penalties, (b) repayment of funds received under Title IV Programs or state financial aid programs, (c) restrictions on or termination of our U.S. schools eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs or state financial aid programs, (d) limits on, or result in termination of, our U.S. schools operations or ability to grant degrees, diplomas and certificates, (e) restriction or revocation of our U.S. schools accreditations, (f) limitations on our ability to open new schools or offer new programs, (g) costly investigations or adversarial proceedings, or (h) civil or criminal penalties being levied against us or our schools. Any one of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows or result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. We may also be required to expend significant resources defending against such claims. 47 Table of Contents Due to their participation in Title IV Programs, our schools and universities are subject to periodic program reviews and audits by ED for the purpose of evaluating an institutions compliance with Title IV Program requirements, identifying any liabilities to ED or students caused by errors in compliance, and improving future institutional capabilities. As previously disclosed, ED conducted a program review of AIU in November 2009. On July 14, 2010, AIU received a copy of EDs Program Review Report, which is a preliminary report of EDs findings from its program review. The Program Review Report identified six findings, two of which were deemed to be systemic findings by EDs program review team. These two findings relate to AIUs policy for determining student attendance in online courses for purposes of determining such students enrollment status, withdrawal dates and associated timing respecting the return of unearned Title IV Program funds. Based on information available to us, we cannot determine a range of loss for these findings or assess whether an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The remaining findings were isolated and generally relate to processing errors. We believe the amounts involved in these four findings are immaterial. AIU submitted its response to EDs Program Review Report on November 29, 2010 and is awaiting EDs issuance of a Final Program Review Determination letter that will specify any required corrective action and amounts owed to ED, if any. In addition, as previously disclosed, EDs Office of Inspector General audit services division commenced a compliance audit of CTU in June 2010, covering the period July 5, 2009 to May 16, 2010, to determine whether CTU had policies and procedures to ensure that CTU administered Title IV Program and other federal program funds in accordance with applicable federal law and regulation. On January 13, 2012, the OIG issued a draft report identifying three findings, two of potential material non-compliance. Specifically, documentation of attendance of students enrolled in online programs and calculation of returns of Title IV Program funds arising from student withdrawals without official notice to the institution. CTU is in the process of preparing a written response to the OIG, contesting these findings which is due on February 29, 2012. After CTU submits its response to the draft OIG report, the OIG report, along with CTUs response, will be forwarded to EDs Office of Federal Student Aid which will make an independent assessment of what further action, if any, is warranted. Based on information available to us, we cannot determine a range of loss for these findings or assess whether an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In August 2011, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) conducted a compliance survey at the Colorado Springs campus of CTU. While the VA has not yet issued a report respecting its findings, at an exit conference held on August 9, 2011, the VA informed CTU that it had identified certain students for whom it believed CTU had incorrectly certified the monthly housing allowance (MHA) provided pursuant to the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act (Post-9/11 GI Bill). While CTU believes the position of the VA Regional Office is based on a difference in interpretation of applicable provisions of law, CTU is working with the VA to ensure that students entitled to benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill will not be adversely impacted or held responsible for any adjustments that are made respecting the MHA. Based on information currently available to us, we estimate potential reimbursements by CTU of approximately $5.0 million. Accordingly, we have accrued $5.0 million as an estimate for the reasonably possible settlement of this matter. At this time, the survey of the Colorado Springs campus is not concluded. The VA is also conducting compliance survey reviews at other CTU ground campuses, including Denver, Kansas City and Sioux Falls, and is expected to conduct a compliance survey review of CTU Online starting in March 2012. The VA has not conducted exit conferences or issued reports on these additional compliance surveys. ED recently moved all of our institutions from what is called the Advance Method of Payment to what is called Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 status. Although our existing practices substantially conform to the requirements of this more restrictive method of drawing down students Title IV Program funds, ED may find violations of the HEA or ED regulations that would cause ED to transfer our schools to Heightened Cash Monitoring 2 which would substantially delay our receipt of Title IV Program funds and impose additional documentation and waiting period requirements. If our schools fail to meet the substantial regulatory requirements they are subject to, they could be required to refund amounts received under Title IV Programs or state financial aid programs or subject to monetary 48 Table of Contents damages, sanctions or significant limitations on our operations which could significantly reduce the enrollments and revenues of our schools eligible to participate in Title IV programs and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may be required to expend significant resources to defend against those claims Any failure to comply with state and regulatory requirements, or new state legislative or regulatory initiatives affecting our schools, could have a material adverse effect on our student population, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our schools are subject to extensive state-level regulation and oversight by state licensing agencies, whose approval or exemption is necessary to allow an institution to operate and grant degrees or diplomas. State laws vary from state to state, but generally establish standards for faculty qualifications, the location and nature of facilities, financial policies, new programs and student instruction, administrative staff, marketing and recruitment and other operational and administrative procedures. Any failure of one of our U.S. schools to maintain state authorization would result in that school being unable to offer educational programs and students attending the campus being ineligible for Title IV Programs. State legislatures often consider legislation affecting regulation of postsecondary educational institutions. Enactment of this legislation and ensuing regulations, or changes in interpretation of existing regulations, may impose substantial costs on our schools and require them to modify their operations in order to comply with the new regulations. Additionally, the October 29, 2010 regulations impose requirements on states with regard to their licensure and authorization of postsecondary institutions such as those operated by us. States that do not currently have an approval framework that meets ED requirements will need to modify their authorization and licensure requirements in order for them to maintain their eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs. State regulatory changes and approval and exemption processes can be lengthy and may be made more difficult and time consuming as a result of state budget challenges, increased pressures on states caused by new federal regulations and staffing shortages. These new requirements went into effect July 1, 2011 and have required our schools to act quickly to a changing state regulatory landscape as they adapt to the new guidelines imposed by ED. The October 29, 2010 regulations also require that an institution offering distance learning or online programs secure the approval of those states which require such approval and provide evidence of such approval to ED upon request. On July 12, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia struck down those portions of the October 29, 2010 regulations requiring proof of state approval for online education programs. That holding has been appealed by ED. If the lower court ruling is upheld, ED may elect to re-introduce this rule. These regulations, among other things, may require our schools offering distance education to obtain state approvals or registrations or exemptions from such requirements from additional states which currently or in the future may elect to regulate institutions that enroll the relevant states residents in online programs and courses. State regulatory requirements for online education are inconsistent between states, change frequently and, in some instances, are not clear, and the interpretation of such regulations is generally left to the discretion of state employees or agents. In response to the new ED rules, states that do not presently regulate delivery of online courses and programs have enacted legislation or issue regulations or interpret existing regulations to specifically address online educational programs, such as those offered by our schools, may enact or issue further regulations impacting the availability of exemptions from licensure in certain states, or otherwise affect our schools operations. Our schools offering distance learning have submitted or expect to submit additional applications for licensures or exemptions for their distance learning programs. Many other educational institutions have or will be submitting similar applications and we cannot anticipate how quickly the state agencies, some of which we believe are taxed by resource shortages, will be able to respond to the applications. While EDs final regulations contain provisions for obtaining annual waivers that may allow schools to operate without specific state regulatory approvals through July 1, 2013, if one of our schools offering distance learning does not have the appropriate state approvals for its online programs or is not able to customize its policies, procedures or programs to meet select state regulatory requirements or is unable to obtain a waiver, it may not be able to continue to offer distance education to students in those states unless it obtains the waiver or additional approvals or exemptions or 49 Table of Contents changes its policies, procedures or programs for those students, which could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the value of our common stock. If we fail or are unable to comply with current or future state licensing or authorization requirements, are unable to successfully obtain new required state approvals for our schools offering online education, or determine that we are unable to cost effectively comply with new or changed state licensing or authorization requirements, we could lose enrollments, eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs and revenues in any affected states, which could materially affect our revenues and our growth opportunities. Increased scrutiny by Congress and various governmental agencies regarding student loan activities has produced uncertainty concerning restrictions applicable to administration of Title IV Programs, the funding for those programs, and student lending activities. If these uncertainties are not satisfactorily or timely resolved, we may face increased regulatory burdens and costs or experience adverse impacts on our student enrollment. Investigations, claims, and actions against us and other postsecondary education providers could adversely affect our reputation, revenues, financial results and stock price. We and other postsecondary education providers have been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and litigation in recent years concerning student lending. State attorneys general, ED, the U.S. Congress and other parties have increasingly focused on student loan programs, including Title IV Programs, investigating allegations of conflicts of interest between some institutions and lenders that previously provided Title IV loans, lenders providing questionable incentives to schools or school employees, claims of deceptive marketing practices for student loans, and schools steering students to specific lenders. Several institutions and lenders have been cited for these problems and have made monetary payments to settle those claims. A number of schools, including some of our schools, have entered into codes of conduct regarding student referrals to lenders in various states. In response to allegations regarding student loan programs, Congress has passed new laws, ED has enacted stricter regulations, and several states have adopted codes of conduct or enacted state laws that further regulate the conduct of lenders, schools, and school personnel. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA), which took effect on July 1, 2010, eliminated the bank-based Federal Family Education Loan Program and all new federal student loans are being made through EDs William D. Ford Direct Loan Program. Under the Direct Loan Program, students borrow directly from ED instead of from banks, with EDs private sector partners disbursing, servicing and collecting the loans. Criticisms of the overall student lending and postsecondary education sectors may impact general public perception of educational institutions, including us, in a negative manner. Adverse media coverage regarding other educational institutions or regarding us directly could damage our reputation. The environment surrounding access to and cost of student loans remains in a state of flux. The uncertainty surrounding these issues, and any resolution of these issues that increases loan costs or reduces students access to Title IV loans, could reduce student demand for our programs, adversely impact our revenues and operating profit or result in increased regulatory scrutiny. If one or more of our schools fails to maintain institutional accreditation, if one or more of our accrediting agencies loses recognition by ED, or if certain of our programs cannot obtain or maintain programmatic accreditation, our schools could lose their ability to participate in Title IV Programs, and our growth prospects, reputation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In the U.S., accrediting agencies periodically review the academic quality of an institutions instructional programs and its administrative and financial operations to ensure that the institution has the resources to perform its educational mission. ED relies on accrediting agencies to assess whether an institutions educational programs qualify the school to participate in Title IV Programs. Furthermore, many states and professional associations require professional programs to be accredited, and require individuals who must pass professional license exams 50 Table of Contents to have graduated from accredited programs. While programmatic accreditation is not a sufficient basis to qualify for institutional Title IV Program certification, programmatic certification assists program graduates to practice as professionals or otherwise seek employment in their chosen field. Those of our programs that do not have such programmatic accreditation, or fail to maintain such accreditation, may experience adverse publicity, declining enrollments, or suffer other materially adverse impacts, which could result in it being impractical for us to continue offering such programs. On November 14, 2011, the Company received a letter from ACICS directing the Company, on behalf of 49 of its ACICS-accredited institutions in the Health Education and Art & Design segments, to show-cause at the ACICS December 2011 meeting as to why the Institutions current grants of accreditation should not be withdrawn by way of suspension. The show-cause directive relates to the adequacy of the administrative practices and controls relative to the Companys calculation of placement rates. We appeared before ACICS on December 7, 2011 and reviewed, among other things, the procedures we have implemented to ensure the accurate determination and reporting of placement rates. On December 13, 2011, ACICS advised us that it decided to defer further action on its show-cause directive until its next regularly scheduled meeting in April 2012. The directive now applies to all 71 of our schools accredited by ACICS, including the institutions in our Culinary Arts segment. ACICS acknowledged the efforts we had implemented to address concerns related to the verification of placement data, but has sought additional information regarding prior data and confirmation that the efforts will continue for a sustained period of time and be implemented at all campuses accredited by the agency. ACICS has requested that we provide certain additional information to ACICS in advance of the April 2012 meeting. While the show-cause directive is in effect, ACICS will not accept any applications for new programs or the initiation of additional locations or campus additions. As previously disclosed, the Companys Board of Directors directed independent legal counsel, Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP (Dewey), to conduct an investigation into the determination of placement rates at its Health Education segment schools. Subsequently, the Board of Directors directed Dewey to review placement rate determination practices at all of the Companys domestic schools. Dewey has completed its investigation and review and has reported the results of its investigation and review to the Board. Deweys review of the Companys domestic schools involved primarily an assessment of internal placement data that had not yet been made public or made available to students based on required reporting deadlines. In its review of the Companys remaining domestic schools, Dewey did not identify evidence of the types of improper placement determination practices that were previously identified at certain of the Companys Health Education segment schools. Dewey identified some errors in internal data at certain of the schools as well as certain unsupported placements, and the Company revised the data in accordance with these findings. The Company has reported the results of Deweys assessment of these schools to relevant regulatory and accrediting bodies, as appropriate. Our Health Education and Art & Design segment schools reported 2010-2011 placement rates to ACICS, taking into account Deweys assessment, in accordance with their annual reporting schedule. The ACICS placement rate standard for the 2010-2011 cohort was 65%. ACICS has announced a new tiered standard for the 2011-2012 cohort that has different levels of required remediation for institutional placement rates below 64%, 58% and 47%, respectively. It will also begin evaluating placement rates at the program level and applying associated remedial actions. Placement rates below these minimum standards subject an institution to increased accreditation oversight, which may include increased reporting requirements, a requirement that the institution submit a corrective action plan, attend workshops, undergo an on-site evaluation or restrictions on the addition of new locations or programs. ACICS may also initiate accreditation proceedings such as a show-cause directive (like the one pending), an action to defer or deny action related to an institutions application for a new grant of accreditation or an action to suspend an institutions accreditation if it fails to meet this standard. Based on their recently reported 2010-2011 placement rates, 13 of our 49 ACICS-accredited Health Education and Art & Design segment schools met ACICS 65% minimum placement rate standard for the 2010-2011 reporting period using the Companys internal definitions. ACICS or the Company could subsequently revise the data and determine that additional schools do not meet the minimum placement rate standard as a result of the continued 51 Table of Contents review of our schools 2010-2011 placement information. Other regulators have inquired about the basis and status of the ACICS show-cause directive and we continue to respond to all requests for information. In June 2011, Briarcliffe Colleges accrediting agency, Middle States Commission on Higher Education (Middle States), took action to continue the schools accreditation for a period not to exceed one year. Briarcliffe has advised Middle States of the NYAG investigation and our investigation into our determination of reported student placement rates. A further renewal of Briarcliffes accreditation by Middle States is subject to Briarcliffes submission of a monitoring report to Middle States by the earlier of March 1, 2012 or 30 days after completion of any report by the NYAG of its investigation. Middle States has also requested that Briarcliffe provide it with a progress report by April 1, 2013 documenting evidence of the use of multiple measures of the assessment of student learning at the institutional, program, and course levels and the use of appropriate assessments of the attainment of learning goals at the institutional, program and course levels. As noted above, the NYAG investigation remains open and Briarcliffe College is preparing the requested monitoring report due March 1, 2012. On November 28, 2011, Brown CollegeMendota Heights received a show-cause directive from its primary institutional accreditor, ACCSC, related to student achievement. Brown College submitted its response to the show-cause directive on February 6, 2012 that will be considered at the ACCSC commission meeting in May, 2012. If one of our schools or programs were to be placed on probationary accreditation status or failed to qualify for or maintain accreditation, we would likely experience additional adverse publicity, impaired ability to attract and retain students and substantial expense to obtain unqualified accreditation status. Any final loss of institutional accreditation after exhaustion of the administrative agency processes would result in a loss of Title IV Program funds for the affected school and its students. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our largest institutions are institutionally accredited by The Higher Learning Commission (HLC) of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, one of the six regional accrediting agencies recognized by ED. Almost all of our nationally accredited institutions are institutionally accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS) and several are jointly accredited by ACCSC and ACICS. Only the Le Cordon Bleu Institute of Culinary Arts campus in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is accredited only by ACCSC and is currently in the process of teaching out its programs. Accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the U. S. Department of Education is required in order for an institution to become and remain eligible to participate in Title IV programs and HLC, ACICS and ACCSC all satisfy this requirement. In January of 2009, after receiving an Alert Memorandum from the Office of Inspector General, Department staff conducted a review of HLC and developed in partnership with the agency a corrective action plan to address concerns raised by the Inspector General, including concerns about the agencys review of credit hours among its member institutions. As part of the corrective action plan, the agency was required to file interim reports with the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Improvement, which they did at the December 2010 and December 2011 meetings of the Advisory Board. In addition, the agency is in the process of adopting new standards for accreditation that address, among other things, the requirements of the new Program Integrity regulations regarding credit hour calculations. As evidence of continuing scrutiny of its recognized accreditors, at the June 2011 meeting of NACIQI, ACICS was one of four out of seven agencies that had applied for a five-year recognition, but instead received only a one year extension of their recognition during which time the agency must come into full compliance with all of the Departments accreditation standards. Our participation in Title IV Programs is dependent on ED continuing to recognize the accrediting agencies that accredit our colleges and universities. The standards and practices of these agencies have recently become a focus of attention by ED. If ED ceased to recognize a particular accrediting agency for any reason, our schools that are accredited by that accrediting agency would not be eligible to participate in Title IV Programs beginning 18 months after the date such recognition ceased, unless that accrediting agency was again recognized or our 52 Table of Contents schools that are accredited by that accrediting agency were accredited by another accrediting body recognized by ED. If our schools that are accredited by that accrediting agency became ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, the recent focus by the Office of Inspector General and ED on accrediting bodies may make the accreditation review process more challenging for all of our schools when they undergo their normal accreditation review processes in the future or may lead to ED ceasing to recognize certain accrediting bodies. If this occurred, our schools may have to incur additional costs and/or curtail or modify certain program offerings in order to maintain their accreditation, or become accredited by another accrediting body recognized by ED, which could increase our schools operational costs, reduce their enrollments and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We, and our business model, are subject to risks relating to enrollment of students. Given recent changes in the regulations affecting our operations, the U.S. economy, and other factors, there is a possibility of continued declines in our student population, which could materially adversely affect our business and revenues. A protracted economic slowdown and rising unemployment could harm our business, while an improving economy may lead to prospective students choosing to work rather than to pursue postsecondary education at our schools. For example, a protracted economic slowdown could increase unemployment and diminish job prospects generally, and diminished job prospects and heightened financial worries could affect the willingness of students to incur loans to pay for postsecondary education and to pursue postsecondary education in general. Conversely, an improving economy and improving job prospects may lead prospective students to choose to work rather than to pursue postsecondary education. As a result, our enrollments could suffer. As defined above, the new incentive compensation and misrepresentation rules may adversely affect our student recruiting and marketing efforts. Our business model has depended on student recruitment and retention services by our admissions counselors and our ability to attract and retain students at our schools through marketing, including use of third-party Internet lead generators that provide large numbers of potential student contacts. Our admissions representatives are responsible for identifying individuals interested in enrolling in our campuses. Admissions representatives serve as prospective students primary contacts, providing information to help them make informed enrollment decisions and assisting students with completing the enrollment process. EDs new incentive compensation rules eliminate safe harbors that previously allowed payment of certain compensation to our admissions advisors, financial aid advisors and certain third parties. We have changed the pay practices for these employees and contractual or other pay practices for third parties engaged in these efforts on our behalf, although there remains uncertainty under the new regulations as to what constitutes permissible pay practices. These changes, any new regulatory interpretation or guidance regarding these regulations, or any new legislation or rules impacting our recruiting practices, may result in employee retention issues, changes in our marketing practices that would lead to fewer prospective students, increased operating and marketing costs to identify prospective students, decreased enrollments or other impacts leading to changes in our business model, or other events that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The recent recession in the U.S. economy and congressional enactment of HCERA in March 2010 impacted students ability to finance their postsecondary educations, including limiting access to financial aid from sources other than Title IV Program funds. The recent recession caused many lenders, including lenders that previously provided Title IV Program loans to our students, to cease providing Title IV Program loans to students. Because HCERA eliminated fees paid to private banks to act as intermediaries in providing loans to college students, eliminated the FFEL Program, and required schools to transition to the Federal Direct Loan program by July 1, 2010, private lenders have exited the student loan market. As part of the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 (ECASLA) private lenders providing federal loans under the FFEL Program were afforded the ability to sell (or PUT) loans to ED as a means to ensure lender liquidity and students continued access to federal loans. These PUT loans would ultimately be transferred for servicing by ED preferred student loan 53 Table of Contents servicers. Initial review of reporting provided by ED related to PUT loan repayment performance has demonstrated a combination of record keeping errors and an increase in default rates relative to FFEL serviced loans during the same period. In addition to PUT loans serviced by EDs preferred servicers, ED is now responsible for originating and servicing all new federal student loans through the Federal Direct Loan program. Given early indications of servicing performance related to Direct Loans, student repayment risk may increase as a result of the transition causing an impact to our institutions cohort default rates which in turn could affect our institutions ability to maintain eligibility for Title IV Programs and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These changes may result in higher administrative costs for our schools related to student loan administration and extending student extended payment plans or grant programs to those students unable to timely replace student loan programs currently in place with exiting lenders. If the costs of Title IV loans increase and if availability of alternate student financial aid and payment plans decrease, students may decide not to enroll in a postsecondary institution, which could have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenues and results of operations. We had previously provided extended payment plans to certain students to help ensure that they could complete their educational programs. We have discontinued providing extended payment plans to new students. As of December 31, 2011, the amount of student receivables under student extended payment plans, net of allowance for doubtful accounts and net of deferred tuition revenue, was $7.3 million. The repayment risk associated with these extended payment plans has been higher than the risk associated with non-extended payment plan student receivables as evidenced by the historical repayment practices. Factors that may contribute to this higher risk of repayment include: the repayment period, which is typically up to ten years, the credit history of the student that is offered an extended payment plan as well as the overall economic environment. We are providing an allowance for doubtful accounts as student receivables related to these plans are recorded. The allowance rate being applied is approximately 75%, which is based upon historical repayment practices. Any further actions by the U.S. Congress, ED or other regulatory bodies that significantly reduce funding for Title IV Programs or the ability of our students to participate in those programs, that reduce alternate sources of student financial aid, or establish different or more stringent requirements for our U.S. schools to participate in Title IV Programs, could have a material adverse effect on our student population, course offerings, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Risks Related to Our Business The loss of our key personnel could harm us. Our future success depends largely on the skills, efforts and motivation of our executive officers and other key personnel, as well as on our ability to attract and retain qualified managers and our schools ability to attract and retain qualified faculty members and administrators. We face competition in retaining and hiring executives and key personnel who possess the skill sets and experiences that we seek. Our failure to fill openings for several officer positions or our loss of key personnel could slow implementation of key initiatives, lead to changes in or create uncertainty about our business strategies or otherwise impact managements attention to operations. In addition, key personnel may leave us and subsequently compete against us. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. 54 Table of Contents Budget constraints in states that provide state financial aid to our students could reduce available financial aid, which could adversely affect our student population. Alternatively, improved state financing may result in increased support for lower-priced public institutions, which may increase competition for students. A significant number of states in which our schools operate face budget constraints that may reduce state appropriations in a number of areas including state student financial aid, but we cannot predict the amount or timing of any such reductions. State grant programs generally benefit our institutions compliance with the 90-10 Rule. If state funding for our students decreases, our institutions compliance with the 90-10 Rule will be adversely affected, which could adversely impact our institutions eligibility for the Title IV Program. If our students are unable to secure alternative sources of funding for their education, our student population could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Increased state or federal support for public institutions and community colleges, resulting in increased competition for students, also could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If we are unable to successfully resolve pending or future litigation and regulatory and governmental inquiries involving us, or face increased regulatory actions or litigation, our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be adversely affected. We and certain of our current and former directors and executive officers have been named as defendants in various lawsuits, investigations and claims covering a range of matters, including, but not limited to, violations of the federal securities laws and claims made by current and former students and employees of our schools. These claims have included qui tam actions filed in federal court by individual plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and the federal government alleging that we submitted false claims or statements to ED in violation of the False Claims Act. Qui tam actions are filed under seal, and remain under seal until the government decides whether it will intervene in the case. If the government elects to intervene in an action, it assumes primary control of that matter; if the government elects not to intervene; individual plaintiffs may continue the litigation at their own expense on behalf of the government. See Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these matters. We and our schools also are subject to and have pending audits, compliance reviews, inquiries, investigations, claims of non-compliance and litigation by ED, federal and state regulatory agencies, accrediting agencies, state attorney general offices, present and former students and employees, and others that may allege violations of statutes, regulations, accreditation standards, consumer protection and other legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us or our schools. For example, we have received subpoenas from the Attorneys General of Florida and New York and a civil investigative demand from the Illinois Attorney General relating to potential non-compliance with applicable state laws and regulations by certain of our schools. If the results of any such audits, reviews, investigations, claims, or actions are unfavorable to us, we may be required to pay monetary damages or be subject to fines, operational limitations, loss of federal funding, injunctions, additional oversight and reporting, or other civil or criminal penalties. From time to time, we may have such matters pending against us respecting one or more of our schools, and as such, they would be discussed in Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements. Even if we maintain compliance with applicable governmental and accrediting body regulations, increased regulatory scrutiny or adverse publicity arising from allegations of non-compliance will increase our costs of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our financial results, growth rates and prospects. We are subject to a variety of other claims and litigation that arise from time to time alleging non-compliance with or violations of state or federal regulatory matters including, but not limited to, claims involving students, graduates and employees. In the event the extensive changes in the overall federal and state regulatory construct results in additional statutory or regulatory bases for these types of matters, or other events result in more of such claims or unfavorable outcomes to such claims, there exists the possibility of a material 55 Table of Contents adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial position, cash flows and results of operations for the periods in which the effects of any such matter or matters becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Congressional hearings and the continuing state attorneys general investigations affecting proprietary schools may spur plaintiffs law firms or others to initiate additional litigation against us and other proprietary education providers. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters and expect to continue to incur significant defense costs and other expenses in connection with them. We may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs in excess of our insurance coverage related to these matters. Government investigations, including the pending state attorneys general investigations in which we are involved, and any related legal and administrative proceedings may result in the institution of administrative, civil injunctive or criminal proceedings against us and/or our current or former directors, officers or employees, or the imposition of significant fines, penalties or suspensions, or other remedies and sanctions. Any such costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our common stock. If we are unable to establish new schools and new branch campuses of our existing schools, or to offer new educational programs, or fail to effectively operate new schools, branches and programs, our ability to grow may be slowed and our profitability may be adversely affected. As part of our growth strategy, we have opened new schools, new branch campuses or locations of our existing schools throughout the U.S. and offered new educational programs. These activities require us to invest in management and new personnel, make capital expenditures, incur marketing and advertising expenses, implement process and compliance training and procedures and devote resources that are different from those required to operate our existing schools. We may be unable to identify or acquire suitable expansion opportunities, or to successfully integrate a new school or branch campus. Any failure by us to effectively identify, establish and manage the operations of a new school or branch campus, or lapses in oversight of or maintenance of regulatory compliance or processes, could impact our ability to grow, could make any newly established school or branch campus more costly to operate than we had planned, could require additional investments in training of management and other personnel, or could lead to compliance issues, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, profitability, growth prospects and ability to compete and operate in our competitive markets. Additionally, ACICS has placed a restriction on any new programs or campuses at our ACICS accredited institutions while we are subject to the show-cause directive. We need timely approval by applicable regulatory agencies to offer new programs, expand our operations into or within certain states, or acquire additional schools. If those approvals are not timely, we may incur operating expenses (such as lease obligations) for significant time periods before we can enroll students. We are facing a period of extremely heightened regulatory scrutiny and, in the case of our ACICS accredited institutions, a complete restriction on new program and campus approvals. Additionally, we believe regulatory agencies are generally seeing significant increases in the volume of requests as a result of the industry adjusting to the significant volume of new regulations. Regulatory capacity constraints have resulted in delays to various approvals our institutions are requesting. To open a new school or branch campus, or to establish a new educational program, we are required to obtain the appropriate approvals from ED and applicable state and accrediting regulatory agencies, which may be conditioned, delayed or denied in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans. Approval by these regulatory agencies may be negatively impacted due to regulatory inquiries or reviews and any adverse publicity relating to such matters. Also, any adverse action taken by ED regarding its recognition of any accrediting agency that accredits our schools or programs could adversely impact our ability to open a new school or branch campus or establish new educational programs. In addition, to be eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, ED and applicable state and accrediting bodies must certify a new school or branch campus. 56 Table of Contents If we fail to effectively identify, pursue and integrate acquired schools, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S., our growth could be slowed and our profitability may be adversely affected. Acquisitions are one component of our overall long-term growth. From time to time, we engage in evaluations of, and discussions with, possible domestic and international acquisition candidates. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, acquire institutions on favorable terms, or successfully integrate or profitably operate acquired institutions. If we use debt to finance future acquisitions or issue securities in connection with future acquisitions, such actions could dilute the holdings of our stockholders. Because an acquisition is considered a change in ownership and control of the acquired institution under applicable regulatory standards, we must obtain approval from ED, most applicable state agencies and accrediting agencies and possibly other regulatory bodies when we acquire an institution. We have in the past, and may in the future, acquire schools in international markets. There may be difficulties and complexities associated with our expansion into international markets, and our strategies may not succeed beyond our current markets. If we do not effectively address these risks, our growth and ability to compete may be impaired. If changes in the regulatory environment or unavailability of Title IV Program funds to certain programs cause us to terminate programs, or lead to significant decreases in enrollments, we will incur costs and expenses associated with closing facilities or other exit activities. We may face excess capacity if student enrollments continue to decrease or if we decide to terminate offering of programs. We must balance current student populations and projected changes in student population with appropriate levels of investment in real estate and our online platforms in order to effectively manage capacity. Conversely, any increases in student enrollments may result in capacity constraints if our schools, particularly on-ground schools, are unable to adequately service the number of students enrolled or seeking to enroll in our programs. We are subject to the risks inherent in operating in foreign countries. We operate schools outside of the U.S. and are subject to risks inherent in having non-domestic operations, including foreign statutes and regulations for employees, students and postsecondary institutions, currency exchange rate fluctuations, limits on repatriation of profits, U.S.-foreign tax treaties and taxing authority, possible economic or political instability in those countries and risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, similar U.S. laws applicable to our operations in foreign markets, and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, effective July 1, 2011, holds American corporations responsible not only for violations committed by their United Kingdom subsidiaries but also for those subsidiaries actions in other countries. Our financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to keep pace with changing market needs and technology. Increasingly, prospective employers of students who graduate from our schools demand that their new employees possess appropriate technological skills and also appropriate soft skills, such as communication, critical thinking and teamwork skills. These skills can evolve rapidly in a changing economic and technological environment, so it is important for our schools educational programs to evolve in response to those economic and technological changes. Current or prospective students or the employers of our graduates may not accept expansion of our existing programs, improved program content and the development of new programs. Even if our schools are able to develop acceptable new and improved programs in a cost-effective manner, our schools may not be able to begin offering them as quickly as prospective employers would like or as quickly as our competitors offer similar programs. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to regulatory or financial constraints, rapid technological changes or other factors, our ability to attract and 57 Table of Contents retain students could be impaired, the rates at which our graduates obtain jobs involving their fields of study could decline, and our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, to support our growth, we must hire, retain, develop and train qualified admissions representatives who are dedicated to student recruitment. If we are unable to hire, develop and train qualified admissions representatives, the effectiveness of our student recruiting efforts could be adversely affected. If our graduates are unable to obtain professional licenses or certification in their chosen field of study, we may face declining enrollments and revenues or student claims against us. Many of our students, particularly in the healthcare programs we offer, require or desire professional licenses and certifications in order to obtain employment in their chosen fields. Many factors affect a students ability to become licensed, including whether the students program and institution are accredited by a particular accrediting commission or approved by a professional association or by the state in which the student seeks employment, and the students own qualifications and attainment. If one or more states, local governments or major employers deny licenses, certifications or employment eligibility to a significant number of our students due to factors relating to our institutions or programs, we could suffer reputational harm and declining enrollments in those institutions or programs, or face student claims or litigation that could affect our revenues and results of operations. Our future financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are required to write down the carrying value of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, including long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets, such as our trade names. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we review our non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, including goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names, for impairment on at least an annual basis through the application of fair value-based measurements. We determined the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach, based on discounted cash flow, and a market-based approach. To the extent the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we may be required to record an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations. We determined the fair value of our trade names using a relief from royalty method which is based on the assumption that, in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset, a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to enjoy the benefits of the asset. To the extent the fair value of the trade name is less than its carrying amount, we record an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations. Our estimates of fair value for these are based primarily on projected future results and expected cash flows consistent with our plans to manage the underlying businesses. We recorded goodwill and asset impairment charges of $191.5 million during fiscal 2011. See Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. To the extent known, we incorporated the risks associated with regulatory compliance into the discount rates used to estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units at December 31, 2011. However, should we need to take additional actions not currently foreseen to comply with current and future regulations, the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of our reporting units, including the estimate of future cash flows, revenue growth, and discount rates, could be negatively impacted and could result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We could experience decreasing enrollments in our schools due to changing demographic trends in family size, overall declines in enrollment in postsecondary schools, job growth in fields unrelated to our core disciplines, immigration and visa laws, or other societal factors. A March 2011 NCES report projects that between 2008 and 2019 enrollments in degree-granting postsecondary institutions will increase 17% to 22.4 million students. This projected 11-year growth rate is lower than the 34% increase NCES reported for the 14-year period 1994-2008 of 14.3 million in 1994 to 19.1 million in 2008. Such a decline in the overall growth rate in the postsecondary education sector would result in increased 58 Table of Contents competition for students for our programs and could impact our ability to attract and retain students and affect our ability to increase our enrollments. In addition, the ability of our foreign students to obtain visas for our U.S. and our European schools is important to student recruitment. If we cannot attract new students, or develop new curricula to attract prospective students who seek degrees in fields other than our core disciplines, or accommodate changed immigration or visa rules, we may be unable to maintain and increase our student population or achieve our growth strategies, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations, financial condition and market price of our common stock. Capacity constraints or system disruptions to our online computer networks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain students. Our schools online programs intend to increase student population. To support this growth, we will require more resources, including additional faculty, admissions, academic and financial aid personnel. This growth may place a significant strain on the operational resources of our schools. Our schools online programs success depends, in part, on our schools ability to expand the content of their programs, develop new programs in a cost-effective manner, maintain good standing with regulators and accreditors, and meet students needs in a timely manner. New programs can be delayed due to current and future unforeseen regulatory restrictions. Furthermore, our regulators may impose additional restrictions or conditions on the manner in which we offer online courses to our students, any one of which could negatively impact our business or results of operations. Any general decline in Internet use for any reason, including security or privacy concerns, cost of Internet service or changes in government regulation, could result in less demand for online educational services and inhibit our planned growth in our online programs. For our online and on-ground campuses, the performance and reliability of program infrastructure is critical to their operations, reputation and ability to attract and retain students. Any computer system error or failure, significant increase in traffic on our computer networks, or any significant failure or unavailability of our computer networks, including but not limited to those as a result of natural disasters and network and telecommunications failures could materially disrupt our delivery of these programs. Our computer networks may also be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses and other security threats. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Due to the sensitive nature of the information contained on our networks hackers may target our networks. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches. Although we continually monitor the security of our technology infrastructure, we cannot assure that these efforts will protect our computer networks against security breaches. Any interruption to our schools computer systems or operations could have a material adverse effect on our student population, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of class materials posted online for class discussions. In some instances our faculty members or our students may post various articles or other third-party content on class discussion boards or download third-party content to personal computers. We may incur claims or liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and could impose a strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. 59 Table of Contents Our financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop awareness and acceptance of our schools and programs among high school graduates and working adults. If our schools are unable to successfully market and advertise their educational programs, our schools ability to attract and enroll prospective students in such programs could be adversely affected, and, consequently, our ability to increase revenue or maintain profitability could be impaired. Some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully marketing and advertising our schools and the programs that they offer include, but are not limited to, student or employer dissatisfaction with educational programs and services, diminished access to high school students, our failure to maintain or expand our brand names or other factors related to our marketing or advertising practices, Federal Trade Commission restrictions on Internet and other advertising and marketing media, costs and effectiveness of Internet and other advertising programs, and changing media preferences of our target audiences. We compete with a variety of educational institutions, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our student population and revenue could be adversely impacted. Postsecondary education is a highly fragmented and competitive field. Our schools compete with traditional public and private two-year and four-year colleges and universities, other proprietary schools, other online education providers, and alternatives to higher education, such as immediate employment and military service. Some public and private institutions charge lower tuition for courses of study similar to those offered by our schools due, in part, to government subsidies, government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions and other financial resources not available to proprietary institutions. Our competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. We expect to experience increased competition as more colleges, universities, and other postsecondary education providers increase their online program offerings. An increase in competition could affect the success of our marketing efforts and enable our competitors to recruit prospective students more effectively, or reduce our tuition charges and increase spending for marketing efforts, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our credit agreement limits our ability to take various actions and requires that we satisfy specified financial and non-financial covenants. Our credit agreement limits our ability to take various actions, including paying dividends and disposing of assets, and may restrict us from taking actions that management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders. Our credit agreement provides that our failure to comply with regulations issued by ED or other governmental authorities or our failure to satisfy specified financial and non-financial covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement. An event of default would allow the lenders to pursue various remedies, including accelerating the repayment of any indebtedness outstanding, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Our credit agreement expires on October 31, 2012 and there is no assurance it will be extended or replaced. Our credit agreement expires on October 31, 2012. If we are unable to renew the credit agreement or obtain replacement financing on satisfactory terms, our ability to fund our operations and capital expenditures could be materially negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. We are subject to privacy and information security laws and regulations both domestically and in the countries in which our foreign schools operate, due to our collection and use of personal information. Any violations of those laws, or any breach, theft or loss of that information, could adversely affect our reputation and operations. Our efforts to attract and enroll students result in us collecting, using and keeping substantial amounts of personal information regarding applicants, our students, faculty, their families and alumni, including social 60 Table of Contents security numbers, financial data or health data. We also maintain personal information about our employees in the ordinary course of our activities. Our services, the services of many of our health plan and benefit plan vendors, and other information can be accessed globally through the Internet. We rely extensively on our network of interconnected applications and databases for day to day operations as well as financial reporting and the processing of financial transactions. Our computer networks and those of our vendors that manage confidential information for us may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, theft or misuse, hackers, computer viruses, or third parties in connection with hardware and software upgrades and changes. Such unauthorized access, misuse, theft or hacks could evade our intrusion detection and prevention precautions without alerting us to the breach or loss for some period of time or may never be detected. We have experienced malware and virus attacks on our systems which went undetected by our virus detection and prevention software. Regular patching of our computer systems and frequent updates to our virus detection and prevention software with the latest virus and malware signatures may not catch newly introduced malware and viruses or zero-day viruses, prior to their infecting our systems and potentially disrupting our data integrity, taking sensitive information or affecting financial transactions. Because our services can be accessed globally via the Internet, we may be subject to privacy laws in countries outside the U.S. from which students access our services, which laws may constrain the way we market and provide our services. While we utilize security and business controls to limit access to and use of personal information, any breach of student or employee privacy or errors in storing, using or transmitting personal information could violate privacy laws and regulations resulting in fines or other penalties. A breach, theft or loss of personal information held by us or our vendors, or a violation of the laws and regulations governing privacy could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or result in additional regulation, compliance costs or investments in additional security systems to protect our computer networks causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We rely on exclusive proprietary rights and intellectual property that may not be adequately protected under current laws, and we may encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of intellectual property of third parties. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, domain names and agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on service mark and trademark protection in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions to protect our rights to our marks as well as distinctive logos and other marks associated with our services. We cannot assure you that these measures will be adequate, that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all of our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts to protect these rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to duplicate the proprietary aspects of our curricula, online resource material and other content. Our managements attention may be diverted by these attempts, and we may need to use funds in litigation to protect our proprietary rights against any infringement or violation. We may encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and we may not prevail in these disputes. Third parties may raise a claim against us alleging an infringement or violation of the intellectual property of that third party. Some third party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid those intellectual property rights. Any such intellectual property claim could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether such claim has merit. We may incur costs in complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act and with similar laws. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA, requires all public accommodations to meet federal requirements for access and use by disabled individuals. Other federal, state, and local laws and regulations also may impose similar or additional accessibility requirements. For example, the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, or FHAA, requires apartment properties first occupied after March 13, 1991, to be accessible to handicapped persons. Typically, our real estate leases require us to pay any costs necessary to comply with all 61 Table of Contents laws, including these accessibility laws, for our premises, which may include parking areas, restaurants at our culinary schools, dormitory facilities and similar facilities in addition to classroom and office space. In opening new schools or locations and acquiring existing schools, we often must build out the premises to satisfy our classroom needs and must incur the costs associated with accessibility compliance in those construction activities. If any of our premises are not compliant with the ADA or FHAA, we could face fines, litigation by private litigants, and orders to correct any non-complying features. Risk Related to Our Common Stock The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially in the future. The trading price of our common stock has and may fluctuate substantially as a result of a number of factors, some of which are not in our control. These factors include:  loss of key personnel;  the initiation, pendency or outcome of litigation, accreditation reviews, regulatory reviews and investigations, including the pending state attorneys general investigations in which we are involved, and any related adverse publicity;  failure of certain of our schools in our Health Education and Art & Design segments to meet minimum placement rates for 2010-2011 established by our schools accreditors;  failure satisfactorily to resolve the show-cause proceeding of our ACICS-accredited schools that was initiated in November 2011;  failure of certain of our institutions to maintain compliance under the 90-10 Rule;  the outcomes and impacts on our business of EDs rulemakings, and other changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which we operate;  changes in the student lending and credit markets;  our ability to meet or exceed expectations of analysts or investors;  quarterly variations in our operating results;  general conditions in the postsecondary education field, including changes in ED, state laws and regulations and accreditation standards, or availability of student financing;  changes in our earnings estimates by analysts;  future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets;  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, which have particularly affected the market prices of many companies that provide postsecondary education in recent periods; and  general economic conditions. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance, and could prevent an investor from selling shares of our common stock at or above the price at which the investor acquired the shares. In addition, the stock markets, from time to time, experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 62 Table of Contents
