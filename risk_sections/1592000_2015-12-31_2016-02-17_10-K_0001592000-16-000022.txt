Item 1A. Risk FactorsThe following risk factors and all other information contained in this report should be considered carefully when evaluating us. These risk factors could affect our actual results. Other risks and uncertainties, in addition to those that are described below, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be affected materially and adversely. In that case, we may be unable to make distributions to our unitholders and the trading price of our common units could decline. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning us set forth in our accompanying financial statements and notes and contained in “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included herein.Risks Inherent in an Investment in EnLink Midstream Devon owns approximately 64.2% of our outstanding common units as of February 10, 2016 and controls the Managing Member, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Our manager and its affiliates, including Devon, have conflicts of interest with us and limited duties to us and may favor their own interests to your detriment.Devon owns and controls the Managing Member and appoints all of the directors of the Managing Member, subject to, in certain circumstances, the approval of a majority of our independent directors and our Chief Executive Officer. Some of the directors of the Managing Member are also directors or officers of Devon. Although the Managing Member has a duty to manage us in a manner it subjectively believes to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests, the directors and officers of the Managing Member also have a duty to manage the Managing Member in a manner that is in the best interests of Devon, in its capacity as the sole member of the Managing Member. Conflicts of interest may arise between Devon and its affiliates, including the Managing Member, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, the Managing Member may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our unitholders. These conflicts include, among others, the following situations:•neither our operating agreement nor any other agreement requires Devon to pursue a business strategy that favors us, to enter into any commercial agreements with us or the Partnership, or, except as set forth in a first offer agreement pursuant to which Devon is obligated to offer us a right of first offer with respect to its interest in the Access Pipeline transportation system (the “First Offer Agreement”), to sell any assets to us or the Partnership. Devon’s directors and officers have a fiduciary duty to make decisions in the best interests of the owners of Devon, which may be contrary to our interests;•Devon may be constrained by the terms of its debt instruments from taking actions, or refraining from taking actions, that may be in our best interests;•Devon, as a major customer of the Partnership, has an economic incentive to cause the Partnership to not seek higher transportation rates and processing fees, even if such higher rates or fees would reflect rates and fees that could be obtained in arm’s-length, third-party transactions;•the Managing Member determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, issuance of additional membership interests and reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available to be distributed to unitholders;•the Managing Member determines which costs incurred by it are reimbursable by us;•the Managing Member is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us in exercising certain rights under our operating agreement;28•our operating agreement limits the liability of, and eliminates and replaces the fiduciary duties that would otherwise be owed by, the Managing Member and also restricts the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without the provisions of the operating agreement, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty;•any future contracts between us, on the one hand, and the Managing Member and its affiliates, on the other, will not be the result of arm’s-length negotiations;• except in limited circumstances, the Managing Member will have the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval;•disputes may arise under commercial agreements between Devon and us or our subsidiaries, including the Partnership;•the Managing Member may exercise its right to call and purchase all of our outstanding common units not owned by it and its affiliates if it and its affiliates own more than 90% of our outstanding common units;•the Managing Member controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by the Managing Member and its affiliates, including the commercial agreements and the First Offer Agreement with Devon; and• the Managing Member decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us.Devon may compete with us.Devon may compete with us, including by developing or acquiring additional gathering and processing assets. Pursuant to the terms of our operating agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to the Managing Member or any of its affiliates, including Devon and its executive officers and directors. Any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for us will not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to us. Any such person or entity will not be liable to us or to any of our members for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to us. This may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between us and affiliates of the Managing Member and result in less than favorable treatment of us and our unitholders. Cost reimbursements due to the Managing Member and its affiliates for services provided, which will be determined by the Managing Member, could be substantial and would reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders.Prior to making distributions on our common units, we will reimburse the Managing Member and its affiliates for all expenses they incur on our behalf. These expenses will include all costs incurred by the Managing Member and its affiliates in managing and operating us, including costs for rendering corporate staff and support services to us, if any. There is no limit on the amount of expenses for which the Managing Member and its affiliates may be reimbursed. Our operating agreement provides that the Managing Member will determine the expenses that are allocable to us. In addition, to the extent the Managing Member incurs obligations on behalf of us, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify the Managing Member. If we are unable or unwilling to reimburse or indemnify the Managing Member, the Managing Member may take actions to cause us to make payments of these obligations and liabilities. Any such payments could reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.Our operating agreement replaces the fiduciary duties otherwise owed to our unitholders by the Managing Member with contractual standards governing its duties.Our operating agreement contains provisions that eliminate and replace the fiduciary standards that the Managing Member would otherwise be held to by state fiduciary duty law. For example, our operating agreement permits the Managing Member to make a number of decisions, in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as the Managing Member, or otherwise, free of fiduciary duties to us and our unitholders. This entitles the Managing Member to consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our members. Examples of decisions that the Managing Member may make in its individual capacity include:•how to allocate business opportunities among us and its other affiliates;•whether to exercise its call right;•how to exercise its voting rights with respect to any membership interests it owns;•whether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation of us or any amendment to our operating agreement; and•whether or not the manager should elect to seek the approval of the conflicts committee or the unitholders, or neither, of any conflicted transaction.By purchasing any of our common units, a unitholder is treated as having consented to the provisions in our operating agreement, including the provisions discussed above. 29Our operating agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of our membership interests for actions taken by the Managing Member that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.Our operating agreement contains provisions that restrict the remedies available to holders of our common units for actions taken by the Managing Member that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our operating agreement provides that:•whenever the Managing Member makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as the Managing Member, the Managing Member is required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, and will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;• the Managing Member will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a managing member so long as it acted in good faith, meaning that it subjectively believed that the decision was in, or not opposed to, our best interests;• our operating agreement is governed by Delaware law and any claims, suits, actions or proceedings:•arising out of or relating in any way to our operating agreement (including any claims, suits or actions to interpret, apply or enforce the provisions of our operating agreement or the duties, obligations or liabilities among members or of members to us, or the rights or powers of, or restrictions on, the members or the company);•brought in a derivative manner on our behalf;•asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or the Managing Member, or owed by the Managing Member, to us or our members;• asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DLLCA; or•asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine;•must be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, any other court located in the State of Delaware with subject matter jurisdiction), regardless of whether such claims, suits, actions or proceedings sound in contract, tort, fraud or otherwise, are based on common law, statutory, equitable, legal or other grounds, or are derivative or direct claims. By purchasing our common units, a member is irrevocably consenting to these limitations and provisions regarding claims, suits, actions or proceedings and submitting to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or such other Delaware courts) in connection with any such claims, suits, actions or proceedings;•the Managing Member and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our members resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the Managing Member or its officers or directors, as the case may be, acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct, or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was unlawful; and•the Managing Member will not be in breach of its obligations under our operating agreement or its duties to us or our members if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is:•approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of the Managing Member, although the Managing Member is not obligated to seek such approval; or•approved by the vote of a majority of our outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by the Managing Member and its affiliates, although the Managing Member is not obligated to seek such approval.Our manager will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions whether or not to seek the approval of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of the Managing Member or holders of a majority of our common units, excluding any common units owned by the Managing Member and its affiliates. If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by the holders of our common units or the conflicts committee then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, taking any action or failing to act, the board of directors acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any member or us, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption. 30Holders of our common units will have limited voting rights and will not be entitled to elect the Managing Member or the board of directors of the Managing Member, which could reduce the price at which our common units will trade.Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, our unitholders will have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management’s decisions regarding our business. Unitholders do not have the right to elect the Managing Member or the board of directors of the Managing Member on an annual or other continuing basis. The board of directors of the Managing Member, including its independent directors, is chosen by the sole member of the Managing Member, subject, in certain circumstances, to the approval of a majority of our independent directors and our Chief Executive Officer. Furthermore, if unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of the Managing Member, they will have very limited ability to remove the Managing Member. Our operating agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders’ ability to influence the manner or direction of management. As a result of these limitations, the price at which our common units trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. Even if our unitholders are dissatisfied, they cannot initially remove the Managing Member without its consent.Our unitholders are unable to remove the Managing Member without its consent because the Managing Member and its affiliates own sufficient units to be able to prevent its removal. The vote of the holders of at least 662/3% of all outstanding common units voting together as a single class is required to remove the managing member. As of February 10, 2016, the Managing Member and its affiliates owned approximately 65.3% of the outstanding EnLink Midstream Common Units.Our operating agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units.Unitholders’ voting rights are further restricted by our operating agreement, which provides that any units held by a person that owns 20% or more of any class of units, other than the Managing Member, its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of the Managing Member, cannot vote on any matter.Control of the Managing Member may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.Our manager may transfer its managing member interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Furthermore, our operating agreement does not restrict the ability of Devon to transfer all or a portion of the ownership interest in the Managing Member to a third party. If the managing member interest were transferred, the new owner of the Managing Member would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of the Managing Member with its own choices and thereby exert significant control over the decisions made by such board of directors and officers. This effectively permits a “change of control” of the Managing Member without the vote or consent of the unitholders.We may issue additional units, including units that are senior to our common units, without your approval, which would dilute your existing ownership interests.Our operating agreement does not limit the number of additional membership interests that we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders. The issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:•each unitholder’s proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;•the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;•the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and•the market price of our common units may decline.Devon may sell our common units in the public markets or otherwise, which sales could have an adverse impact on the trading price of our common units.As of February 10, 2016, Devon held 115,495,669 common units. Additionally, we have agreed to provide Devon with certain registration rights with respect to the common units held by it. The sale of these units could have an adverse impact on the price of the our common units or on any trading market that may develop.Our manager has a call right that may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price.If at any time the Managing Member and its affiliates own more than 90% of our common units, the Managing Member will have the right, but not the obligation, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of our common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price equal to the greater of (1) the average of the daily closing price of our common units over the 20 trading days preceding the date three days before notice of exercise of the call right is first mailed and (2) the highest per-unit price paid by the Managing Member or any of its affiliates for our common units during the 90-day period preceding the date such notice is first mailed. As a result, unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return or a negative return on their investment. Unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their units. Our manager is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of 31our common nits to be repurchased by it upon exercise of the call right. There is no restriction in our operating agreement that prevents the Managing Member from issuing additional common units and exercising its call right. If the Managing Member exercised its call right, the effect would be to take us private. As of February 10, 2016, Devon owned an aggregate of approximately 64.2% of our common units. Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them.Under certain circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under the DLLCA, a limited liability company may not make a distribution to a member if, after the distribution, all liabilities of the limited liability company, other than liabilities to members on account of their membership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the company, would exceed the fair value of the assets of the limited liability company. For the purpose of determining the fair value of the assets of a limited liability company, the DLLCA provides that the fair value of property subject to liability for which recourse of creditors is limited shall be included in the assets of the limited liability company only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds the non-recourse liability. The DLLCA provides that a member who receives a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution was in violation of the DLLCA will be liable to the limited liability company for the amount of the distribution for three years.The price of our common units may fluctuate significantly, which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.As of February 10, 2016, only approximately 34.7% of our common units are held by public unitholders. The lack of liquidity may result in wide bid-ask spreads, contribute to significant fluctuations in the market price of our common units and limit the number of investors who are able to buy our common units. The market price of our common units may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:•the quarterly distributions paid by us with respect to our common units;• our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;•the loss of Devon as a customer;•events affecting Devon;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions;•changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;•general economic conditions;• the failure of securities analysts to cover our common units or changes in financial estimates by analysts;•future sales of our common units; and•other factors described in these “Risk Factors.”We are a “controlled company” within the meaning of NYSE rules and, as a result, we qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from some of the listing requirements with respect to independent directors.Because Devon controls more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors of the Managing Member, we are a controlled company within the meaning of NYSE rules, which exempt controlled companies from the following corporate governance requirements:•the requirement that a majority of the board consist of independent directors;• the requirement that the board of directors have a nominating or corporate governance committee, composed entirely of independent directors, that is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become board members, consistent with criteria approved by the board, selection of board nominees for the next annual meeting of equity holders, development of corporate governance guidelines and oversight of the evaluation of the board and management;•the requirement that we have a compensation committee of the board, composed entirely of independent directors, that is responsible for reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to chief executive officer compensation, evaluation of the chief executive officer’s performance in light of the goals and objectives, determination and approval of the chief executive officer’s compensation, making recommendations to the board with respect to compensation of other executive officers and incentive compensation and equity-based plans that are subject to board approval and producing a report on executive compensation to be included in an annual proxy statement or Form 10-K filed with the SEC;•the requirement that we conduct an annual performance evaluation of the nominating, corporate governance and compensation committees; and•the requirement that we have written charters for the nominating, corporate governance and compensation committees addressing the committees’ responsibilities and annual performance evaluations.32For so long as we remain a controlled company, we will not be required to have a majority of independent directors or nominating, corporate governance or compensation committees. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.Our cash flow consists almost exclusively of distributions from the Partnership.Currently, our only cash-generating assets are our partnership interests in the Partnership. Our cash flow is therefore completely dependent upon the ability of the Partnership to make distributions to its partners. Accordingly, you should read and consider the risk factors described under the caption “Risks Inherent in the Partnership's Business.” The amount of cash that the Partnership can distribute to its partners, including us, each quarter principally depends upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:•the amount of natural gas transported in its gathering and transmission pipelines;•the level of the Partnership's processing operations;•the fees the Partnership charges and the margins it realizes for its services;•the prices of, levels of production of and demand for crude oil, condensate, NGLs and natural gas;•the volume of natural gas the Partnership gathers, compresses, processes, transports and sells, the volume of NGLs the Partnership processes or fractionates and sells, the volume of crude oil the Partnership handles at its crude terminals, the volume of crude oil and condensate the Partnership gathers, transports, purchases and sells, the volumes of condensate stabilized and the volumes of brine the Partnership disposes;•the relationship between natural gas and NGL prices; and•the Partnership's level of operating costs.In addition, the actual amount of cash the Partnership will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, some of which are beyond its control, including:•the level of capital expenditures the Partnership makes;•the cost of acquisitions, if any;•the Partnership’s debt service requirements;•fluctuations in its working capital needs;•the Partnership’s ability to make working capital borrowings under its bank credit facility to pay distributions;•prevailing economic conditions; and•the amount of cash reserves established by its respective general partners in its sole discretion for the proper conduct of business.Because of these factors, the Partnership may not be able, or may not have sufficient available cash to pay distributions to unitholders each quarter. Furthermore, you should also be aware that the amount of cash the Partnership has available for distribution depends primarily upon its cash flows, including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings, and is not solely a function of profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, the Partnership may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net income.Although we control the Partnership, the General Partner owes fiduciary duties to the Partnership and the unitholders.Conflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future as a result of the relationship between us and our affiliates, including the General Partner, on the one hand, and the Partnership and its limited partners, on the other hand. The directors and officers of EnLink Midstream GP, LLC have fiduciary duties to manage the General Partner in a manner beneficial to us, its owner. At the same time, the General Partner has a fiduciary duty to manage the Partnership in a manner beneficial to the Partnership and its limited partners. The board of directors of EnLink Midstream GP, LLC will resolve any such conflict and has broad latitude to consider the interests of all parties to the conflict. The resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our best interest or that of our unitholders.For example, conflicts of interest may arise in the following situations:•the allocation of shared overhead expenses to the Partnership and us;•the interpretation and enforcement of contractual obligations between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and the Partnership, on the other hand;•the determination of the amount of cash to be distributed to the Partnership’s partners and the amount of cash to be reserved for the future conduct of the Partnership’s business;33•the determination whether to make borrowings under the Partnership’s credit facility to pay distributions to partners; and•any decision we make in the future to engage in activities in competition with the Partnership.If the General Partner is not fully reimbursed or indemnified for obligations and liabilities it incurs in managing the business and affairs of the Partnership, its value, and therefore the value of our common units, could decline.The General Partner may make expenditures on behalf of the Partnership for which it will seek reimbursement from the Partnership. In addition, under Delaware law, the General Partner, in its capacity as the General Partner of the Partnership, has unlimited liability for the obligations of the Partnership, such as its debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations of the Partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the General Partner. To the extent the General Partner incurs obligations on behalf of the Partnership, it is entitled to be reimbursed or indemnified by the Partnership. In the event that the Partnership is unable or unwilling to reimburse or indemnify the General Partner, the General Partner may be unable to satisfy these liabilities or obligations, which would reduce its value and therefore the value of our common units.If in the future we cease to manage and control the Partnership, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.If we cease to manage and control the Partnership and are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, we would either have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, obtain exemptive relief from the SEC or modify our organizational structure or our contractual rights so as to fall outside the definition of an investment company. Registering as an investment company could, among other things, materially limit our ability to engage in transactions with affiliates, including the purchase and sale of certain securities or other property to or from our affiliates, restrict our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage and require us to add additional directors who are independent of us and our affiliates, and adversely affect the price of our common units.We are treated as a corporation subject to entity level federal and state income taxation. Any such entity level income taxes will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to you.We are treated as a corporation for tax purposes that is required to pay federal and state income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates. Historically, we have had net operating losses that eliminated substantially all of our taxable income and, thus, we historically have not had to pay material amounts of income taxes. We anticipate generating net operating losses for tax purposes during 2016, and as a result, do not expect to incur material amounts of federal and state income tax liabilities. In the event we do generate taxable income, federal and state income tax liabilities will reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders.The terms of our credit facility may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in business or to take certain actions.Our credit agreement contains, and any future indebtedness we incur will likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long-term interest. In addition, our credit facility requires us to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios and tests.A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, all amounts outstanding under the credit facility could be declared to be immediately due and payable and all applicable commitments to extend further credit could be terminated. If we are unable to repay the accelerated debt under our credit facility, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged the Partnership common units and the 100% membership interest in the General Partner that are indirectly held by us and our 100% equity interest in each of our wholly-owned subsidiaries as collateral under our credit facility. If indebtedness under our credit facility is accelerated, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our credit facility and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.Certain events of default under the Partnership’s credit facility, the occurrence of certain bankruptcy events affecting the Partnership or our failure to continue to control the Partnership could constitute an event of default under our credit facility.Under the terms of our credit facility, certain events of default under the Partnership’s credit facility could constitute an event of default under our credit facility. Additionally, certain events of default under our credit facility relate specifically to events relating to the Partnership, including certain bankruptcy events affecting the Partnership or any event that causes us to no longer indirectly control the Partnership. Additionally, any default by the Partnership under the terms of its credit facility could limit its ability to make distributions to us.34Risks Inherent in the Partnership's BusinessThe Partnership is dependent on Devon for substantially all of the natural gas that it gathers, processes and transports. After the minimum volume commitments from Devon expire in 2018, a material decline in the volumes of natural gas that the Partnership gathers, processes and transports for Devon could result in a material decline in the Partnership's operating results and cash available for distribution.The Partnership relies on Devon for a substantial portion of its natural gas supply. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Devon represented a 16.6% of our consolidated revenues. In order to minimize volumetric exposure, in March 2014 the Partnership obtained five-year minimum volume commitments from Devon at the Bridgeport processing facility, Bridgeport and East Johnson County gathering systems and the Cana system. After the expiration of these five-year minimum volume commitments in 2019, a material decline in the volume of natural gas that the Partnership gathers and transports on its systems would result in a material decline in our combined total operating revenues and cash flow. In addition, Devon may determine in the future that drilling activity in areas of operation other than the Partnership's is strategically more attractive. A shift in Devon’s focus away from the Partnership's areas of operation could result in reduced throughput on the Partnership's systems after the five-year minimum volume commitments expire and cause a material decline in our total operating revenues and cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Partnership recognized $3.8 million under the minimum volume commitments attributable to its Texas Segment because volumes have been below the minimum level since August 2015. The Partnership also recognized $20.1 million under the minimum volume commitments attributable to its Oklahoma Segment because volumes have been below the minimum levels since June 2014. However, for the fourth quarter of 2015 volumes delivered to Cana exceeded minimum volume requirements.Because the Partnership is substantially dependent on Devon as its primary customer and through Devon’s control of us and our control of the General Partner, any development that materially and adversely affects Devon’s operations, financial condition or market reputation could have a material and adverse impact on the Partnership and us. Material adverse changes at Devon could restrict our access to capital, make it more expensive to access the capital markets or increase the costs of our or the Partnership’s borrowings.The Partnership is substantially dependent on Devon as its primary customer and through Devon’s control of us and our control of the General Partner, and we expect the Partnership to derive a substantial majority of its gross operating margin from Devon for the foreseeable future. As a result, any event, whether in the Partnership's area of operations or otherwise, that adversely affects Devon’s production, financial condition, leverage, market reputation, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows may adversely affect the Partnership's revenues and cash available for distribution. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the business risks of Devon, some of which are the following:•potential changes in the supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs and related products and services;•risks relating to Devon’s exploration and drilling programs, including potential environmental liabilities;•adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation; and•general economic and financial market conditions.Further, the Partnership is subject to the risk of non-payment or non-performance by Devon, including with respect to the Partnership's gathering and processing agreements. We cannot predict the extent to which Devon’s business will be impacted by the continuing deterioration of pricing conditions in the energy industry, nor can we estimate the impact such conditions would have on Devon’s ability to perform under the Partnership's gathering and processing agreements. Additionally, due to our relationship with Devon, our or the Partnership’s ability to access the capital markets, or the pricing or other terms of any capital markets transactions, may be adversely affected by any impairments to Devon’s financial condition or adverse changes in its credit ratings. On February 2, 2016, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (“S&P”) downgraded Devon to a BBB credit rating. Any material limitations on our or the Partnership’s ability to access capital as a result of such adverse changes at Devon could limit our ability to obtain future financing under favorable terms, or at all, or could result in increased financing costs in the future. Similarly, material adverse changes at Devon could negatively impact our or the Partnership’s unit price, limiting our ability to raise capital through equity issuances or debt financing or our ability to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities and could also prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us.Please see Item 1. A in Devon’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a full discussion of the risks associated with Devon’s business.Adverse developments in the Partnership's gathering, transmission, processing, crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGL services businesses would reduce its ability to make distributions to its unitholders.The Partnership relies exclusively on the revenues generated from its gathering, transmission, processing, fractionation, crude oil, natural gas, condensate and NGL services businesses and as a result its financial condition depends upon prices of, 35and continued demand for, natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate. An adverse development in one of these businesses may have a significant impact on the Partnership's financial condition and its ability to make distributions to its unitholders.A significant portion of the Partnership's operations are located in the Barnett Shale, making the Partnership vulnerable to risks associated with having revenue-producing operations concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas.The Partnership's revenue-producing operations are geographically concentrated in the Barnett Shale, causing it to be disproportionally exposed to risks associated with regional factors. Specifically, the Partnership's operations in the Barnett Shale accounted for approximately 17.4% of its consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. The concentration of the Partnership's operations in this region also increases exposure to unexpected events that may occur in this region such as natural disasters or labor difficulties. Any one of these events has the potential to have a relatively significant impact on the Partnership's operations and growth plans, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs and prevent development within originally anticipated time frames. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's financial condition and results of operations.The Partnership must continually compete for crude oil, condensate and natural gas supplies, and any decrease in supplies of such commodities could adversely affect the Partnership's financial condition and results of operations.In order to maintain or increase throughput levels in the Partnership's natural gas gathering systems and asset utilization rates at its processing plants and to fulfill its current sales commitments, the Partnership must continually contract for new product supplies. The Partnership may not be able to obtain additional contracts for crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGL supplies. The primary factors affecting the Partnership's ability to connect new wells to its gathering facilities include the Partnership's success in contracting for existing supplies that are not committed to other systems and the level of drilling activity near its gathering systems. If the Partnership is unable to maintain or increase the volumes on its systems by accessing new supplies to offset the natural decline in reserves, the Partnership's business and financial results could be materially, adversely affected. In addition, the Partnership's future growth will depend in part upon whether it can contract for additional supplies at a greater rate than the rate of natural decline in its current supplies.Fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new crude oil, condensate and natural gas reserves. During 2015, the Partnership has seen a decline in drilling activity due to low commodity prices. Although drilling activity has already slowed, if the current period of low commodity prices continues, we would expect additional downward pressure on future drilling activity, which may result in lower volumes. Tax policy changes or additional regulatory restrictions on development could also have a negative impact on drilling activity, reducing supplies of product available to the Partnership's systems and assets. Additional governmental regulation of, or delays in issuance of permits for, the offshore exploration and production industry may negatively impact current and future volumes from offshore pipelines supplying the Partnership's processing plants. The Partnership has no control over producers and depends on them to maintain sufficient levels of drilling activity. A continued decrease in the level of drilling activity or a material decrease in production in the Partnership's principal geographic areas for a prolonged period, as a result of continued depressed commodity prices or otherwise, likely would have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's results of operations and financial position.Any decrease in the volumes that the Partnership gathers, processes, fractionates or transports would adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Partnership's financial performance depends to a large extent on the volumes of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs gathered, processed, fractionated and transported on its assets. Decreases in the volumes of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs we gather, process, fractionate or transport would directly and adversely affect the Partnership's revenues and results of operations. These volumes can be influenced by factors beyond the Partnership's control, including:•environmental or other governmental regulations;•weather conditions;•increases in storage levels of natural gas and NGLs;•increased use of alternative energy sources;•decreased demand for natural gas and NGLs;•continued fluctuations in commodity prices, including the prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate;•economic conditions;•supply disruptions;•availability of supply connected to the Partnership's systems; and•availability and adequacy of infrastructure to gather and process supply into and out of the Partnership's systems.36The volumes of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs gathered, processed, fractionated and transported on the Partnership's assets also depend on the production from the regions that supply its systems. Supply of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs can be affected by many of the factors listed above, including commodity prices and weather. In order to maintain or increase throughput levels on the Partnership's systems, the Partnership must obtain new sources of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. The primary factors affecting the Partnership's ability to obtain non-dedicated sources of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs include (i) the level of successful leasing, permitting and drilling activity in the Partnership's areas of operation, (ii) the Partnership's ability to compete for volumes from new wells and (iii) the Partnership's ability to compete successfully for volumes from sources connected to other pipelines. The Partnership has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operation, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to its systems or the rate at which production from a well declines. In addition, the Partnership has no control over producers or its drilling or production decisions, which are affected by, among other things, the availability and cost of capital, levels of reserves, availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipment.An impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets and equity method investments could reduce our earnings. GAAP requires us to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the investments the Partnership accounts for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of the unconsolidated affiliate investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. If we determine that an impairment is indicated, we would be required to take an immediate non-cash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $223.1 million impairment of intangible assets in our Crude and Condensate segment and a goodwill impairment totaling $1,328.2 million in our Texas, Louisiana and Crude and Condensate segments, primarily as a result of the further decline in commodity prices and the public trading price of the Partnership's common units. We could experience future events that result in impairments. Additional impairment of the value of our existing goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results.The Partnership's construction of new assets may not result in revenue increases and may be subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which could adversely affect the Partnership's cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.The construction of additions or modifications to the Partnership's existing systems and the construction of new midstream assets involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties beyond its control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. Financing may not be available on economically acceptable terms or at all. If the Partnership undertakes these projects, it may not be able to complete them on schedule, at the budgeted cost or at all. Moreover, the Partnership's revenues may not increase due to the successful construction of a particular project. For instance, if the Partnership expands a pipeline or constructs a new pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and it may not receive any material increases in revenues promptly following completion of a project or at all. Moreover, the Partnership may construct facilities to capture anticipated future production growth in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve its expected investment return, which could adversely affect the Partnership's results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the construction of additions to the Partnership's existing gathering and processing assets will generally require it to obtain new rights-of-way and permits prior to constructing new pipelines or facilities. The Partnership may be unable to timely obtain such rights-of-way or permits to connect new product supplies to its existing gathering lines or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive for the Partnership to obtain new rights-of-way or to expand or renew existing rights-of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, the Partnership's cash flows could be adversely affected.Construction of the Partnership's major development projects subjects it to risks of construction delays, cost over-runs, limitations on its growth and negative effects on its operating results, liquidity and financial condition.The Partnership is engaged in the planning and construction of several major development projects, some of which will take a number of months before commercial operation. These projects are complex and subject to a number of factors beyond the Partnership's control, including delays from third-party landowners, the permitting process, complying with laws, unavailability of materials, labor disruptions, environmental hazards, financing, accidents, weather and other factors. Any delay in the completion of these projects could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. The construction of pipelines and gathering and processing and fractionation facilities requires the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed the Partnership's estimated costs. Estimating the timing and expenditures related to these development projects is very complex and subject to variables that can significantly 37increase expected costs. Should the actual costs of these projects exceed the Partnership's estimates, its liquidity and capital position could be adversely affected. This level of development activity requires significant effort from the Partnership's management and technical personnel and places additional requirements on its financial resources and internal financial controls. The Partnership may not have the ability to attract and/or retain the necessary number of personnel with the skills required to bring complicated projects to successful conclusions.Any reductions in the Partnership's credit ratings could increase its financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships. The Partnership cannot assure you that its credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. On February 2, 2016, S&P downgraded the Partnership to a BBB- credit rating, and the Partnership’s credit rating is currently under review by Moody’s Investors Service. Any future downgrade could increase the cost of borrowings under the Partnership's credit facility. Any downgrade could also lead to higher borrowing costs and, if below investment grade, could require:•additional or more restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on the Partnership and its subsidiaries;•the Partnership's subsidiaries to guarantee such debt and certain existing debt, including its senior notes;•the Partnership and its subsidiaries to provide collateral to secure such debt; and•the Partnership or its subsidiaries to post cash collateral or letters of credit under its hedging arrangements or in order to purchase commodities or obtain trade credit. Any increase in the Partnership's financing costs or additional or more restrictive covenants resulting from a credit rating downgrade could adversely affect its ability to finance future operations and make cash distributions to unitholders. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant collateral requirement were to occur at a time when the Partnership were experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholders could be adversely affected.The Partnership typically does not obtain independent evaluations of hydrocarbon reserves; therefore, volumes the Partnership service in the future could be less than anticipated.The Partnership typically does not obtain, on a regular basis, independent evaluations of hydrocarbon reserves connected to its gathering systems or that it otherwise services due to the unwillingness of producers to provide reserve information as well as the cost of such evaluations. Accordingly, the Partnership does not have independent estimates of total reserves serviced by its assets or the anticipated life of such reserves. If the total reserves or estimated life of the reserves is less than the Partnership anticipates and it is unable to secure additional sources, then the volumes transported on the Partnership's gathering systems or that it otherwise services in the future could be less than anticipated. A decline in the volumes could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.The Partnership may not be successful in balancing its purchases and sales.The Partnership is a party to certain long-term gas, NGL and condensate sales commitments that it satisfies through supplies purchased under long-term gas, NGL and condensate purchase agreements. When the Partnership enters into those arrangements, its sales obligations generally match its purchase obligations. However, over time the supplies that the Partnership has under contract may decline due to reduced drilling or other causes and the Partnership may be required to satisfy the sales obligations by purchasing additional gas at prices that may exceed the prices received under the sales commitments. In addition, a producer could fail to deliver contracted volumes or deliver in excess of contracted volumes, or a consumer could purchase more or less than contracted volumes. Any of these actions could cause the Partnership's purchases and sales not to be balanced. If the Partnership's purchases and sales are not balanced, it will face increased exposure to commodity price risks and could have increased volatility in its operating income.The Partnership have made commitments to purchase natural gas in production areas based on production-area indices and to sell the natural gas into market areas based on market-area indices, pay the costs to transport the natural gas between the two points and capture the difference between the indices as margin. Changes in the index prices relative to each other (also referred to as basis spread) can significantly affect the Partnership's margins or even result in losses. For example, the Partnership is a party to one contract with a term to 2019 to supply approximately 150,000 MMBtu/d of gas. The Partnership buys gas for this contract on several different production-area indices on its NTPL and sell the gas into a different market area index. The Partnership realizes a loss on the delivery of gas under this contract each month based on current prices. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 reflects a liability of $62.8 million related to this performance obligation based on forecasted discounted cash obligations in excess of market under this gas delivery contract. Reduced supplies and narrower basis spreads in recent periods have increased the losses on this contract, and greater losses on this contract could occur in future periods if these conditions persist or become worse.38The Partnership's profitability is dependent upon prices and market demand for oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs, which are beyond its control and have been volatile. The current depressed commodity price environment, if it continues, could result in financial losses and reduce the Partnership's cash available for distribution.The Partnership is subject to significant risks due to fluctuations in commodity prices. The Partnership is directly exposed to these risks primarily in the gas processing and NGL fractionation components of its business. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 2.8% of the Partnership's total gross operating margin was generated under percent of liquids contracts and percent of proceeds contracts. Under percent of liquids contracts the Partnership receives a fee in the form of a percentage of the liquids recovered and the producer bears all the cost of the natural gas shrink. Accordingly, the Partnership's revenues under percent of liquids contracts are directly impacted by the market price of NGLs. Gross operating margin results under percent of proceeds contracts are impacted only by the value of the natural gas or liquids produced with margins higher during periods of higher natural gas and liquids prices.The Partnership also realizes processing gross operating margins under processing margin contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 0.7% of the Partnership's total gross operating margin was generated under processing margin contracts. The Partnership has a number of processing margin contracts for activities at its Plaquemine and Pelican processing plants. Under this type of contract, the Partnership pays the producer for the full amount of inlet gas to the plant, and it makes a margin based on the difference between the value of liquids recovered from the processed natural gas as compared to the value of the natural gas volumes lost (“shrink”) and the cost of fuel used in processing. The shrink and fuel losses are referred to as plant thermal reduction (“PTR”). The Partnership’s margins from these contracts can be greatly reduced or eliminated during periods of high natural gas prices relative to liquids prices. The Partnership is also indirectly exposed to commodity prices due to the negative impacts on production and the development of production of oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs connected to or near its assets and on its margins for transportation between certain market centers. Low prices for these products have reduced the demand for the Partnership's services and volumes on its systems, and continued low prices may reduce such demand even further.Although the majority of the Partnership's NGL fractionation business is under fee-based arrangements, a portion of its business is exposed to commodity price risk because it realizes a margin due to product upgrades associated with its Cajun-Sibon fractionation business. For the year ended December 31, 2015, margins realized associated with product upgrades represented less than 1% of the Partnership's gross operating margin.The prices of crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs have been extremely volatile. Crude oil, weighted average NGL, and natural gas prices declined 30%, 18% and 26%, respectively from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015. We expect this volatility to continue. For example, crude oil prices (based on the NYMEX futures daily close prices for the prompt month) in 2015 ranged from a high of $61.43 per Bbl in June 2015 to a low of $34.73 per Bbl in December 2015. Weighted average NGL prices in 2015 (based on the Oil Price Information Service (“OPIS”) Napoleonville daily average spot liquids prices) ranged from a high of $0.56 per gallon in March 2015 to a low of $0.37 per gallon in December 2015. Natural gas prices (based on Gas Daily Henry Hub closing prices) during 2015 ranged from a high of $3.23 per MMBtu in January 2015 to a low of $1.76 per MMBtu in December 2015.The markets and prices for crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs depend upon factors beyond the Partnership's control that make it difficult to predict future commodity price movements with any certainty. These factors include the supply and demand for crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs, which fluctuate with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including:•the impact of weather on the demand for crude oil and natural gas;•the level of domestic crude oil, condensate and natural gas production;•technology, including improved production techniques (particularly with respect to shale development);•the level of domestic industrial and manufacturing activity;•the availability of imported crude oil, natural gas and NGLs;•international demand for crude oil and NGLs;•actions taken by foreign crude oil and gas producing nations;•the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military action and civil unrest;•the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems;•the availability of downstream NGL fractionation facilities;•the availability and marketing of competitive fuels;•the impact of energy conservation efforts; and39•the extent of governmental regulation and taxation, including the regulation of hydraulic fracturing and “greenhouse gases.”Changes in commodity prices also indirectly impact our profitability by influencing drilling activity and well operations, and thus the volume of gas, crude oil and condensate we gather and process and NGLs we fractionate. The volatility in commodity prices may cause the Partnership's gross operating margin and cash flows to vary widely from period to period. The Partnership’s hedging strategies may not be sufficient to offset price volatility risk and, in any event, do not cover all of the Partnership's throughput volumes. Moreover, hedges are subject to inherent risks, which we describe in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk.” The Partnership’s use of derivative financial instruments does not eliminate the Partnership's exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates and has in the past and could in the future result in financial losses or reduce our income.If third-party pipelines or other midstream facilities interconnected to our gathering or transportation systems become partially or fully unavailable, or if the volumes we gather, process or transport do not meet the quality requirements of the pipelines or facilities to which the Partnership connects, the Partnership's gross operating margin and cash flow could be adversely affected.The Partnership's gathering, processing and transportation assets connect to other pipelines or facilities owned and operated by unaffiliated third parties. The continuing operation of, and the Partnership's continuing access to, such third-party pipelines, processing facilities and other midstream facilities is not within the Partnership's control. These pipelines, plants and other midstream facilities may become unavailable because of testing, turnarounds, line repair, maintenance, reduced operating pressure, lack of operating capacity, regulatory requirements and curtailments of receipt or deliveries due to insufficient capacity or because of damage from severe weather conditions or other operational issues. In addition, if the Partnership's costs to access and transport on these third-party pipelines significantly increase, the Partnership's profitability could be reduced. If any such increase in costs occurs, if any of these pipelines or other midstream facilities become unable to receive, transport or process product, or if the volumes the Partnership gathers or transports does not meet the product quality requirements of such pipelines or facilities, the Partnership's operating margin and cash flow could be adversely affected.The Partnership’s debt levels could limit our flexibility and adversely affect its financial health or limit its flexibility to obtain financing and to pursue other business opportunities.The Partnership continues to have the ability to incur debt, subject to limitations in its credit facility. The Partnership’s level of indebtedness could have important consequences to it, including the following:•the Partnership’s ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;•the Partnership’s funds available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions to unitholders will be reduced by that portion of the Partnership’s cash flows required to make interest payments on its debt;•the Partnership’s debt level will make it more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; •limit the Partnership’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it operates; and•increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations.In addition, the Partnership’s ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations depends on its successful financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions, many of which are beyond the Partnership’s control. If the Partnership’s cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations, the Partnership may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying its business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing its debt or seeking additional equity capital. The Partnership may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all.The terms of the Partnership's credit facility and indentures may restrict its current and future operations, particularly its ability to respond to changes in business or to take certain actions. The Partnership's credit agreement and the indentures governing its senior notes contain, and any future indebtedness it incurs will likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on the Partnership's ability to engage in acts that may be in its best long-term interest. One or more of these agreements include covenants that, among other things, restrict the Partnership's ability to:•incur subsidiary indebtedness;•engage in transactions with its affiliates;•consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of its assets;•incur liens;40•enter into sale and lease back transactions; and•change business activities it conducts.In addition, the Partnership's credit facility requires it to satisfy and maintain a specified financial ratio. The Partnership's ability to meet that financial ratio can be affected by events beyond its control, and the Partnership cannot assure you that it will continue to meet that ratio.The Partnership's ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit facility and indentures may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, the Partnership's ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under its credit facility and indentures. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, all amounts outstanding under the applicable debt agreements could be declared to be immediately due and payable and all applicable commitments to extend further credit could be terminated. If indebtedness under the Partnership's credit facility or indentures is accelerated, there can be no assurance that it will have sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in these debt agreements and any future financing agreements may adversely affect the Partnership's ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.Increases in interest rates could adversely impact the price of the Partnership's common units, its ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and its ability to make cash distributions at its intended levels.Interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing the Partnership's financing costs to increase accordingly. As with other yield-oriented securities, the Partnership's unit price is impacted by its level of cash distributions and implied distribution yield. The distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in the Partnership's units, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on the price of its common units, its ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and its ability to make cash distributions at its intended levels.The Partnership is vulnerable to operational, regulatory and other risks due to its significant assets in south Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico, including the effects of adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes.The Partnership's operations and revenues will be significantly impacted by conditions in south Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico because the Partnership significant assets located in these two areas. The Partnership's concentration of activity in Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico makes the Partnership more vulnerable than many of its competitors to the risks associated with these areas, including:•adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms;•delays or decreases in production, the availability of equipment, facilities or services; and•changes in the regulatory environment.Because a significant portion of the Partnership's operations could experience the same condition at the same time, these conditions could have a relatively greater impact on the Partnership's results of operations than they might have on other midstream companies that have operations in more diversified geographic areas.A reduction in demand for NGL products by the petrochemical, refining or other industries or by the fuel markets could materially adversely affect the Partnership's results of operations and financial condition.The NGL products the Partnership produces has a variety of applications, including as heating fuels, petrochemical feedstocks and refining blend stocks. A reduction in demand for NGL products, whether because of general or industry specific economic conditions, new government regulations, global competition, reduced demand by consumers for products made with NGL products (for example, reduced petrochemical demand observed due to lower activity in the automobile and construction industries), increased competition from petroleum-based feedstocks due to pricing differences, mild winter weather for some NGL applications or other reasons could result in a decline in the volume of NGL products the Partnership handles or reduce the fees the Partnership charges for its services. The Partnership's NGL products and the demand for these products are affected as follows:•Ethane. Ethane is typically supplied as purity ethane or as part of ethane-propane mix. Ethane is primarily used in the petrochemical industry as feedstock for ethylene, one of the basic building blocks for a wide range of plastics and other chemical products. Although ethane is typically extracted as part of the mixed NGL stream at gas processing plants, if natural gas prices increase significantly in relation to NGL product prices or if the demand for ethylene falls, it may be more profitable for natural gas processors to leave the ethane in the natural gas stream. Such "ethane rejection," which the Partnership has experienced in greater volumes recently, reduces the volume of NGLs delivered for fractionation and marketing.41•Propane. Propane is used as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene and propylene, as a heating, engine and industrial fuel, and in agricultural applications such as crop drying. Changes in demand for ethylene and propylene could adversely affect demand for propane. The demand for propane as a heating fuel is significantly affected by weather conditions. The volume of propane sold is at its highest during the six-month peak heating season of October through March. Demand for the Partnership's propane may be reduced during periods of warmer-than-normal weather.•Normal Butane. Normal butane is used in the production of isobutane, as a refined product blending component, as a fuel gas, and in the production of ethylene and propylene. Changes in the composition of refined products resulting from governmental regulation, changes in feedstocks, products and economics, demand for heating fuel and for ethylene and propylene could adversely affect demand for normal butane.•Isobutane. Isobutane is predominantly used in refineries to produce alkylates to enhance octane levels. Accordingly, any action that reduces demand for motor gasoline or demand for isobutane to produce alkylates for octane enhancement might reduce demand for isobutane.•Natural Gasoline. Natural gasoline is used as a blending component for certain refined products and as a feedstock used in the production of ethylene and propylene. Changes in the mandated composition resulting from governmental regulation of motor gasoline and in demand for ethylene and propylene could adversely affect demand for natural gasoline.NGLs and products produced from NGLs are sold in competitive global markets. Any reduced demand for ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane or natural gasoline in the markets we access for any of the reasons stated above could adversely affect demand for the services the Partnership provides as well as NGL prices, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.The Partnership expects to encounter significant competition in any new geographic areas into which it seeks to expand, and the Partnership's ability to enter such markets may be limited.If the Partnership expands its operations into new geographic areas, the Partnership expects to encounter significant competition for natural gas, condensate, NGLs and crude oil supplies and markets. Competitors in these new markets will include companies larger than the Partnership, which have both lower cost of capital and greater geographic coverage, as well as smaller companies, which have lower total cost structures. As a result, the Partnership may not be able to successfully develop acquired assets and markets located in new geographic areas and its results of operations could be adversely affected.The Partnership does not own most of the land on which its pipelines and compression facilities are located, which could disrupt its operations.The Partnership does not own most of the land on which its pipelines and compression facilities are located, and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way or leases or if such rights-of-way or leases lapse or terminate. The Partnership sometimes obtains the rights to land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. The Partnership's loss of these rights, through its inability to renew right-of-way contracts, leases or otherwise, could cause it to cease operations on the affected land, increase costs related to continuing operations elsewhere and reduce its revenue.The Partnership offers pipeline, truck, rail and barge services. Significant delays, inclement weather or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect the Partnership's operations and earnings.The Partnership offers pipeline, truck, rail and barge services. The costs of conducting these services could be negatively affected by factors outside of the Partnership's control, including rail service interruptions, new laws and regulations, rate increases, tariffs, rising fuel costs or capacity constraints. Inclement weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes, snow, ice and other weather events, can negatively impact the Partnership's distribution network. In addition, rail, truck or barge accidents involving the transportation of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property damage and environmental penalties and remediation.The Partnership could experience increased severity or frequency of trucking accidents and other claims.Potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or workers’ compensation claims or the unfavorable development of existing claims could materially adversely affect the Partnership's results of operations. In the event that accidents occur, the Partnership may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and its insurance may be inadequate in certain cases. The occurrence of an event not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure or inability of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses.42Changes in trucking regulations may increase the Partnership's costs and negatively impact its results of operations.The Partnership's trucking services are subject to regulation as motor carriers by the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and by various state agencies, whose regulations include certain permit requirements of state highway and safety authorities. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers over the Partnership's trucking operations, generally governing such matters as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety, equipment testing and specifications and insurance requirements. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may impact the Partnership's operations and affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for or the cost of providing trucking services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent fuel emission limits, changes in the regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period, limits on vehicle weight and size and other matters, including safety requirements.If the Partnership does not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or efficiently and effectively integrate the acquired assets with its asset base, its future growth will be limited.The Partnership's ability to grow depends, in part, on its ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in cash generated from operations on a per unit basis. If the Partnership is unable to make accretive acquisitions either because it is (1) unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them, (2) unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or at all or (3) outbid by competitors, then its future growth and ability to increase distributions will be limited.From time to time, the Partnership may evaluate and seek to acquire assets or businesses that it believes complement its existing business and related assets. The Partnership may acquire assets or businesses that it plans to use in a manner materially different from its prior owner’s use. Any acquisition involves potential risks, including:•the inability to integrate the operations of recently acquired businesses or assets, especially if the assets acquired are in a new business segment or geographic area;•the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;•the failure to realize expected volumes, revenues, profitability or growth;•the failure to realize any expected synergies and cost savings;•the coordination of geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities;•the assumption of unknown liabilities;•the loss of customers or key employees from the acquired businesses;•a significant increase in the Partnership's indebtedness; and•potential environmental or regulatory liabilities and title problems.Management’s assessment of these risks is inexact and may not reveal or resolve all existing or potential problems associated with an acquisition. Realization of any of these risks could adversely affect the Partnership's operations and cash flows. If the Partnership consummates any future acquisition, its capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and you will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that the Partnership will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources.The Partnership may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers, which would reduce its revenues and limit its future profitability.The renewal or replacement of existing contracts with the Partnership customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond the Partnership's control, including competition from other midstream service providers, and the price of, and demand for, crude oil, condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the markets it serves. The inability of the Partnership's management to renew or replace the Partnership's current contracts as they expire and to respond appropriately to changing market conditions could have a negative effect on the Partnership's profitability.In particular, the Partnership's ability to renew or replace its existing contracts with industrial end-users and utilities impacts our profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 50.4% of the Partnership's sales of gas transported using the Partnership's physical facilities were to industrial end-users and utilities. As a consequence of the increase in competition in the industry and volatility of natural gas prices, end-users and utilities may be reluctant to enter into long-term purchase contracts. Many end-users purchase natural gas from more than one natural gas company and have the ability to change providers at any time. Some of these end-users also have the ability to switch between gas and alternate fuels in response to relative price fluctuations in the market. Because there are numerous companies of greatly varying size and financial capacity that compete with the Partnership in marketing natural gas, the Partnership often competes in the end-user and utilities markets primarily on the basis of price.43The Partnership is exposed to the credit risk of its customers and counterparties, and a general increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by its customers could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.Risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by the Partnership's customers are a major concern in its business. The Partnership is subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers and other counterparties, such as its lenders and hedging counterparties. Any increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by the Partnership's customers could adversely affect its results of operations and reduce its ability to make distributions to us. Additionally, many of the Partnership's customers' equity values have substantially declined. The combination of a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in the Partnership's customers' liquidity and ability to make payment or perform on its obligations to the Partnership. Furthermore, some of the Partnership's customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks,which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to the Partnership.Increased federal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives, as well as government reviews relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and reductions or delays in natural gas production by the Partnership’s customers, which could adversely impact its revenues.A portion of the Partnership's suppliers’ and customers’ natural gas production is developed from unconventional sources, such as deep gas shales, that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate gas production. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. In addition, certain federal agencies have proposed additional laws and regulations to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, in August 2015, the EPA proposed updates to new source performance standard requirements that would impose more stringent controls on methane, a GHG, and volatile organic compounds emissions from oil and gas development and production operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity. Congress from time to time has considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local governments have also adopted and may seek to adopt further ordinances regulating, within their jurisdictions, the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular, in some cases banning hydraulic fracturing entirely. For example, Oklahoma, Texas, and many other states have imposed regulations regarding disclosure of information regarding chemicals in well stimulation operations. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the EPA, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing such as the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater.State and federal regulatory agencies also have recently focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste waters produced by fracking and an observed increase in minor seismic activity and tremors. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In a few instances, operators of injection wells in the vicinity of minor seismic events have reduced injection volumes or suspended operations, often voluntarily, and some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. For example, the TRRC rules allow the TRRC to modify, suspend, or terminate a permit based on a determination that the permitted activity is likely to be contributing to seismic activity. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission has also taken steps to focus on induced seismicity, including increasing the frequency of required recordkeeping for wells that dispose into certain formations and considering seismic information in permitting decisions. As regulatory agencies continue to study induced seismicity, such agencies may promulgate additional regulations, which could affect natural gas production by the Partnership's customers and could directly affect the Partnership's brine disposal operations.We cannot predict whether any additional legislation or regulations will be enacted and, if so, what the provisions would be. If additional levels of regulation and permits were required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level, that could lead to delays, increased operating costs and process prohibitions for the Partnership's suppliers and customers that could reduce the volumes of natural gas that move through the Partnership's gathering systems which could materially adversely affect its revenue and results of operations.Transportation on certain of the Partnership's natural gas pipelines is subject to federal and state rate and service regulation, which could limit the revenues the Partnership collects from its customers and adversely affect the cash available for distribution to us. The imposition of regulation on the Partnership's currently unregulated natural gas pipelines also could increase its operating costs and adversely affect the cash available for distribution to us.The rates, terms and conditions of service under which the Partnership transports natural gas in its pipeline systems in interstate commerce are subject to regulation of FERC under the NGA and under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act and the rules and regulations promulgated under those statutes. Under the NGA, FERC regulation requires that interstate natural gas 44pipeline rates be filed with FERC and that these rates be “just and reasonable” and not unduly discriminatory, although negotiated or settlement rates may be accepted in certain circumstances. Interested persons may challenge proposed new or changed rates, and FERC is authorized to suspend the effectiveness of such rates pending an investigation or hearing. FERC may also investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a pipeline to change its rates prospectively. Accordingly, action by FERC could adversely affect the Partnership's ability to establish reasonable rates that cover operating costs and allow for a reasonable return. An adverse determination in any future rate proceeding brought by or against the Partnership could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash available for distribution. Under the NGPA, the Partnership is required to justify its rates for interstate transportation service on a cost-of-service basis every five years. The Partnership's intrastate natural gas pipeline operations are subject to regulation by various agencies of the states in which they are located. Should FERC or any of these state agencies determine that the Partnership's rates for Section 311 transportation service or intrastate transportation service should be lowered, the Partnership's business could be adversely affected.The Partnership's natural gas gathering and processing activities generally are exempt from FERC regulation under the Natural Gas Act. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of substantial, ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of the Partnership's gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC and the courts. Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels since FERC has less extensively regulated the gathering activities of interstate pipeline transmission companies and a number of such companies have transferred gathering facilities to unregulated affiliates. The Partnership's gathering operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of gathering facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on the Partnership's operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.If the Partnership fails to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, it could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. Under the EPAct 2005, FERC has civil penalty authority to impose penalties for current violations of the NGA or NGPA of up to $1.0 million per day for each violation. FERC also has the power to order disgorgement of profits from transactions deemed to violate the NGA and EPAct 2005.Other state and local regulations also affect the Partnership's business. The Partnership is subject to some ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states where it operates. Ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes have the effect of restricting the Partnership's rights as owners of gathering facilities to decide with whom the Partnership contract to purchase or transport natural gas. Federal law leaves any economic regulation of natural gas gathering to the states, and some of the states in which the Partnership operates have adopted complaint-based or other limited economic regulation of natural gas gathering activities. States in which we operate that have adopted some form of complaint-based regulation, like Texas, generally allow natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering access and rate discrimination.Transportation on the Partnership’s liquids pipelines is subject to federal rate and state and service regulation, which could limit the revenues the Partnership collects from its customers and adversely affect the cash available for distribution to us.The Partnership’s liquids transportation pipelines in the ORV and the VEX and Cajun-Sibon pipeline are subject to regulation by FERC under the ICA, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates and terms and conditions of service for interstate service on liquids pipelines be just, reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. The ICA also requires that such rates and terms and conditions be set forth in tariffs filed with FERC. The ICA permits interested persons to challenge proposed new or changed rates and authorizes FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for up to seven months and investigate such rates. If, upon completion of an investigation, FERC finds that the new or changed rates are unlawful, it is authorized to require the pipeline to refund revenues collected in excess of the just and reasonable rates during the term of the investigation. FERC may also investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively. Under certain circumstances, FERC could limit the Partnership’s ability to set rates based on its costs or could order the Partnership to reduce its rates and could require the payment of reparations to complaining shippers for up to two years prior to the date of the complaint. FERC also has the authority to change the Partnership’s terms and conditions of service if it determines that they are unjust and unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential.As the Partnership acquires, constructs and operates new liquids assets and expands its liquids transportation business, the classification and regulation of its liquids transportation services are subject to ongoing assessment and change based on the 45services it provides and determinations by FERC and the courts. Such changes may subject additional services we provide to regulation by FERC, which could increase the Partnership's operating costs, decrease its rates and adversely affect its business.The Partnership may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from compliance with pipeline safety regulations.The states in which the Partnership conducts operations administer federal pipeline safety standards under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968. These standards only apply to certain natural gas gathering lines based on the gathering line’s operating pressure and proximity to people. Because of their pressure and location, substantial portions of the Partnership's gathering facilities are not regulated under that statute. The gathering line exemptions, however, may be revised in the future and place more of the Partnership's gathering facilities under jurisdiction of the DOT. Nonetheless, the Partnership's natural gas transmission pipelines are subject to regulation by the DOT. In response to pipeline accidents in other parts of the country, Congress and the DOT, through PHMSA, have passed or are considering heightened pipeline safety requirements that may be applicable to gathering lines. As a result, the Partnership's pipeline facilities are subject to the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, which reauthorized funding for federal safety programs through 2015, increased penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines.At the state level, several states have passed legislation or promulgated rulemaking addressing pipeline safety. Compliance with these laws and rules could result in substantial expenditures for testing, repairs and replacement. For example, TRRC regulations require periodic testing of all intrastate pipelines meeting certain size and location requirements. The Partnership's costs relating to compliance with the required testing under the TRRC regulations were approximately at $3.3 million, $2.5 million, and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We expect the costs for compliance with TRRC and DOT regulations to be approximately $3.6 million during 2016. If the Partnership's pipelines fail to meet the safety standards mandated by the TRRC or the DOT regulations, then it may be required to repair or replace sections of such pipelines or operate the pipelines at a reduced maximum allowable operating pressure, the cost of which cannot be estimated at this time.In addition, the Partnership's liquids transportation pipelines are subject to regulation by the DOT, through the PHMSA, pursuant to the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended by the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, and reauthorized and amended by the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006. PHMSA has adopted regulations requiring hazardous liquid pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for pipeline segments that, in the event of a leak or rupture, could affect “high consequence areas,” such as high population areas, areas that are sources of drinking water, ecological resource areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage from a pipeline release and commercially navigable waterways, unless the operator effectively demonstrates by risk assessment that the pipeline could not affect the area.Due to the possibility of new or amended laws and regulations or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that future compliance with the PHMSA or state requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial positions. As the Partnership's operations continue to expand into and around urban or more populated areas, such as the Barnett Shale, the Partnership may incur additional expenses to mitigate noise, odor and light that may be emitted in its operations and expenses related to the appearance of its facilities. Municipal and other local or state regulations are imposing various obligations including, among other things, regulating the location of Partnership facilities, imposing limitations on the noise levels of its facilities and requiring certain other improvements that increase the cost of our facilities. The Partnership is also subject to claims by neighboring landowners for nuisance related to the construction and operation of the Partnership's facilities, which could subject it to damages for declines in neighboring property values due to its construction and operation of facilities.Failure to comply with existing or new environmental laws or regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or wastes into the environment may cause the Partnership to incur significant costs and liabilities.Many of the operations and activities of our gathering systems, processing plants, fractionators, brine disposal operations and other facilities are subject to significant federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. The obligations imposed by these laws and regulations include obligations related to air emissions and discharge of pollutants from the Partnership's facilities and the cleanup of hazardous substances and other wastes that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by the Partnership or locations to which it has sent wastes for treatment or disposal. Various governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, and violators are subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including civil fines, injunctions or both. Strict, joint and several liability may be incurred under these laws and regulations for the remediation of contaminated areas. Private parties, including the owners of properties near the Partnership's facilities or upon or through which its gathering systems traverse, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations for releases of contaminants or for personal injury or property damage.46There is inherent risk of the incurrence of significant environmental costs and liabilities in the Partnership's business due to its handling of natural gas, crude oil and other petroleum substances, the Partnership’s brine disposal operations, air emissions related to the Partnership's operations, historical industry operations, waste disposal practices and the prior use of natural gas flow meters containing mercury. For example, the Partnership operates brine disposal wells in Ohio and West Virginia and may gather brine from surrounding states. These wells are regulated under the SDWA as Class II wells and under state laws. State laws and regulations that govern these operations can be more stringent than the SDWA, such as the Ohio Department of Natural Resources rules which in 2012, imposed new, more stringent environmentally responsible standards for the permitting and operating of brine disposal wells, including extensive review of geologic data and use of state of the art technology. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources also regulates the transportation and disposal of brine. In addition, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. The Partnership may incur material environmental costs and liabilities. Furthermore, the Partnership's insurance may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against it.State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste waters and an observed increase in minor seismic activity and tremors. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Regulatory agencies are continuing to study possible linkage between injection activity and induced seismicity. To the extent these studies result in additional regulation of injection wells, such regulations could impose additional regulations, costs and restrictions on the Partnership’s brine disposal operations.The Partnership's business may be adversely affected by increased costs due to stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from non-compliance with required operating or other regulatory permits. New environmental laws or regulations, including, for example, legislation relating to the control of greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing environmental laws or regulations might adversely affect the Partnership's operations, including its processing, storage or transportation activities, as well as, waste management or air emissions might adversely affect its business and its profitability. Federal and state agencies could also impose additional safety requirements, any of which could affect the Partnership's profitability. Recent rules under the Clean Air Act imposing more stringent requirements on the oil and gas industry could cause the Partnership and its customers to incur increased capital expenditures and operating costs as well as reduce the demand for the Partnership's services.On April 17, 2012, the EPA approved final rules under the Clean Air Act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production, pipelines and processing operations. These rules became effective on October 15, 2012. Among other things, these rules require additional emissions controls for natural gas and NGLs production, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and VOCs and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with such production activities. The final regulations require, among other things, the reduction of VOC emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. Moreover, these rules establish specific requirements regarding emissions from compressors and controllers at natural gas gathering and boosting stations and processing plants together with dehydrators and storage tanks at natural gas processing plants, compressor stations and gathering and boosting stations. The rules also establish new requirements for leak detection and repair of leaks at natural gas processing plants that exceed 500 parts per million in concentration. These rules required a number of modifications to the Partnership's assets and operations and could require additional modifications both to its and to its natural gas exploration and production suppliers’ and customers’ operations, including the installation of new equipment, which could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs. The incurrence of such expenditures and costs by the Partnership's suppliers and customers could result in reduced production by those suppliers and customers and thus translate into reduced demand for the Partnership's services. Responding to rule challenges, the EPA has since revised certain aspects of its April 2012 rules and has indicated that it may reconsider other aspects of the rules. In addition, in August 2015, the EPA proposed updates to new source performance standard requirements that would impose more stringent controls on methane, a GHG, and volatile organic compounds emissions from oil and gas development and production operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity. The Partnership cannot predict the costs of compliance with any modified or newly issued rules.Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the natural gas and NGL services the Partnership provides.The United States Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. In 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the adoption of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement will be open for signing on April 22, 2016 and will require countries to review and “represent a progression” in 47their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. Following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting requirements to include upstream petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalent per year. These permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of GHGs by the EPA. Furthermore, in August 2015, the EPA proposed changes to its regulations imposing more stringent controls on methane, a GHG, and volatile organic compounds emissions from oil and gas development and production operations. A final rule is expected in 2016. The Administration has also announced that other federal agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management, the PHMSA, and the Department of Energy will impose new or more stringent regulations on the oil and gas sector that will have the effect of reducing methane emissions.In addition, almost half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and NGL fractionation plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. The adoption of legislation or regulations imposing reporting or permitting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, the Partnership's equipment and operations could require the Partnership to incur additional costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with its operations, could adversely affect its performance of operations in the absence of any permits that may be required to regulate emission of GHGs or could adversely affect demand for the natural gas the Partnership gathers, processes or otherwise handles in connection with its services.The Endangered Species Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act govern our operations and additional restrictions may be imposed in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our operations.The ESA and analogous state laws restrict activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the MBTA. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and state agencies may designate critical or suitable habitat areas that they believe are necessary for the survival of threatened or endangered species. Such a designation could materially restrict use of or access to federal, state and private lands. Some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species or that may attract migratory birds. In these areas, the Partnership may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse impacts to protected species, and it may be prohibited from conducting operations in certain locations or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when its operations could have an adverse effect on the species. It is also possible that a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to the Partnership's activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species. In addition, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and state agencies regularly review species that are listing candidates, and designations of additional endangered or threatened species, or critical or suitable habitat, under the ESA could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas.The Partnership's business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. The occurrence of a significant accident or other event that is not fully insured could adversely affect the Partnership's operations and financial condition.The Partnership’s operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the gathering, compressing, processing, transporting, fractionating, disposing and storage of natural gas, NGLs, condensate, crude oil and brine, including:•damage to pipelines, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, floods, fires and other natural disasters and acts of terrorism;•inadvertent damage from construction and farm equipment;•leaks of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, condensate and other hydrocarbons;•induced seismicity;•rail accidents, barge accidents and truck accidents; and•fires and explosions.These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in curtailment or suspension of the Partnership's related operations. The Partnership is not fully insured against all risks incident to its business. In accordance with typical industry practice, the Partnership has appropriate levels of business interruption and property insurance on its underground pipeline systems. The Partnership is not insured against all environmental accidents that might occur. If a 48significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured, it could adversely affect the Partnership's operations and financial condition.The adoption of derivatives legislation by the United States Congress and promulgation of related regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with the Partnership's business.Comprehensive financial reform legislation was signed into law by the President on July 21, 2010. The legislation calls for the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to regulate certain markets for derivative products, including over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives. The CFTC has issued several new relevant regulations and other rulemakings are pending at the CFTC, the product of which would be rules that implement the mandates in the new legislation to cause significant portions of derivatives markets to clear through clearinghouses. While some of these rules have been finalized, some have not and, as a result, the final form and timing of the implementation of the new regulatory regime affecting commodity derivatives remains uncertain. In particular, on October 18, 2011, the CFTC adopted final rules under the Dodd-Frank Act establishing position limits for certain energy commodity futures and options contracts and economically equivalent swaps, futures and options. The position limit levels set the maximum amount of covered contracts that a trader may own or control separately or in combination, net long or short. The final rules also contained limited exemptions from position limits which would be phased in over time for certain bona fide hedging transactions and positions. The CFTC's original position limits rule was challenged in court by two industry associations and was vacated and remanded by a federal district court. However, in November 2013, the CFTC proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. The CFTC has sought comment on the position limits rule as reproposed, but these new position limit rules are not yet final and the impact of those provisions on the Partnership is uncertain at this time. The CFTC has withdrawn its appeal of the court order vacating the original position limits rule. The legislation and new regulations may also require counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of its derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties. The new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks the Partnership encounters, reduce the Partnership’s ability to monetize or restructure the Partnership’s existing derivative contracts, and increase the Partnership's exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If the Partnership reduces its use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations, the Partnership’s results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect the Partnership’s ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures and to generate sufficient cash flow to pay quarterly distributions at current levels or at all. The Partnership’s revenues could be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material, adverse effect on the Partnership, its financial condition and its results of operations.The Partnership’s use of derivative financial instruments does not eliminate its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates and has in the past and could in the future result in financial losses or reduce its income.The Partnership’s operations expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices, and the Partnership’s credit facility exposes it to fluctuations in interest rates. The Partnership uses over-the-counter price and basis swaps with other natural gas merchants and financial institutions. Use of these instruments is intended to reduce the Partnership’s exposure to short-term volatility in commodity prices. As of December 31, 2015, the Partnership had hedged only portions of its expected exposures to commodity price risk. In addition, to the extent the Partnership hedges it commodity price risk using swap instruments, the Partnership will forego the benefits of favorable changes in commodity prices. Although the Partnership does not currently have any financial instruments to eliminate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations, we may use financial instruments in the future to offset its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.Even though monitored by management, the Partnership’s hedging activities may fail to protect it and could reduce its earnings and cash flow. The Partnership’s hedging activity may be ineffective or adversely affect cash flow and earnings because, among other factors:•hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of volatile prices;•the Partnership’s counterparty in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay or otherwise fail to perform; and•available hedges may not correspond directly with the risks against which the Partnership seeks protection. For example:•the duration of a hedge may not match the duration of the risk against which the Partnership seeks protection;•variations in the index the Partnership uses to price a commodity hedge may not adequately correlate with variations in the index the Partnership uses to sell the physical commodity (known as basis risk); and49•the Partnership may not produce or process sufficient volumes to cover swap arrangements the Partnership enters into for a given period. If the Partnership’s actual volumes are lower than the volumes the Partnership estimated when entering into a swap for the period, it might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of its derivative obligation without the benefit of cash flow from the sale or purchase of the underlying physical commodity, which could adversely affect the Partnership’s liquidity.A failure in our computer systems or a terrorist or cyber-attack on us, or third parties with whom we have a relationship, may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.We are reliant on technology to conduct our businesses. Our business is dependent upon our operational and financial computer systems to process the data necessary to conduct almost all aspects of our business, including operating our pipelines, truck fleet and storage facilities, recording and reporting commercial and financial transactions and receiving and making payments. Any failure of our computer systems, or those of our customers, suppliers or others with whom we do business, could materially disrupt our ability to operate our business. Unknown entities or groups have mounted so-called “cyber-attacks” on businesses to disable or disrupt computer systems, disrupt operations and steal funds or data. Cyber-attacks could also result in the loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt our operations and critical business functions. In addition, our pipeline systems may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to conduct our business and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future terrorist or cyber-attacks than other targets in the United States. Our insurance may not protect us against such occurrences. Any such terrorist or cyber-attack that affects us or our customers, suppliers or others with whom we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause us to incur a material financial loss, subject us to possible legal claims and liability and/or damage our reputation.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could reduce labor productivity and increase labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's business and results of operations adversely impact its results of operations.Gathering and compression services require laborers skilled in multiple disciplines, such as equipment operators, mechanics and engineers, among others. The Partnership's business is dependent on its ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skill sets to future needs, competition for skilled labor or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. The Partnership's costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the Partnership's ability to manage and operate its business. If the Partnership is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, its results of operations could be negatively affected.Subsidence and coastal erosion could damage the Partnership's pipelines along the Gulf Coast and offshore and the facilities of its customers, which could adversely affect its operations and financial condition.The Partnership's pipeline operations along the Gulf Coast and offshore could be impacted by subsidence and coastal erosion. Such processes could cause serious damage to the Partnership's pipelines, which could affect its ability to provide transportation services. Additionally, such processes could impact the Partnership's customers who operate along the Gulf Coast, and they may be unable to utilize the Partnership's services. Subsidence and coastal erosion could also expose the Partnership's operations to increased risks associated with severe weather conditions, such as hurricanes, flooding and rising sea levels. As a result, the Partnership may incur significant costs to repair and preserve its pipeline infrastructure. Such costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.The Partnership's assets were constructed over many decades which may cause its inspection, maintenance or repair costs to increase in the future. In addition, there could be service interruptions due to unknown events or conditions or increased downtime associated with the Partnership's pipelines that could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.The Partnership's pipelines were constructed over many decades. Pipelines are generally long-lived assets, and pipeline construction and coating techniques have varied over time. Depending on the era of construction, some assets will require more frequent inspections, which could result in increased maintenance or repair expenditures in the future. Any significant increase in these expenditures could adversely affect the Partnership's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, as well as its ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders.50The Partnership's success depends on key members of its management, the loss or replacement of whom could disrupt its business operations.The Partnership depends on the continued employment and performance of the officers of the General Partner and key operational personnel. The General Partner has entered into employment agreements with each of its executive officers. If any of these officers or other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced, the Partnership's business operations could be materially adversely affected. The Partnership does not maintain any “key man” life insurance for any officers.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsWe do not have any unresolved staff comments.
