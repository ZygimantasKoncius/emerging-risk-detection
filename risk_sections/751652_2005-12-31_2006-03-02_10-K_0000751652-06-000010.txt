FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT, 2005 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS. Nature of Business Questar Corporation (Questar or the Company) is a natural gas-focused energy company with four major lines of business  gas and oil exploration and production, midstream field services, interstate gas transportation, and retail gas distribution  which are conducted through its three principal subsidiaries. Questar Market Resources, Inc. (Market Resources) engages in gas and oil exploration, development and production and midstream field services-gas gathering and processing, as well as wholesale gas and oil marketing and gas storage. Questar Pipeline Company (Questar Pipeline) provides interstate natural gas transportation and storage services. Questar Gas Company (Questar Gas) provides retail natural gas distribution. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for financial information concerning Questar's lines of business that cont ribute 10% or more of consolidated revenues. Questar is a holding company, as that term is defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), because its subsidiary Questar Gas is a gas utility company. Questar, however, qualifies for and will file for an exemption and waiver from provisions of the Act applicable to holding companies. PUHCA 2005 supersedes the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 under which Questar qualified for an exemption. Questar conducts most of its operations through subsidiaries. The parent-holding company performs certain management, legal, tax, administrative and other services for its subsidiaries Questar operates in the Rocky Mountain and Midcontinent regions of the United States of America and is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. Shares of Questar common stock trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol STR. The corporate-organization structure and major subsidiaries are summarized below: Market Resources Market Resources is a natural gas-focused energy company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Questar and Questars primary growth driver. Market Resources is a sub-holding company with four principal subsidiaries: Questar Exploration and Production Company (Questar E&P) acquires, explores for, develops and produces natural gas, oil, and NGL; Wexpro Company (Wexpro) manages, develops and produces cost-of-service reserves for affiliated company, Questar Gas; Questar Gas Management Company (Gas Management) provides midstream field services including natural gas-gathering and processing services for affiliates and third parties; and Questar Energy Trading Company (Energy Trading) markets equity and third-party gas and oil, provides risk-management services, and through its wholly owned limited liability company, Clear Creek Storage Company, LLC, owns and operates an underground natura l gas-storage reservoir. Questar E&P Questar E&P operates in two core areas  the Rocky Mountain region of Wyoming, Utah and Colorado and the Midcontinent region of Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana. Questar E&P has a large inventory of identified development drilling locations, primarily on the Pinedale Anticline in western Wyoming and in the Uinta Basin of Utah. Questar E&P continues to conduct exploratory drilling to determine commerciality of its inventory of undeveloped leaseholds located primarily in the Rocky Mountain region, including the assessment of deeper reservoirs under approximately 143,000 net leasehold acres in the Vermillion Basin of southwest Wyoming and northwestern Colorado. In the Midcontinent, Questar E&P has several active development projects, including an ongoing coalbed methane project in the Arkoma Basin of eastern Oklahoma and an infill development drilling project in the El m Grove area in northwestern Louisiana. Questar E&P seeks to maintain geographical and geological diversity with its two core areas. Questar E&P has in the past and may in the future pursue acquisition of producing properties through the purchase of assets or corporate entities to expand its presence in its core areas or create a new core area. Questar E&P reported 1,480 Bcfe of estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2005. Approximately 80% of Questar E&Ps proved reserves, or 1,179 Bcfe, were located in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States, while the remaining 20%, or 301 Bcfe, were located in the Midcontinent region. Approximately 920 Bcfe of the proved reserves reported by Questar E&P at year-end 2005 were developed, while 560 Bcfe were proved undeveloped. The majority of the proved undeveloped reserves were associated with the Companys Pinedale Anticline leasehold. Questar E&Ps primary focus is natural gas. Natural gas comprised about 90% of Questar E&Ps total proved reserves at year-end 2005. See Item 2 in Part I and Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for more information on Questar E&Ps proved reserves. Questar E&P  Competition and Customers Questar E&P faces competition in every part of its business, including the acquisition of reserves and leases. Its longer-term growth strategy depends, in part, on its ability to purchase reasonably priced reserves and develop them in a low-cost and efficient manner. Competition is particularly intense when prices are high, as has been the case in recent years. Questar E&P, through Energy Trading, sells natural gas production to a variety of customers, including pipelines, gas-marketing firms, industrial users and local-distribution companies. It regularly evaluates counterparty credit and may require financial guarantees from parties that fail to meet its credit criteria. Energy Trading sells equity crude-oil production to refiners, remarketers and other companies, including some with pipeline facilities near company producing properties. In the event pipeline facilities are not available, Energy Trading transports crude oil by truck to storage, refining or pipeline facilities. Questar E&P  Regulation Questar E&P's operations are subject to various government controls and regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Questar E&P must obtain permits to drill and produce; maintain bonding requirements to drill and operate wells; submit and implement spill-prevention plans; and file notices relating to the presence, use, and release of specified contaminants incidental to gas and oil production. Questar E&P is also subject to various conservation matters, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units, the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of gas and oil properties. Most Questar E&P leases in the Rocky Mountain area are granted by the federal government and administered by federal agencies. Development of Pinedale leasehold acreage is subject to the terms of certain winter-drilling restrictions. During the last two years, Market Resources has been working with federal and state officials in Wyoming to obtain authorization for limited winter-drilling activities and has developed innovative measures, such as drilling multiple wells from a single location, to minimize the impact of its activities on wildlife and wildlife habitat. The presence of wildlife and potential endangered species could limit access to public lands. Various wildlife species inhabit Market Resources leaseholds at Pinedale and in other areas. Current federal regulations restrict activities during certain times of the year on portions of Market Resources leaseholds due to wildlife activity and/or h abitat. Some species that are known to be present may be listed under federal law as endangered or threatened. Such listing could have a material impact on access to Market Resources leaseholds in certain areas or during periods when the particular species is present. Wexpro Wexpro develops and produces gas and oil on certain properties owned by affiliate Questar Gas under the terms of a comprehensive agreement, the Wexpro Agreement. Pursuant to the Wexpro Agreement, Wexpro recovers its costs and receives an unlevered after-tax return of approximately 19% on its investment in commercial wells and related facilities  adjusted for working capital and reduced for deferred income taxes and depreciation  its investment base. The term of the Wexpro Agreement coincides with the productive life of the gas and oil properties covered therein. Wexpros investment base totaled $206.3 million at December 31, 2005. Wexpro delivers natural gas production to Questar Gas at a price equal to Wexpros cost-of-service. Wexpro cost-of-service gas satisfied 41% of Questar Gas system requirements during 2005 at cost of service pricing that is significantly lower than Questar Gas cost for purchased gas. Wexpro gas and oil-development and production activities are subject to the same type of regulation as Questar E&P. In addition, the Utah Division of Public Utilities has oversight responsibility and retains an outside reservoir-engineering consultant and a financial auditor to assess the prudence of Wexpros activities. Wexpro owns oil-producing properties. Under terms of the Wexpro Agreement, revenues from crude-oil sales offset operating expenses and provide Wexpro with a return on its investment. Any remaining revenues, after recovery of expenses and Wexpro's return on investment, are divided between Wexpro (46%) and Questar Gas (54%). Wexpro operations are contractually limited to a finite set of properties set forth in the Wexpro Agreement. Advances in technology (pad drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracture stimulation) have unlocked significant unexploited potential on many of the subject properties. Wexpro has identified $600 to $750 million of additional drilling opportunities that could support high single-digit to low double-digit growth in revenues and net income over the next five to ten years while delivering cost-of-service natural gas supplies to Questar Gas at prices competitive with alternative sources. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for more information on the Wexpro Agreement. Gas Management Gas Management provides natural gas-gathering and processing services to affiliates and third-party producers in the Rocky Mountain region. Gas Management also owns 50% of Rendezvous Gas Services, LLC, (Rendezvous), a joint venture that operates gas-gathering facilities in western Wyoming. Rendezvous gathers natural gas for Pinedale Anticline and Jonah field producers for delivery to various interstate pipelines. Under a contract with Questar Gas, Gas Management also gathers cost-of-service volumes produced from properties operated by Wexpro. Approximately 56% of Gas Management's revenues are derived from fee-based gathering and processing agreements. The remaining revenues are derived from natural gas processing margins that are in part exposed to the frac spread. To reduce processing margin risk, Gas Management has restructured many of its processing agreements with producers from keep-whole contracts to fee-based contracts. A keep-whole contract insulates producers from frac spread risk while a fee-based contract eliminates commodity price risk for the processing plant owner. To further reduce processing margin volatility associated with keep-whole contracts, Gas Management may also attempt to reduce processing margin risk with forward-sales contracts for NGL or hedge NGL prices and equivalent gas volumes with the intent to lock in a processing margin. Energy Trading Energy Trading markets natural gas, oil and NGL. It combines gas volumes purchased from third parties and equity production to build a flexible and reliable portfolio. As a wholesale marketing entity, Energy Trading concentrates on markets in the Rocky Mountains, Pacific Northwest and Midcontinent that are close to reserves owned by affiliates or accessible by major pipelines. It contracts for firm-transportation capacity on pipelines and firm-storage capacity at Clay Basin, a large baseload-storage facility owned by affiliate Questar Pipeline. Energy Trading, through its Clear Creek Storage Company, LLC, operates an underground gas-storage reservoir in southwestern Wyoming. It uses owned and leased-storage capacity together with firm-transportation capacity to take advantage of price differentials and arbitrage opportunities. Energy Trading uses derivatives to manage commodity price risk. Energy Trading primarily uses fixed-price swaps to secure a known price for a specific volume of company production. Energy Trading does not engage in speculative hedging transactions. See Notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Item 7A in Part II of this Annual Report for additional information relating to hedging activities. Questar Pipeline Questar Pipeline is an interstate pipeline company that provides natural gas-transportation and underground storage services in Utah, Wyoming and Colorado. As a natural gas company under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, Questar Pipeline and certain subsidiary pipeline companies are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as to rates and charges for storage and transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, construction of new facilities, and extensions or abandonments of service and facilities, accounting and other activities. Questar Pipeline and its subsidiaries own 2,499 miles of interstate pipeline with total daily capacity of 3,399 Mdth. Questar Pipeline's core-transmission system is strategically located in the Rocky Mountain area near large reserves of natural gas in six major Rocky Mountain producing areas. Questar Pipeline transports natural gas from these producing areas to other major pipeline systems and to the Questar Gas distribution system. In addition to this core system, Questar Pipeline, through a subsidiary, owns and operates the Southern Trails Pipeline, a 488-mile line that extends from the Blanco hub in the San Juan Basin to just inside the California state line. Questar Pipeline owns and operates the Clay Basin storage facility, the largest underground- storage reservoir in the Rocky Mountain region. Through a subsidiary, Questar Pipeline also owns gathering lines and a processing plant near Price, Utah, which provides heat-content-management services for Questar Gas and carbon-dioxide extraction for third parties. Questar Pipeline  Customers, Growth and Competition Questar Pipeline faces risk of recontracting firm capacity as contract terms expire. Questar Pipelines transportation system is nearly fully subscribed, and firm contracts had a weighted-average remaining life of 10.9 years as of December 31, 2005. All of Questar Pipeline storage capacity is fully contracted with a weighted-average remaining life of 8.0 years as of December 31, 2005. Questar Gas remains Questar Pipeline's largest transportation customer. During 2005, Questar Pipeline transported 116.3 MMdth for Questar Gas compared to 116.5 MMdth in 2004. Questar Gas has reserved firm-transportation capacity of 951 Mdth per day under long-term contracts, or about 50% of Questar Pipeline's reserved capacity, during the three coldest months of the year. Questar Pipeline's primary transportation agreement with Questar Gas will expire on June 30, 2017. Questar Pipeline also transported 259.3 MMdth for nonaffiliated customers to pipelines owned by Kern River Pipeline, Northwest Pipeline, Colorado Interstate Gas, TransColorado, Wyoming Interstate Company and other systems. Questar Pipeline may be adversely affected by proposals before the FERC to establish natural gas-quality standards, specifically for hydrocarbon dewpoint. Questar Pipeline's tariff allows a higher hydrocarbon dewpoint specification than most other systems, which requires less processing by producers before natural gas volumes are delivered into Questar Pipeline's system. As a consequence, Questar Pipeline must incur higher costs to blend lower dewpoint-processed gas with wet gas and in some instances isolate processed gas for delivery to other pipelines. In effect, Questar Pipeline currently provides a bundled gas-transportation and dewpoint-management service for shippers at certain deli very points. Questar Pipeline may need to restructure its tariff to unbundle these services. During 2005, Questar Pipeline expanded its southern system in central Utah. This expansion was completed and placed into service in the fourth quarter of the year and added 102 Mdth of daily capacity under long-term contracts. Questar Pipeline received FERC approval for the expansion in January 2005. Also, Questar Pipeline began service to a new power plant near Mona, Utah in the second quarter of 2005. These projects will contribute about $3 million in net income per year. Rocky Mountain producers, marketers and end-users seek capacity on interstate pipelines that move gas to California (Kern River), the Pacific Northwest (Northwest Pipeline) or Midwestern markets (Wyoming Interstate Company and Colorado Interstate Gas). Questar Pipeline provides access for many producers to these third-party pipelines. Some parties, including Gas Management, an affiliate of Questar Pipeline, are building gathering lines that allow producers to make direct connections to competing pipeline systems. Questar Pipeline seeks to extend and expand its core pipeline and storage business. Questar Pipeline has proposed to further expand its southern system in central Utah. In addition, Questar Pipeline and other pipelines have proposed projects to connect northwestern Colorado and southwestern Wyoming gas supplies with pipelines moving gas east out of Wyoming. Following successful open seasons in 2005, Questar Pipeline is finalizing contracts with customers to support these new projects. Questar Pipeline is also assessing the feasibility of a gas-storage project in western Wyoming. Southern Trails Pipeline. In mid-2002, Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, a Questar Pipeline subsidiary, placed the eastern segment of the Southern Trails pipeline into service. The eastern segment extends from the San Juan Basin to inside the California border. Capacity on this segment is fully committed under contracts that expire in mid-2008 and mid-2015. The California segment of the Southern Trails Pipeline, which extends from near the California-Arizona border to Long Beach, California, is currently not in service. Questar Pipeline is pursuing several options to sell or place this line in service. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for discussion of an impairment of the California segment of Southern Trails. Questar Pipeline  Regulation FERC Order No. 2004 requires employees engaged in transportation system operations to function independently from employees of marketing and energy affiliates. In addition a transportation provider must treat all transportation customers on a non-discriminatory basis and must not operate its transportation system to preferentially benefit its marketing or energy affiliates. Questar Pipeline has determined that all Market Resources subsidiaries except Gas Management are marketing or energy affiliates. Questar Gas is not an energy or marketing affiliate. Questar Pipeline is required to comply with the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. This Act and the rules issued by the DOT require interstate pipelines and local distribution companies to implement a 10-year program of risk analysis, pipeline assessment and remedial repair for transportation pipelines located in high-consequence areas such as densely populated locations. Questar Pipelines annual cost to comply with the Act is approximately $1 million, not including costs of pipeline replacement, if necessary. Clay Basin Storage Gas. See Results of Operation included in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for discussion of Clay Basin storage gas loss. Questar Gas Questar Gas distributes natural gas as a public utility in Utah, southwestern Wyoming and a small portion of southeastern Idaho. As of December 31, 2005, Questar Gas was serving 824,447 sales and transportation customers. Questar Gas is the only non-municipal gas-distribution utility in Utah, where over 96% of its customers are located. The Public Service Commission of Utah (PSCU), the Public Service Commission of Wyoming (PSCW) and the Public Utility Commission of Idaho have granted Questar Gas the necessary regulatory approvals to serve these areas. Questar Gas also has long-term franchises granted by communities and counties within its service area. Questar Gas growth is tied to the economic growth of Utah and southwestern Wyoming. It has over 90% of the load for residential space heating and water heating in its service territory. During 2005, Questar Gas added a record 30,330 customers, a 3.8% increase. Questar Gas faces the same risks as other local-distribution companies. These risks include revenue variations based on seasonal changes in demand, sufficient gas supplies, declining residential usage per customer, adequate distribution facilities and adverse regulatory decisions. Questar Gas's sales to residential and commercial customers are seasonal, with a substantial portion of such sales made during the heating season. The typical residential customer in Utah (defined as a customer using 115 dth per year) consumes over 77% of total gas requirements in the coldest six months of the year. Questar Gas, however, has a weather-normalization mechanism for its general-service customers. This mechanism adjusts the non-gas portion of a customer's monthly bill as the actual heating-degree days in the billing cycle are warmer or colder than normal. This mechanism reduces dramatic fluctuations in any given custom er's monthly bill from year to year and reduces fluctuations in Questar Gas gross margin. Questar Gas minimizes gas supply risks by owning natural gas reserves. During 2005, Questar Gas satisfied 41% of its system requirements with the cost-of-service gas and associated royalty-interest volumes. Wexpro produces the gas from these properties, which is then gathered by Gas Management and transported by Questar Pipeline. Questar Gas had estimated proved cost-of-service natural gas reserves of 497.3 Bcf as of year-end 2005 compared to 531.1 Bcf a year earlier. Questar Gas also has a balanced and diversified portfolio of gas-supply contracts for volumes produced in Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah. Questar Gas has regulatory approval to include costs associated with hedging activities in its balancing account for pass-through treatment. Questar Gas has designed its distribution system and annual gas-supply plan to handle design-day demand requirements. It periodically updates its design-day demand, the volume of gas that firm customers could use during extremely cold weather. For the 2005-06 heating season, Questar Gas used a design-day demand of 1,106 Mdth for firm customers. Questar Gas has long-term contracts with Questar Pipeline for transportation and storage capacity at Clay Basin and three peak-day storage facilities. Questar Gas also has contracts to take deliveries at several locations on the Kern River Pipeline. Questar Gas  Regulation As a public utility, Questar Gas is subject to the jurisdiction of the PSCU and PSCW. Natural gas sales and transportation services are made under rate schedules approved by the two regulatory commissions. Questar Gas is authorized to earn a return on equity of 11.2% in Utah and 11.83% in Wyoming. Both the PSCU and PSCW permit Questar Gas to recover gas costs through a balancing-account procedure and to reflect natural gas-price changes on a periodic, generally semi-annual basis. Questar Gas has also received permission from the PSCU and PCSW to reflect in its gas costs specified costs associated with hedging contracts. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report for a discussion of gas-processing cost coverage. Questar Gas has significant relationships with affiliates that have allowed it to lower its costs and improve efficiency. These affiliate relationships, however, are subject to oversight by regulatory commissions for evidence of subsidization and above-market payments. Questar Gas is subject to the requirements of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act. Questar Gas estimates that it will cost $4.0 to $5.0 million per year to comply with the Act, not including costs of pipeline replacement if necessary. The PSCU has allowed Questar Gas to record a regulatory asset for these incremental operating costs incurred to comply with this Act until the next rate case or 2007, whichever is sooner. Questar Gas  Competition Questar Gas is a public utility and currently has no direct competition from other distributors of natural gas for residential and commercial customers. It has historically enjoyed a favorable price comparison with other energy sources used by residential and commercial customers except coal and occasionally fuel oil. It provides transportation service to industrial customers that can buy volumes of gas directly from others. Questar Gas earns lower margins on this transportation service than firm-sales service and could lose customers to Kern River. Corporate and Other Operations Historically, Questar's Other Operations included information-technology and communication services; web-hosting and data centers (Consonus); commercial real-estate management; and wellhead gas analysis and automation, field compression and engine maintenance (Energy Services). Questar reorganized these activities in 2004 and 2005 to refocus attention on its primary business activities and reduce costs. Questar has no plans to enlarge the scope of these activities. The majority of information-technology employees and assets were transferred to the separate business segments, and the assets of Consonus were sold. The scope of commercial real estate activities was significantly reduced. Energy Services focuses on wellhead automation and gas analysis.

Investors should read carefully the following factors as well as the cautionary statements referred to in Forward-Looking Statements herein. If any of the risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report actually occur, the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The future price of natural gas, oil and NGL is unpredictable. Historically the price of natural gas, oil and NGL has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Any significant or extended decline in commodity prices would impact the Companys future financial condition, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and rate of growth. Because approximately 90% of Questars proved reserves at December 31, 2005, was natural gas, the Company is substantially more sensitive to changes in natural gas prices than to changes in oil prices. Questar cannot predict the future price of natural gas, oil and NGL because of factors beyond its control, including but not limited to: * changes in domestic and foreign supply of natural gas, oil and NGL; * changes in local, regional, national and global demand for natural gas, oil, and NGL; * regional price differences resulting from available pipeline transportation capacity or local demand; * the level of imports of, and the price of, foreign natural gas, oil and NGL; * domestic and global economic conditions; * domestic political developments; * weather conditions; * domestic and foreign government regulations and taxes; * political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; * the price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels; * U.S. storage levels of natural gas, oil, and NGL. Questar uses derivative instruments to manage exposure to uncertain prices. Questar uses financial contracts to hedge exposure to volatile natural gas, oil, and NGL prices and to protect cash flow, returns on capital, net income and credit ratings from downward commodity price movements. To the extent the Company hedges commodity price exposure, it forgoes the benefits otherwise experienced if commodity prices increase. Questar believes its regulated businesses  interstate natural gas transportation and retail gas distribution  and its Wexpro subsidiary generate revenues that are not significantly sensitive to short-term fluctuations in commodity prices. Questar enters into commodity price hedging arrangements with creditworthy counterparties (banks and industry participants) with a variety of credit requirements. Some contracts do not require the Company to post cash collateral, while others allow some amount of credit before requiring deposits of collateral for out-of-the-money hedges. The amount of credit available may vary depending on the credit rating assigned to the Companys debt securities. A substantial increase in the price of natural gas, oil and/or NGL could result in the requirement to deposit large amounts of collateral with counterparties that could seriously impact the Companys cash liquidity. Additionally a downgrade in the Companys credit ratings to sub-investment grade could result in the acceleration of obligations to hedge counterparties. The Company may not be able to economically find and develop new reserves. The Companys profitability depends not only on prevailing prices for natural gas, oil and NGL, but also its ability to find, develop and acquire gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable. Substantial capital expenditures are required to find, develop and acquire gas and oil reserves to replace those depleted by production. Gas and oil reserve estimates are imprecise and subject to revision. Questar E&Ps proved natural gas and oil reserve estimates are prepared annually by independent reservoir-engineering consultants. Gas and oil reserve estimates are subject to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures. The accuracy of these estimates depends on the quality of available data and on engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Reserve estimates are imprecise and will change as additional information becomes available. Estimates of economically recoverable reserves and future net cash flows prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times may vary significantly. Results of subsequent drilling, testing and production may cause either upward or downward revisions of previous estimates. In addition the estimation process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, severance and other taxes, capital expenditures and remedial costs. Actual results most likely will vary from the estimates. Any significant variance could reduce the estimated future net revenues from proved reserves and the present value of those reserves. Investors should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from Questar E&Ps proved reserves referred to in this Annual Report is the current market value of the estimated natural gas and oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from Questar E&Ps proved reserves is based on prices and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices constant throughout the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the current estimate, and future determinations of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. Questar faces many operating risks to develop and produce its reserves. Drilling is a high-risk activity. Operating risks include: fire, explosions and blow-outs; unexpected drilling conditions such as abnormally pressured formations; abandonment costs; pipe, cement or casing failures; environmental accidents such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases, brine or well fluids (including groundwater contamination). The Company could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life; pollution or other environmental damage; damage to or destruction of property and equipment; regulatory investigation; fines or curtailment of operations; or attorneys fees and other expenses incurred in the prosecution or defense of litigation. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, the Company maintains insurance against some, but not all, of these potential risks and losses. Questar can not assure that insurance will be adequate to cover these losses or liabilities. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or underinsured events could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and operations. Shortages of oilfield equipment, services and qualified personnel could impact results of operations. The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. There have also been shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment, as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. These factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand and result in increased costs for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. These shortages or cost increases could impact profit margin, cash flow and operating results or restrict the ability to drill wells and conduct operations. A significant portion of Market Resources production, revenue and cash flow are derived from assets that are concentrated in a geographical area. While geographic concentration of assets provides scope and scale that can reduce operating costs and provide other operating synergies, asset concentration does increase exposure to certain risks. Market Resources has extensive operations on the Pinedale Anticline and in the Greater Green River Basin of southwestern Wyoming. Any circumstance or event that negatively impacts the operations of Questar E&P, Wexpro or Gas Management in that area could materially reduce earnings and cash flow. Questar is subject to complex regulations on many levels. The Company is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and tend to become more onerous over time. In addition to the costs of compliance, substantial costs may be incurred to take corrective actions at both owned and previously owned facilities. Accidental spills and leaks requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. As standards change, the Company may incur significant costs in cases where past operations followed practices that were considered acceptable at the time but that now require remedial work to meet current standards. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in fines, significant costs for remedial activities, or injunctions. Questar must comply with numerous and complex regulations governing activities on federal and state lands in the Rocky Mountain region, notably the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act. Federal and state agencies frequently impose conditions on the Companys activities. These restrictions tend to become more stringent over time and can limit or prevent exploring for, finding and producing natural gas and oil on the Companys Rockies leasehold. Certain environmental groups oppose drilling on some of Market Resources federal and state leases. Various federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the Minerals Management Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, along with each Native American tribe, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to gas and oil operations on Native American tribal lands. These regulations include such matters as lease provisions, drilling and production requirements, environmental standards and royalty considerations. In addition each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce laws and regulations independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. These tribal laws and regulations include various taxes, fees, requirements to employ Native American tribal members and other conditions that apply to lessees, operators and contractors conducting operations on Native American tribal lands. Finally, lessees and operators con ducting operations on tribal lands are generally subject to the Native American tribal court system. One or more of these factors may increase the Companys costs of doing business on Native American tribal lands and have an impact on the viability of its gas, oil and transportation operations on such lands. Both Questar Pipeline and Questar Gas incur significant costs to comply with federal pipeline-safety regulations. Questar may also be affected by possible future regulations requiring the tracking, reporting and reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions. FERC regulates interstate transportation of natural gas. Questar Pipelines natural gas transportation and storage operations are regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. The FERC has authority to: set rates for natural gas transportation, storage and related services; set rules governing business relationships between the pipeline subsidiary and its affiliates; approve new pipeline and storage-facility construction; and establish policies and procedures for accounting, purchase, sale, abandonment and other activities. FERC policies may adversely affect Questar Pipeline profitability. The FERC also has various affiliate rules that may cause the Company to incur additional costs of compliance. State agencies regulate the distribution of natural gas. Questar Gas natural gas-distribution business is regulated by the PSCU and the PSCW. These commissions set rates for distribution services and establish policies and procedures for services, accounting, purchase, sale and other activities. PSCU and PSCW policies may adversely affect Questar Gas profitability. Questar is dependent on bank credit facilities and continued access to capital markets to successfully execute its operating strategies. The Company relies on bank borrowing and access to public capital markets to finance a material portion of its operating strategies. Also, Questar relies on access to short-term commercial paper markets. The Company is dependent on these capital sources to provide capital to acquire and develop properties. The availability and cost of these credit sources is cyclical, and these capital sources may not remain available or the Company may not be able to obtain money at a reasonable cost in the future. All Questars bank loans are floating-rate debt. From time to time the Company may use interest rate derivatives to fix the rate on a portion of its variable rate debt. The interest rates on bank loans are tied to debt credit rat ings of Questar and its subsidiaries published by Standard & Poor's and Moody's. A downgrade of credit ratings could increase the interest cost of debt and decrease future availability of money from banks and other sources. Management believes it is important to maintain investment grade credit ratings to conduct the Companys businesses, but may not be able to keep investment grade ratings. General economic and other conditions impact Questars results. Questars results may also be negatively affected by: changes in general economic conditions; changes in regulation; availability and economic viability of gas and oil properties for sale or exploration; creditworthiness of counterparties; rate of inflation and interest rates; assumptions used in business combinations; weather and natural disasters; changes in customers' credit ratings; competition from other forms of energy, other pipelines and storage facilities; effects of accounting policies issued periodically by accounting standard-setting bodies; terrorist attacks or acts of war; changes in business or financial condition; changes in credit ratings; and availability of financing for Questar.
