Item 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained herein or incorporated herein by reference, the risks and uncertainties and other factors described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price and could also cause our future business, financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from the results contemplated by any forward-looking statement we may make herein, in any other document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or in any press release or other written or oral statement we may make. Please also see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition And Results of OperationsÂ—Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" for additional risks and uncertainties applicable to us. Our business is subject to intense competition. Royalties paid to us under our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of our licensee's net sales of licensed products. Cherokee, Carole Little and Sideout brand footwear, apparel, and accessories, which are manufactured and sold by both domestic and international wholesalers and retail licensees, are subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign companies. Such competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne, and private label brands such as Faded Glory, Arizona, and Route 66, developed by retailers. Factors which shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price and the manufacturer's ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis. In recognition of the increasing trend towards consolidation of retailers and what appears to be a de-emphasis by retailers on the manufacture of private label merchandise, in the United States our business plan focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers. Therefore, our degree of success is dependent on the strength of our brands, consumer acceptance of and desire for our brands, our licensees' ability to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to respond to ever-changing consumer demands, and any significant failure by our licensees to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We cannot control the level of resources that our licensees commit to supporting our brands, and our licensees may choose to support other brands to the detriment of ours. There are numerous risk factors that apply to the businesses of retailers that can affect their level of sales of products that carry our brands. Any decline in sales by our licensees can adversely affect our revenues. Factors that may adversely affect retailers include the following: weather; changes in the availability or cost of capital; shifts in the seasonality of shopping patterns; labor strikes or other work interruptions including work interruptions that impact supply chains and transport vendors; the impact of excess retail capacity; changes in the cost of accepting various payment methods and changes in the rate of utilization of these payment methods; material acquisitions or dispositions; investments in new business strategies; the success or failure of significant new business ventures or technologies; actions taken or omitted to be taken by legislative, regulatory, judicial and other governmental authorities and officials; and natural disasters, the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events. In addition, other companies owning established trademarks could also enter into similar arrangements with retailers, including our existing retail partners, competing for limited floor pad and rack space. 8 Table of Contents Our business is largely dependent on royalties from one licensee, Target, which accounted for 54% of our consolidated licensing revenues in Fiscal 2012. During Fiscal 2012, 54% of our licensing revenues were generated from Target. We could suffer substantially decreased royalty revenues and cash flow under the Restated Target Agreement if Target were to reduce its sales of Cherokee branded products while continuing to pay the minimum royalties of $9.0 million per fiscal year required under such agreement. Replacing the royalty payments received from Target would be a significant challenge and no assurances can be made that we would be successful in doing so. The termination of this license agreement would have a material adverse effect upon our revenues and cash flow. Our business may be negatively impacted by general economic conditions. Our performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and its corresponding impact on the levels of consumer spending which may affect our licensees' sales. Consumer spending is showing signs of stabilization and in some cases improvement; however it is difficult to predict future levels of consumer spending and any such predictions are inherently uncertain. The worldwide apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles. Purchases of apparel and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, as disposable income typically declines. Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industries, including, among others, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, energy costs, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. During periods of economic uncertainty, we may not be able to maintain, or increase our revenues. As a result, our operating results may be materially affected by trends in the United States or global economy. The risks associated with our business are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession. In addition to other consequences, these periods may be accompanied by decreased consumer spending generally, as well as decreased demand for, or additional downward pricing pressure on, the products carrying our brands. Accordingly, any prolonged economic slowdown or a lengthy or severe recession with respect to either the U.S. or the global economy is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. Our business and the success of our products could be harmed if we are unable to maintain the strength of our brands. Our success to date has been due in large part to the strength of our brands. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the strength of our brands may be impaired. Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider one or more of our brands to be outdated or associate one or more of our brands with styles that are no longer popular. In the past, many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses. Our business may be similarly affected in the future. We are dependent on our intellectual property, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully protect our rights. We hold various trademarks including Cherokee, Sideout, Carole Little and others in connection with apparel, footwear, home and accessories. These trademarks are vital to the success and future growth of our business. These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in numerous other countries. We also hold several trademark applications for Cherokee and Sideout in approximately 100 countries. There can be no assurance that the actions taken by us to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will prevent imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others, or prevent the loss of licensing revenue or other damages caused thereby. 9 Table of Contents In addition, the laws of several countries in which we have licensed our intellectual property may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property, which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In the future we may be required to assert infringement claims against third parties, and there can be no assurance that one or more parties will not assert infringement claims against us. Any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our management personnel whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor. We must successfully maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems. We rely on various information technology systems, including our recently purchased Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that was fully implemented as of the first quarter of Fiscal 2012, to manage our operations, which subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading, replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our information technology, potential disruption of our internal control systems, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and other risks of delays or difficulties in upgrading, transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems. We are dependent on our key management personnel. Our success is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key executives, including, Henry Stupp, our Chief Executive Officer, Howard Siegel, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark DiSiena, our Chief Financial Officer. We have a limited number of employees and Mr. Stupp's and our other executives' leadership and experience in the apparel licensing industry is important to the successful implementation of our business and marketing strategy. We do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our executives. The loss of the services of Mr. Stupp or our other key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We currently have debt of approximately $7,000,000 in aggregate principal and we are subject to various restrictive covenants while such debt is outstanding. In Fiscal 2011, we entered into a term loan agreement with U.S. Bank (the "Bank"), as amended on September 6, 2011 and as amended and restated on December 7, 2011, pursuant to which we have currently borrowed $7,000,000 in aggregate principal (as currently in effect, the "Loan Facility"), consisting of (i) a term loan in the principal amount of $5,000,000, which loan is to be repaid in full on or before November 30, 2013 (the "Two Year Facility") and (ii) a term loan in the principal amount of $2,000,000, which loan is to be repaid in full on or before November 30, 2015 (the "Four Year Facility"). The Two Year Facility does not require principal payments prior it its maturity and bears interest to be paid in monthly installments, with such interest calculated at a floating rate equal to either (i) the Bank's prime rate minus 0.25% or (ii) 2.00% plus the 1, 2 or 3 month LIBOR rate, as selected by Cherokee. The Four Year Facility requires principal to be repaid in equal monthly installments of $41,666.67, plus interest, with such interest calculated at a floating rate equal to either (i) the Bank's prime rate minus 0.25% or (ii) 2.75% plus the 1, 2 or 3 month LIBOR rate, as selected by Cherokee. The Loan Facility is secured by all of Cherokee's assets and guaranteed by Cherokee's wholly owned subsidiary, Spell C. LLC. The Loan Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for loan agreements and transactions of this type, including limitations on our ability to incur debt or other liabilities, a requirement that we maintain cash deposits of at least $5,000,000, covenants regarding our profitability and our ability to satisfy our fixed financing expenses in each quarterly period, and limitations on our ability to consummate acquisitions in any fiscal year in excess of $5,000,000 or in excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate while the Loan Facility is outstanding. 10 Table of Contents Our failure to comply with the terms of our Loan Facility could result in a material adverse effect to our business, including our financial condition and our liquidity. We may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management. From time to time we may consider engaging in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases and out-licensing or in-licensing of brands, intellectual property rights or other assets. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including, among others, exposure to unknown liabilities, disruption of our business and diversion of our management's time and attention in order to develop acquired brands, intellectual property rights or other assets, difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel, and inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses. Accordingly, although we may not choose to undertake or may not be able to successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do complete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Our strategic and marketing initiatives may not be successful. In recent periods, we have invested significant funds and management time in furtherance of our global strategic and marketing initiatives, which are designed to strengthen our brands, assist our licensees in generating increased sales of applicable Cherokee-branded products and build value for our stockholders over the long term. We expect to continue and, in some cases, expand such initiatives in future periods. While we are hopeful that our efforts in executing on such initiatives will expand our business and build stockholder value over the long term, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in doing so or that such initiatives will result in the benefits to us that they are intended to generate. Any failure by us to execute on our strategic initiatives, or the failure of such initiatives to cause our revenues to grow, could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results and financial performance. We may not pay dividends regularly or at all in the future. Although we have paid dividends during each quarter since December 2003, and including during the first quarter of Fiscal 2013, our Board of Directors may reduce or discontinue dividends at any time for any reason it deems relevant and there can be no assurances that we will continue to generate sufficient cash to pay dividends, or that we will continue to pay dividends with the cash that we do generate as a result of a various factors, such as our existing debt and any business or strategic opportunities that may arise, as determined by our Board of Directors. Our ability to generate excess cash from our operations in the future is dependent upon a variety of factors, including Cherokee's financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital requirements and other factors. In Fiscal 2012, we paid a total of $6.7 million in dividends, which was less than our net income of $7.5 million for Fiscal 2012. Should our cash from operations be lower in future periods, we will reduce the excess cash on our balance sheet and our Board of Directors may elect to further reduce or eliminate future dividend payments. Furthermore, should the dividend tax laws change such that taxes on dividends become higher than they currently are, we may further reduce or eliminate the dividends we pay to our stockholders in favor of other ways to increase value for our stockholders. 11 Table of Contents The trading price of our stock may be volatile. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be subject to fluctuations as a result of various factors impacting our business, including (i) our financial results, (ii) announcements by us, our retail partners or by our competitors, as applicable, regarding or affecting the retail environment either domestically or internationally, our existing license agreements, our existing brand representations, new license agreements, new brand representations or strategic alliances or other agreements, (iii) recruitment or departure of key personnel, (iv) changes in the estimates of our financial results or changes in the recommendations of any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock, and (v) market conditions in the retail industry and the economy as a whole. Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of "blank check" preferred stock. Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of "blank check" preferred stock, without action by our stockholders. Such shares of preferred stock may be issued on terms determined by our Board of Directors, and may have rights, privileges and preferences superior to those of our common stock. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) such shares of preferred stock could have liquidation rights that are senior to the liquidation preference applicable to our common stock, (ii) such shares of preferred stock could have voting or conversion rights, which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock and (iii) the ownership interest of holders of our common stock will be diluted following the issuance of any such shares of preferred stock.
