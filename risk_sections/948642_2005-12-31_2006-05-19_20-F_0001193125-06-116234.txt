Risk Factors Risks associated with Telecom Italias ownership chain. Although, as a result of the Merger, no shareholder controlled Telecom Italia, because of the voto di lista system for the election of directors, currently 14 out of 21 of Telecom Italia directors (of whom 13 are considered independent) were elected from a slate of candidates proposed by Olimpia, which is currently the largest shareholder in Telecom Italia with an interest of approximately 18%. Please see Item 4. Information on the Telecom Italia Group4.1. Business4.1.1 Background. In addition, Marco Tronchetti Provera and Carlo Orazio Buora, respectively Chairman and co-Chief Executive Officer of Telecom Italia, are also, respectively, Chairman and Managing Director of Pirelli & C. S.p.A., which currently owns a 57.66% stake in Olimpia. Such stake may increase as a result of certain Olimpia shareholders exercising their rights under the Olimpia Shareholders Agreements. Please see Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related-Party Transactions7.1 Major Shareholders7.1.1 The Olimpia Shareholders Agreements. Mr. Tronchetti Provera is Chairman of Olimpia, and Mr. Buora is a member of Olimpias board of directors. Please see Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees6.1 Directors6.1.1 Biographical Data for more information. Although Olimpia does not and will not own a controlling interest in Telecom Italia voting shares, Olimpia may exert a significant influence on all matters to be decided by a vote of shareholders. In addition, as a result of its proposal of a majority of the present Telecom Italia Board members, Olimpia may be able to influence certain corporate actions. In principle, the interests of Olimpia in deciding shareholder matters could be different from the interests of Telecom Italias other Ordinary Shareholders, and it is possible that certain decisions could be taken that may be influenced by the needs of Olimpia. Olimpia is in effect a holding company and the sole full operating company in which it holds shares is Telecom Italia. Therefore, if Olimpia were unable to obtain additional funding from new or existing shareholders or from other sources, Olimpia would be entirely dependent on dividends paid on its Telecom Italia shares for its funding needs, including to reimburse its existing debt. Under such circumstances, among the Telecom Italia corporate decisions that could be influenced by the needs of Olimpia would be the level of dividends payable by Telecom Italia to its shareholders. Telecom Italias financial position is not directly related to Olimpia andas suchTelecom Italia does not have any obligations with respect to such debt since they are separate legal entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, since certain rating agencies view Olimpias and Telecom Italias financial position together, such a view could affect our debt ratings, which may adversely affect Telecom Italias financial flexibility and its cost of capital. Although no shareholder controls Telecom Italia and thus is in a position to prevent a takeover of Telecom Italia, the Italian State, through the Treasury, is in a position to exert certain powers with respect to Telecom Italia through the exercise of the special powers included in Telecom Italias Bylaws pursuant to compulsory legal provisions: specifically the so-called Golden Share still provides for the Italian States authority to oppose the acquisition of material interests in our share capital (which is defined as 3% of the voting share capital). Currently, the exercise of special powers by the Italian State with respect to privatized companies (including Telecom Italia) is governed by ad hoc rules, but it is possible that the Italian States Golden Share could make a merger with or takeover of Telecom Italia more difficult or discourage certain bidders from making an offer. Please see Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related-Party Transactions7.1 Major Shareholders7.1.3 Continuing Relationship with the Italian Treasury for more information. System failures could result in reduced user traffic and reduced revenue and could harm Telecom Italias reputation. Our technical infrastructure (including our network infrastructure for fixed-line and mobile telecommunication services) is vulnerable to damage or interruption from information and telecommunication technology failures, power loss, floods, windstorms, fires, terrorism, intentional wrongdoing, human error and similar events. Unanticipated problems at our facilities, system failures, hardware or software failures, computer viruses or hacker attacks could affect the quality of our services and cause service interruptions. Any of these occurrences could result in reduced user traffic and reduced revenue and could harm our reputation. 10 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information XXXXXX Identification of significant deficiencies or material weaknesses as a result of our implementation of procedures designed to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 relating to evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our securities. Commencing with our annual report on Form 20-F for the year ending December 31, 2006, we will include a report from our management relating to its evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a consequence of systems and procedures currently being reviewed and implemented to comply with these requirements, we may uncover circumstances that may be determined to be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, or that may otherwise result in disclosable conditions. Although we intend to take prompt measures to remediate any such identified significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control structure, measures of this kind may involve significant effort and expense, and any disclosure of such significant deficiencies, material weaknesses or other disclosable conditions may result in a negative market reaction. 11 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Exchange Rates 3.2 EXCHANGE RATES We publish our consolidated financial statements in euros. References to , euro and Euro are to the euro, the single unified currency that was introduced in Italy and 10 other member states of the EU on January 1, 1999. References to lire, lira and Lit. are to Italian lire, the former Italian non-decimal denomination of the euro, and references to U.S. dollars, dollars, U.S.$ or $ are to U.S. dollars, the currency of the United States of America. The exchange rate at which the lira was irrevocably fixed against the euro is Lit.1,936.27 = 1.00. For convenience only (except where noted otherwise), certain euro figures have been translated into dollars at the rate (the Euro/Dollar Exchange Rate) of 1.00= U.S.$1.1842, using the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers in foreign currencies as announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for customs purposes (the Noon Buying Rate) on December 30, 2005. These translations should not be construed as a representation that the euro amounts actually represent such dollar amounts or have been or could be converted into dollars at the rate indicated. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York no longer quotes a Noon Buying Rate for the legacy currencies of any of the Member States. For the purpose of this Annual Report, billion means a thousand million.

The Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares of Old Telecom Italia and the Ordinary Shares of Olivetti have traded on Mercato Telematico Azionario (Telematico), managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (Borsa Italiana) in euro since January 4, 1999. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the U.S. dollar will affect the U.S. dollar equivalent of the euro price of the Ordinary Shares and the Savings Shares and the price of the Ordinary Share American Depositary Shares (Ordinary Share ADSs) and the Savings Share American Depositary Shares (Savings Share ADSs), on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Cash dividends were paid by Old Telecom Italia and Olivetti in lire until 2001 (Olivetti paid no dividend in 2001) and in euro starting from 2002 (Olivetti paid no dividend in 2002). Exchange rate fluctuations will affect the U.S. dollar amounts received by owners of Ordinary Share ADSs and Savings Share ADSs upon conversion by the Depositary of cash dividends paid in euro on the underlying Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares. See Item 10. Additional Information10.5 Description of American Depositary Receipts. On completion of the Merger, Telecom Italia (formerly Olivetti) became a successor registrant to Old Telecom Italia under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act) and, therefore, became subject to and continues to file periodic reports under the 1934 Act required for a foreign private issuer. Telecom Italia (formerly Olivetti) obtained a listing of the Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares issued at completion of the Merger, on the NYSE where such Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares trade in the form of ADSs. 12 Table of Contents Item 3.

(2) The average number of employees in the Group (excluding employees relating to the consolidated companies considered as discontinued operations / assets held for sale and including temporary employees) was 79,602 and 79,869 in 2004 and 2005, respectively. (3) In accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per share, basic earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the Groups net income available to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, excluding treasury shares. Since Telecom Italia, has both Ordinary and Savings Shares outstanding, the calculations also take into account the requirement that holders of Savings Shares are entitled to an additional dividend equal to 2% of the par value of shares above dividends paid on the Ordinary Shares. For the purpose of these calculations, the weighted average number of: · Ordinary Shares was 10,208,327,613 for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 12,283,195,845 for the year ended December 31, 2005; and · Savings Shares was 5,795,921,069 for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 5,930,204,164 for the year ended December 31, 2005. 17 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Selected Financial And Statistical Information For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares outstanding is adjusted assuming conversion of all dilutive potential shares. Potential shares are those securities that, if converted into shares, would increase the total number of shares outstanding and reduce the earnings attributable to each share. Potential shares include options, warrants and convertible securities. The Groups net income is also adjusted to reflect the impact of the conversion of potential shares net of the related tax effects. (4) Telecom Italias dividend coupons for the year ended December 31, 2005, were clipped on April 24, 2006 and were payable from April 27, 2006. (5) Share capital represents share capital issued net of the par value of treasury shares. (6) Net Financial Debt is a Non-GAAP Financial Measure as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K under the 1934 Act. For further details please see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects5.5 Results of Operations for the Two Years Ended December 31, 20055.5.2 Non-GAAP Financial Measures. (7) Excludes Minority interests. (8) In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Net income (loss) per Ordinary Share has been calculated using the two class method, since the Company has both Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares outstanding. Under this method, set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share, Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For the purpose of these calculations, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares was 3,424,694,178 for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 4,054,375,543 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The weighted average number of Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares was 6,620,513,494 and 2,414,967,112 for the year ended December 31, 2003, 10,208,327,613 and 5,795,921,069 for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 12,283,195,845 and 5,930,204,164 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The calculations take into account the requirement that holders of Savings Shares are entitled to an additional dividend equal to 2% of the par value of Savings Shares in addition to dividends paid on the ordinary shares. The calculations also take into account that in 2001 and 2002 (after the redenomination of the share capital into Euro following the resolution taken by the Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting held on July 4, 2000) the par value of Ordinary Shares was 1 per share, and that in 2003, after the Merger, the par value of Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares was reduced to 0.55 per share. For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares outstanding is increased to include any potential common shares and is adjusted for any changes to income that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares. (9) Shareholders equity under U.S. GAAP is calculated after elimination of minority interests. (10) Includes minority interests. (11) Data exclude internal lines. (12) Number of contracts. (13) Number of contracts; data include Teleconomy, Hellò and other Business voice offers. (14) Includes TACS, GSM and UMTS services, including Prepaid Customers and excludes silent lines. (15) Comprises foreign lines of the subsidiaries included in the Mobile Business Unit and excludes those of the mobile subsidiaries considered as discontinued operations/assets held for sale. 18 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Dividends 3.4 DIVIDENDS The determination of our future dividend policy, and the amounts thereof, will depend upon a number of factors, including but not limited to our earnings, financial condition and cash requirements, prospects and such other factors as may be deemed relevant at the time. Subject to the foregoing, we plan to maintain our dividend over the period 2006-2008 at a level comparable to that paid out for 2005. Dividends declared by Old Telecom Italia. The following table sets forth the dividends per Ordinary Share and per Savings Share declared by Old Telecom Italia with respect to the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, respectively, and the aggregate dividend paid in such years.

Pursuant to Italian Stock Exchange rules, dividends on the Ordinary Shares and the Savings Shares are payable from the fourth trading day after the third Friday of each month, and in any case, at least four business days after the Annual Meeting of Shareholders approving the dividends. Telecom Italias dividend coupons for the year ended December 31, 2005 were clipped on April 24, 2006, and were payable from April 27, 2006. Payment of annual dividends is subject to approval by the holders of Ordinary Shares at the annual general shareholders meeting, which must be convened within 120 days after the end of the financial year to which it relates or, in case specific reasons arise, within 180 days, the reasons for the delay to be described in the annual report. In addition, Article 21 of the Companys Bylaws gives the Board of Directors the power to approve the distribution of interim dividends. Pursuant to Italian law, the distribution may be approved after the final approval of the preceding years financial statements, and the interim dividends may not exceed the lower of (i) the difference between profits from the preceding fiscal year and amounts required to be attributed to legal and statutory reserves and (ii) available reserves. Once paid in compliance with applicable laws, shareholders cannot be required to repay interim dividends to the Company if the shareholders collected such dividends in good faith. Dividends not collected within five years from the date they become payable will be forfeited in favor of the Company. If profits are not fully distributed, additional reserves are created. 19 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Dividends According to the Italian Civil Code, before dividends may be paid with respect to any year, an amount equal to 5% of the net income of the Company for such year must be set aside to the legal reserve until the legal reserve, including amounts set aside during prior years, is at least equal to one-fifth of the par value of the Companys issued share capital. This legal reserve is not available for payment of dividends. Such restriction on the payment of dividends applies, on a non-consolidated basis, to each Italian subsidiary of the Telecom Italia Group. The Company may also pay dividends out of available retained earnings from prior years or other reserves. Dividends in respect of Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares held with Monte Titoli S.p.A (Monte Titoli) are automatically credited to the accounts of the beneficial owners with the relevant participant of Monte Titoli, without the need for presentation by such beneficial owners of any documentation. See Item 10. Additional Information10.4 Description of Capital Stock. Arrangements between Euroclear or Clearstream and Monte Titoli permit the shareholders to collect the dividends through Euroclear or Clearstream. Holders of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are entitled to receive payments in respect of dividends on the underlying Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares, as the case may be, in accordance with the relevant Deposit Agreement. Dividends payable on the Companys Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares may be subject to deduction of Italian withholding tax. See Item 10. Additional Information10.6 Taxation. Italian regulations do not contain any specific restrictions on the payment of dividends to non-residents of Italy. See Item 10. Additional Information10.2 Exchange Controls and Other Limitations Affecting Security Holders. Pursuant to Italian law, in connection with the payment of dividends, participants of Monte Titoli are required to supply to the Italian tax authorities certain information concerning the identity of non-resident shareholders holding Ordinary Shares or Savings Shares. Shareholders are required to provide their Italian tax identification number, if any, or alternatively, in the case of legal entities, their name, country of establishment and address, or in the case of individuals, their name, address and place and date of birth, or in the case of partnerships, the information required for legal entities and the information required for individuals with respect to one of their representatives. In the case of Ordinary Share ADSs and Savings Share ADSs owned by non-residents of Italy, Telecom Italia understands that the provision of information concerning the Depositary, in its capacity as holder of record of the Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares, as the case may be, will satisfy these requirements. The Depositary, in accordance with Telecom Italia, will be required to provide information to beneficial owners of Ordinary Share ADSs and Savings Share ADSs, that are considered U.S. residents for purposes of applicable law, to the extent such owners wish to benefit from reduced withholding tax rates on dividends under an income tax convention, and claims for such benefits therefore must be accompanied by the required information. See Item 10. Additional Information10.6 Taxation. 20 Table of Contents
