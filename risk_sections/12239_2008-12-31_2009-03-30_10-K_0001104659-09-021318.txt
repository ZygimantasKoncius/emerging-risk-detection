Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Any of the risk factors we describe below could severely harm our business, financial condition and operating results. The market price of our common stock could decline if one or more of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OUR SOLE DRUG CANDIDATE IS STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND REMAINS SUBJECT TO CLINICAL TESTING AND REGULATORY APPROVAL. THIS PROCESS IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND WE MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE NATURLOSE. We have limited our biotech efforts to attempting to commercialize Naturlose as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes. We are engaged in a Phase 3 clinical trial and are devoting nearly all of our available resources to this singular effort. If we are not successful, we will likely need to cease all operations. 7 WE DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BECOME A FULL SCALE BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT A NECESSARY BUYER/LICENSEE/PARTNER. We intend to continue to develop Naturlose as a viable Type 2 diabetes treatment and to continuously seek a sale, license or partner. Our hope and expectation is that as we proceed with the development, incremental successes may allow us to negotiate a favorable transaction. There can be no assurance, however, that we will have such incremental successes, or that even if we achieve them, we will attract a buyer, licensee or partner. We have limited resources and we may fully expend our funds before we are able to attract a purchaser/partner. CLINICAL TESTS ARE LONG, EXPENSIVE AND UNCERTAIN PROCESSES. IF NATURLOSE DOES NOT RECEIVE THE NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVALS, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE NATURLOSE. We have not received, and may never receive, regulatory approval for the commercial sale of Naturlose. Clinical trials are long, expensive and uncertain processes. Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically depends on the nature, complexity and novelty of the product, and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Data obtained from clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Negative or inconclusive results or medical events during a clinical trial could cause us to delay or terminate our development efforts. Furthermore, interim results of preclinical or clinical studies do not necessarily predict their final results. Clinical trials have a high risk of failure. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after achieving what appeared to be promising results in earlier trials. If we experience delays in the testing or approval process or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than originally planned, our financial results and the commercial prospects for Naturlose may be materially impaired. In addition, we have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval in the United States and abroad and, accordingly, may encounter unforeseen problems and delays in the approval process. REGULATORY AUTHORITIES MAY NOT APPROVE OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES EVEN IF THEY MEET SAFETY AND EFFICACY ENDPOINTS IN CLINICAL TRIALS. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny marketing approval for many reasons, including: · a product candidate may not be considered safe or effective; · the manufacturing processes or facilities we have selected may not meet the applicable requirements; and · changes in their approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional work on our part. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, approval for Naturlose could prevent us from ever generating meaningful revenues. Naturlose may not be approved even if it achieves endpoints in clinical trials. Regulatory agencies, including the FDA, or their advisors may disagree with our trial design and our interpretations of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials. Regulatory agencies may change requirements for approval even after a clinical trial design has been approved. Regulatory agencies may also approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested, or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of Naturlose. OUR FINANCIAL RESOURCES ARE LIMITED AND WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE TO CONTINUE OUR BUSINESS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NEEDED. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $11.3 million and expects to expend all or nearly all of this amount within the next two years. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the progress of the clinical trials and commercialization of Naturlose, as well as general and administrative costs. We will need to raise additional capital to continue our business beyond this period. The current economic downturn and its impact on the stock markets will most likely have a negative impact on our efforts to raise additional capital. We cannot ensure that additional funding will be available or, if it is available, that it can be obtained on terms and conditions we will deem acceptable. Any additional funding derived from the sale of equity securities is likely to result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders. In addition, we have received notice from the NASDAQ Stock Market that our common stock may be delisted from the NASDAQ Markets if we fail to achieve compliance with NASDAQs $1.00 minimum bid price per share requirement by late October 2009. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that may prevent us 8 from raising additional capital or may cause the terms upon which we raise additional capital, if additional capital is available, to be less favorable to us than would otherwise be the case. UNSTABLE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY HAVE SERIOUS ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES ON OUR BUSINESS. The recent economic downturn and market instability has made the business climate more volatile and more costly. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by unpredictable and unstable market conditions, including: · one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers and other partners may encounter difficulties during challenging economic times, which would directly affect our ability to attain our goals on schedule and on budget; · demand for our consulting services may decrease resulting in a decrease in revenue; · our ability to collect on trade receivables may be negatively impacted by slow payments or bad debt; · our efforts to raise additional capital may be negatively impacted; · additional funding may not be available or, if it is available, may not be on terms and conditions we deem acceptable; · any additional funding derived from the sale of equity securities is likely to result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders; and · failure to secure the necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business strategy, financial performance, and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon the clinical development plans. IF CLINICAL TRIALS OF NATURLOSE ARE PROLONGED, DELAYED OR SUSPENDED, IT MAY TAKE SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER AND COST SUBSTANTIALLY MORE TO OBTAIN APPROVAL FOR OUR DRUG CANDIDATE AND ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY, IF AT ALL. We have already encountered several challenges which have delayed our Phase 3 trial. Each delay makes it more likely that we will need interim financing to complete the Phase 3 trial. We cannot predict whether we will encounter additional problems with our trial that will cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend the clinical trial, or delay the analysis of data from the ongoing trial. Any of the following could delay the clinical development of Naturlose as a drug: · ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding the scope or design of our trial; · delays in receiving, or the inability to obtain, required approvals from reviewing entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our trial; · delays in enrolling patients into the trial; · a lower than anticipated retention rate of patients in the trial; · the need to repeat the trial as a result of inconclusive or negative results or unforeseen complications in testing; · inadequate supply or deficient quality of materials necessary to conduct our trial; · serious and unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials; · the placement by the FDA of a clinical hold on a trial; or · any restrictions on or post-approval commitments with regard to any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain that render the drug candidate not commercially viable. WE CURRENTLY RELY ON THIRD PARTIES TO CONDUCT PORTIONS OF OUR TRIAL, AND THOSE THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT PERFORM SATISFACTORILY. We rely on third parties to enroll qualified patients, conduct our trial, provide services in connection with such trial, and coordinate and oversee significant aspects of the trial. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities. Accordingly, these third party contractors may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or the trial design. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be required to replace them or we may be required to provide these services with our own personnel. Although we believe there are a number of third party contractors we could engage to continue these activities, replacing a third party contractor may result in a delay or affect the trial. If this were to occur, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our drug candidate may be delayed. WE DO NOT HAVE INTERNAL MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES, AND IF WE FAIL TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SUPPLY RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUTSIDE MANUFACTURERS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO DEVELOP OR COMMERCIALIZE NATURLOSE. Our ability to develop and commercialize 9 Naturlose will depend in part on our ability to arrange for other parties to manufacture Naturlose at a competitive cost, in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities for clinical testing and eventual commercialization. If we are unable to enter into or maintain commercial-scale manufacturing agreements on acceptable terms, or if we are unable to successfully bridge material from a manufacturer to the Arla material used in the trials, the development and commercialization of Naturlose could be delayed, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and would increase our expenses. FAILURE TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WOULD PREVENT MARKETING OF NATURLOSE. We expect to have Naturlose marketed both inside and outside of the United States. In order to market Naturlose in the European Union and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. We and our collaborators may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. The failure to obtain these approvals could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. EVEN IF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS ARE SUCCESSFUL, WE MAY NOT HAVE A COMMERCIALLY VIABLE DRUG OR PRODUCT. We have a number of hurdles to overcome to have a commercially viable drug or product even assuming our clinical trials are successful, including: · We must secure one or more manufacturers for Naturlose and we must bridge the materials supplied by the manufacturer(s) to the previously supplied Arla materials to gain FDA approval. · We must demonstrate that the product will be accepted in the market place. Even if the clinical trial is successful, the market may not accept a drug which must be consumed in powder form, three times a day, and in the quantities used in our trial. IF PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS DO NOT ACCEPT NATURLOSE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES FROM PRODUCT SALES. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for Naturlose, it may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community for a variety of reasons including: · timing of market introduction of competitive drugs; · lower demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other drugs; · lack of cost-effectiveness; · lack of availability of reimbursement from managed care plans and other third-party payors; · inconvenient and/or difficult administration; · prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; · potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; · safety concerns with similar drugs marketed by others; · the reluctance of the target population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies; and · ineffective sales, marketing and distribution support. If Naturlose fails to achieve market acceptance, we would not be able to generate significant revenue or achieve profitability. BIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS HAS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS. THE DEFENSE OF ANY PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIM BROUGHT AGAINST US WILL DIVERT MANAGEMENT TIME AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE. We could be exposed to significant potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, manufacture, sales and marketing of drugs and related products. Our insurance may not, however, provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Furthermore, product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to maintain current amounts of insurance coverage or obtain additional or sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect against losses that could have a material adverse effect on us. If a claim is brought against us, we might be required to pay legal and 10 other expenses to defend the claim, as well as uncovered damage awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us. Furthermore, whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims, we might be required to redirect significant financial and managerial resources to such defense, and adverse publicity is likely to result. OUR PATENT PROTECTION MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT US. Our current use patent for Naturlose as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes expires in 2012. We are exploring the prospects of extending the life of the patent of Naturlose for up to an additional three years. In order for the Companys request for an extension to be considered, FDA approval is needed prior to the patents expiration in 2012. There is no assurance, however, that this effort will be successful. WE HAVE SUSTAINED LOSSES IN THE PAST AND WE MAY SUSTAIN LOSSES IN THE FUTURE. We have incurred losses from continuing operations in prior years, including 2008 and 2007. Our net losses from continuing operations before taxes for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $6.2 million and $9.3 million, respectively. We expect to incur substantial losses in 2009 and thereafter until we find a purchaser/licensee. We may not return to profitable operations. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RETAIN OUR KEY EXECUTIVES AND PERSONNEL. As a small company, our success depends on the services of key employees in executive and other positions. The loss of the services of one or more of such employees could have a material adverse effect on us. WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION BY COMPETITORS. Our competitors in the biotechnology products business are numerous. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. Our competitors may succeed in developing or marketing biotechnology products that are more effective than ours. RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK THE PRICE OF SPHERIXS COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN HIGHLY VOLATILE DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK. Our common stock has traded as low as $0.20 and as high as $1.30 between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2008. Some of the factors leading to this volatility include: · relatively small amounts of our stock trading on any given day; · fluctuations in our operating results; · announcements of technological innovations or new products which we or our competitors make; · developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights; and · recent economic downturn and market instability. OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE DELISTED FROM NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET SYSTEM IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH CONTINUED LISTING STANDARDS. On July 21, 2008, we were advised that we were in danger of our common stock being delisted from the NASDAQ due to failing to meet the minimum $1 per share stock price requirement. Spherix has until late October 2009 to regain compliance. The Company can achieve compliance at any time during this period if the bid price of its common stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive business days. If the Company does not regain compliance with this rule by late October 2009, NASDAQ will provide notice to the Company that its common stock will be delisted from NASDAQ and the Company will have an opportunity to appeal the determination. On November 17, 2008, the stockholders of Spherix authorized a reverse split of the Companys common stock within a range of 1:5 to 1:20. Accordingly, the Board of Directors has the authority, at any time until mid-November 2009, to determine whether and when to implement a reverse stock split and the actual ratio of such a split within the 1:5 to 1:20 range. It is expected that the Board of Directors will defer a decision on the reverse stock split until the third quarter of 2009. The Company will also be delisted if its stockholders equity falls below the $2.5 million minimum requirement of the NASDAQ Capital Market. At December 31, 2008, the Companys shareholders equity was $10.4 million. DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK ARE NOT LIKELY. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, in order to provide funds for use in the operation and expansion of our business and for further research and development. Accordingly, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. 11 Investors must look solely to appreciation in the market price of the shares of our common stock to obtain a return on their investment. BECAUSE OF THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT AND ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS, A THIRD PARTY MAY BE DISCOURAGED FROM MAKING A TAKEOVER OFFER WHICH COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. In 2001, we adopted a shareholder rights plan. The effect of this rights plan and of certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us or replacing members of our board of directors, even if the acquisition or the replacements would be beneficial to our stockholders. These factors could also reduce the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of the common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions. INSIDERS OWN A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH COULD LIMIT OUR STOCKHOLDERS ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF KEY TRANSACTIONS. As of December 31, 2008, our officers and directors and their affiliates owned approximately 18% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, our officers and directors are able to exert considerable influence over the outcome of any matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock, including the election of our Board of Directors. The voting power of these stockholders could prevent or frustrate attempts to effect a transaction that is in the best interests of the other stockholders and could also discourage others from seeking to purchase our common stock, which might depress the price of our common stock.
