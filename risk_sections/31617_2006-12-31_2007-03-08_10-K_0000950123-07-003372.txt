ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS REDUCTIONS IN GOVERNMENT SPENDING WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. A reduction in purchases of our products by domestic and foreign government agencies would have a material adverse effect on our business because a significant portion of our net sales are derived from contracts directly or indirectly with government agencies. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we derived about 81%, 82% and 79%, respectively, of net sales from direct and indirect contracts with the U.S. Government and derived about 15%, 14% and 14%, respectively, of net sales from international sales to foreign governments. The development of our business will depend upon the continued willingness of the U.S. and foreign governments to fund existing and new defense programs and, in particular, to continue to purchase our products and services. Although defense spending in the 13 United States has recently increased, further increases may not continue and any proposed budget or supplemental budget request may not be approved. In addition, the U.S. Department of Defense may not continue to focus its spending on technologies that we incorporate in our products. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MAY TERMINATE OR MODIFY OUR EXISTING CONTRACTS OR ITS CONTRACTS WITH THE PRIME CONTRACTORS FOR WHICH WE ARE A SUBCONTRACTOR, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. A significant portion of our revenues are derived from U.S. Government contracts, directly or indirectly. There are inherent risks in contracting with the U.S. Government, including risks unique to the defense industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Laws and regulations permit the U.S. Government to: - terminate contracts for its convenience; - reduce or modify contracts or subcontracts if its requirements or budgetary constraints change; - cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable; - adjust contract costs and fees on the basis of audits done by its agencies; and - control or prohibit the export of our products. If the U.S. Government terminates our contracts for convenience, we may only recover our costs incurred or committed for settlement expenses and profit on work completed before the termination. Additionally, most of our backlog could be adversely affected by any modification or termination of contracts with the U.S. Government or contracts the prime contractors have with the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government regularly reviews our costs and performance on its contracts, as well as our accounting and general business practices. The U.S. Government may reduce the reimbursement for our fees and contract-related costs as a result of an audit. OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RESTRICTIVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS BECAUSE WE ARE A CONTRACTOR AND SUBCONTRACTOR TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND BECAUSE WE PROVIDE MILITARY PRODUCTS TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. As a contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. Government, we are subject to various laws and regulations that are more restrictive than those applicable to non-government contractors. We are required to obtain and maintain material governmental authorizations and approvals to run our business as it is currently conducted. For example, we require a license to operate an FAA repair station. Because we provide defense products and related services to foreign governments, we must obtain export licenses from the U.S. Department of State. Our failure or inability to obtain these licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business. New or more stringent laws or government regulations concerning government contracts and defense exports, if adopted and enacted, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Responding to governmental audits, inquiries or investigations may involve significant expense and divert management attention from regular operations. Also, an adverse finding in any such audit, inquiry or investigation could involve debarment, fines, injunctions or other sanctions. IF WE FAIL TO WIN COMPETITIVELY AWARDED CONTRACTS IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY EXPERIENCE A REDUCTION IN OUR SALES, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. We obtain many of our U.S. Government contracts through a competitive bidding process. We cannot assure you that we will continue to win competitively awarded contracts or that awarded contracts will generate sales sufficient to result in our profitability. We are also subject to risks associated with the following: - the frequent need to bid on programs in advance of the completion of their design (which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns); - the substantial time and effort, including the relatively unproductive design and development required to prepare bids and proposals, spent for competitively awarded contracts that may not be awarded to us; 14 - design complexity and rapid technological obsolescence; and - the constant need for design improvement. Our government contracts may be subject to protest or challenge by unsuccessful bidders or to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending or other factors. In addition, failure to obtain a renewal or follow-on contract with respect to any significant contract or a number of lesser contracts with the U.S. Government or foreign governments would result in a loss of revenues. If revenues from the award of new contracts fail to offset this loss, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. A LARGE MAJORITY OF OUR CONTRACTS ARE FIXED-PRICE, AND WE MAY FACE INCREASED RISKS OF COST OVERRUNS OR LOSSES ON OUR CONTRACTS. The majority of our government contracts and subcontracts are firm, fixed- price contracts providing for a predetermined fixed price for the products we make regardless of the costs we incur. At times, we must therefore make pricing commitments to our customers based on our expectation that we will achieve more cost-effective product designs and automate more of our manufacturing operations. The manufacture of our products requires a complex integration of demanding processes involving unique technical skill sets. In addition, the expense of producing products can rise due to increased costs of materials, components, labor, capital equipment or other factors. As a result, we face risks of cost overruns or order cancellations if we fail to achieve forecasted product design and manufacturing efficiencies or if products cost more to produce than expected. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REDUCE OUR PROFIT MARGINS ON CONTRACTS ON WHICH WE USE THE PERCENTAGE-OF- COMPLETION ACCOUNTING METHOD. We record sales and profits on many of our contracts using percentage-of- completion methods of accounting. As a result, revisions made to our estimates of sales and profits are recorded in the period in which the conditions that require such revisions become known and can be estimated. Although we believe that our profit margins are fairly stated and that adequate provisions for losses for our fixed price contracts are recorded in our financial statements, as required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we cannot assure you that our contract profit margins will not decrease or our loss provisions will not increase materially in the future. OUR PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS MAY BE RENDERED OBSOLETE BY OUR INABILITY TO ADAPT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. The rapid change of technology continually affects our product applications and may directly impact the performance of our products. For our electronic warfare products, we are required to improve reliability and maintainability, extend frequency ranges and provide advanced jamming techniques. We can give you no assurances that we will successfully maintain or improve the effectiveness of our existing products, nor can we assure you that we will successfully identify new opportunities and continue to have the needed financial resources to develop new products in a timely or cost-effective manner. In addition, products manufactured by others may render our products and systems obsolete or non- competitive. If any of these events occur, our results of operations would be adversely affected. THE UNSUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION OF A BUSINESS OR BUSINESS SEGMENT WE ACQUIRE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS. One of our key operating strategies is to pursue selective acquisitions. We review and actively pursue possible acquisitions on a continuous basis. Our acquisition strategy may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership. We cannot assure you that any future acquisition will be consummated, or that if consummated, we will be able to integrate such acquisition successfully without a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, any acquisition could involve other risks, including: - diversion of management's attention from existing operations; - potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired companies; and 15 - exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies. WE ARE DEPENDENT IN PART UPON OUR RELATIONSHIPS AND ALLIANCES WITH INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS IN ORDER TO GENERATE REVENUE. We rely on the strength of our relationships with other contractors to form strategic alliances. Some of our partners assist us in the development of some of our products through teaming arrangements. Under these teaming arrangements, our partners usually have borne a portion of the expenses associated with our research and development of new and existing products that are the subject of such agreements. We cannot assure you that our partners will continue to bear these expenses in the future. If any of our existing relationships with our partners were impaired or terminated, we could experience significant delays in the development of our new products ourselves, and we would incur additional development costs. We would need to fund these costs internally or identify new partners. Some of our partners are also potential competitors, which may impair the viability of new strategic relationships. While we must compete effectively in the marketplace, our future alliances may depend on our partners' perception of us. Our ability to win new and/or follow-on contracts may be dependent upon our relationships within the military industry. WE HAVE DEVELOPED OUTSOURCING ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF MANY OF THE COMPONENTS AND SUB-ASSEMBLIES OF OUR PRODUCTS. IF THIRD PARTIES FAIL TO DELIVER QUALITY PRODUCTS AND COMPONENTS AT REASONABLE PRICES ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE MAY ALIENATE SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR REVENUES, PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOW MAY DECLINE. We use contract manufacturers as an alternative to our own manufacture of the components and sub-assemblies of our products. If these contract manufacturers are not willing to contract with us on competitive terms or devote adequate resources to fulfill their obligations to us, or we do not properly manage these relationships, our existing customer relationships may suffer. In addition, by undertaking these activities, we run the risks that - the reputation and competitiveness of our products and services may deteriorate as a result of the reduction of our control and quality and delivery schedules and the consequent risk that we will experience supply interruptions and be subject to escalating costs; and - our competitiveness may be harmed by the failure of our contract manufacturers to develop, implement or maintain manufacturing methods appropriate for our products and customers. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO DEFEND LAWSUITS OR PAY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE ALLEGED OR ACTUAL HARM CAUSED BY OUR PRODUCTS. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of some of our products is alleged to have resulted in unintended harm to others or to property. Although we maintain general liability and product liability insurance, we may incur significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful. We cannot assure you that such coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise or that it will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms. WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY ARISING FROM OUR ACTIVITIES INVOLVING THE USE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. Our business is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. From time to time, our operations have resulted or may result in noncompliance with environmental laws or liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up, and certain damages resulting from, sites of past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous materials. In addition, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party pursuant to the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, or corresponding state environmental laws, for the cleanup of contamination resulting from past disposals of hazardous materials at some sites where we, along with others, sent waste in the past. We are a party to consent decrees as a result of our 16 potential responsibility for contamination caused by the disposal of hazardous materials. We cannot assure you that such matters, or any similar liabilities that arise in the future, will not exceed our resources, nor can we completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN FOREIGN MARKETS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS. Foreign sales represented about 15% of our net sales in 2006 and we intend to increase the amount of foreign sales we make in the future. Foreign sales are subject to numerous risks, including political and economic instability in foreign markets, restrictive trade policies of foreign governments, economic conditions in local markets, inconsistent product regulation by foreign agencies or governments, the imposition of product tariffs and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of international and U.S. export laws and differing regulatory requirements. If we fail to increase our foreign sales it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. CONCENTRATION OF VOTING POWER AND CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS COULD MAKE A MERGER, TENDER OFFER OR PROXY CONTEST DIFFICULT AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES. At December 31, 2006, the EDO Employee Stock Ownership Trust, or ESOT, owned 3,560,762 common shares (or about 17% of the outstanding common shares). The trustee of the plan has obligations under the trust agreement and its fiduciary duties when voting allocated shares under the plan. The procedure the trustee generally follows is to receive direction from each of the plan participants with respect to his or her allocated shares, and then to vote all shares in accordance with the direction received. The market may perceive that the concentration of voting power in the hands of a single employee stock ownership plan creates a potential barrier against another party acquiring us. This perception could result in lower market prices for our common shares. In addition, certain agreements to which we are a party, including note and executive officer agreements, contain provisions that impose increased costs in the event of a change of control. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ADEQUATELY, THE VALUE OF OUR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS COULD BE DIMINISHED. The value of our commercial products is increased, in part, by obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents and other proprietary rights. While we take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part on patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws, we cannot assure you that the precautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectual property rights. In the event a competitor successfully challenges our patents or licenses, we could incur substantial litigation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S RIGHT TO USE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED BY US LIMITS OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. We seek to protect the competitive benefits we derive from our patents, proprietary information and other intellectual property. However, we do not have the right to prohibit the U.S. Government from using certain technologies developed or acquired by us or to prohibit third party companies, including our competitors, from using those technologies in providing products and services to the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government has the right to royalty-free use of technologies that we have developed under U.S. Government contracts. We are free to commercially exploit those government-funded technologies and may assert our intellectual property rights to seek to block other non-government users thereof, but we cannot assure you we could successfully do so. A FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TECHNICAL PERSONNEL COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND OUR OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS. There is a continuing demand for qualified technical personnel, and we believe that our future growth and success will depend upon our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel. Competition for personnel in the military industry is intense, and there are a limited number of persons with knowledge of, and experience in, this industry. Although we currently experience relatively low rates of turnover for our technical personnel, the rate of turnover may increase in the future. An inability to attract or maintain a sufficient number of technical personnel 17 could have a material adverse effect on our contract performance or on our ability to capitalize on market opportunities. INCREASED SCRUTINY OF FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, AND ANY RESTATEMENT OF EARNINGS COULD INCREASE LITIGATION RISKS AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS. Congress, the SEC, other regulatory authorities and the media are intensely scrutinizing a number of financial reporting issues and practices. Although all businesses face uncertainty with respect to how the U.S. financial disclosure regime may be affected by this process, particular attention has been focused recently on companies' interpretations of generally accepted accounting principles. If we are required to restate our financial statements as a result of a determination that we had incorrectly applied generally accepted accounting principles, that restatement could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets or the trading price of our securities. The recent scrutiny regarding financial reporting may also result in an increase in litigation involving companies with publicly traded securities, such as us. There can be no assurance that any such litigation against us would not materially adversely affect our business or the trading price of our securities. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE RESTRICTIONS AND COVENANTS IN OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS, THERE WOULD BE A DEFAULT UNDER THE TERMS OF THOSE AGREEMENTS, AND THIS COULD RESULT IN AN ACCELERATION OF PAYMENT OF FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN BORROWED. If we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, there would be a default under the terms of these agreements. Some of the debt agreements also require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial tests. Our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control, including, without limitation, sales levels, contract terminations and potential acquisitions. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet these tests. In the event of a default under these agreements, the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend or accelerate the loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. Borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions may also be accelerated and become due and payable. If any of these events occur, there can be no assurance that we would be able to make necessary payments to the lenders or that we would be able to find alternative financing. Even if we are able to obtain alternative financing, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. RESTRICTIONS AND COVENANTS IN OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND COULD PREVENT US FROM OBTAINING NEEDED FUNDS IN THE FUTURE. Our debt and financing arrangements contain a number of significant limitations that restrict our ability to, among other things: - borrow additional money or issue guarantees; - pay dividends or other distributions to shareholders; - make investments; - create liens on assets; - sell assets; - enter into transactions with affiliates; and - engage in mergers or consolidations. These restrictions may limit our ability to obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a future downturn in business or the economy. 18 ITEM 1B.
