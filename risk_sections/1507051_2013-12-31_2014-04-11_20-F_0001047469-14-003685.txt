This annual report contains translations of RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. The exchange rate refers to the exchange rate as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from RMB to U.S. dollars were made at a rate of RMB6.0537 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate set forth as of December 31, 2013. No representation is made that the RMB amounts referred to in this annual report could have been or could be converted into U.S. dollars at any particular rate or at all. The PRC government imposes control over its foreign currency reserves in part through direct regulation of the conversion of RMB into foreign exchange and through restrictions on foreign trade. On April 4, 2014, the exchange rate was RMB6.2118 to US$1.00. The following table sets forth information concerning exchange rates between the RMB and the U.S. dollar for the periods indicated. These rates are provided solely for your convenience and are not necessarily the exchange rates that we used in this annual report or will use in the preparation of our periodic reports or any other information to be provided to you.

We may experience net losses or earnings declines in the future and we may not sustain our historical revenue growth rate or profitability. We commercially launched our first virtual world, Mole's World, in September 2008. Our limited operating history may not be able to provide a meaningful basis for you to evaluate our business. It is also difficult to evaluate our prospective business, because we may not have sufficient experience to address the risks frequently encountered by early stage companies operating in a new and rapidly evolving industry, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations. These risks may include our potential failure to: retain existing users and attract new users; develop, license, or acquire additional virtual worlds that are appealing to users; anticipate and adapt to changing user preferences; adapt to competitive market conditions; timely respond to technological changes or resolve unexpected network interruptions; adequately and efficiently operate, upgrade and develop our online entertainment community; maintain adequate control of our expenses; and attract and retain qualified personnel. Our net revenues amounted to US$45.4 million in 2011, decreased to US$40.2 million in 2012 and increased to US$48.4 million in 2013. We may not be able to achieve or sustain our revenue growth in future periods and we cannot assure you that we will not incur net losses in the future due to a number of factors, including, among others, economic factors out of our control, competition in the children's entertainment industry in China, in which market share can be quickly acquired or lost, the greater difficulty of growing at sustained rates from a larger net revenue base, and adjustment to our strategic decision in response to changing circumstances that emphasize long-term influence over short-term growth. We also expect that our total operating expenses will increase in absolute amount as we further grow our business. We incur substantial costs and expenses to develop, market and operate a virtual world and may not collect revenues in connection with the virtual world for some time after its commercial launch or at all. We may not succeed in our expansion in the offline business. Any failure or delay in generating revenues could result in material operating losses and harm our financial condition. Accordingly, you should not rely on the results of any prior period as an indication of our future operating performance. As we currently depend on a limited number of virtual worlds for substantially all of our revenues, if any of these virtual worlds incur any adverse developments or if we are unable to develop, purchase or license additional virtual worlds that are attractive to users and result in overall revenue growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Our virtual worlds, Seer Series, Gong Fu Pai and Flower Fairy, contributed to the majority of our revenues in 2013. We anticipate that these and other existing virtual worlds of ours will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues in the near term. Accordingly, any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations: failure by us to make quality upgrades, enhancements or improvements to the existing virtual worlds in a timely manner; delay in or discontinuation of regular content updates; 6 Table of Contents any reduction in or failure to grow the user base of these existing virtual worlds, any decrease in their popularity in the market due to intensifying competition or other factors; any decrease in or failure to grow the amount of revenues generated from the existing virtual worlds; or any breach of virtual world related software security, prolonged server interruption due to network failures, hacking activities or other factors or any other adverse developments relating to our existing virtual worlds. We entered into revenue sharing agreements with third-party game developers, and primarily collect payments from game players in connection with the sale of in-game currencies and remit certain agreed-upon percentages of the proceeds to the game developers and record revenue net of remittances. Purchases of in-game currency are not refundable after they have been sold unless there is unused in-game currency at the time a game is discontinued. Typically, a game will be discontinued when the monthly revenue generated by a game is insignificant. We make our effort to help the game players eliminate their loss before a game is discontinued to avoid paying cash refunds to game players or game developers as a result of discontinuation of a game, or for any other reason. However, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to pay such cash refunds in the future, which may have adverse effect on our revenues. In addition, in order to achieve our long-term profitability and financial and operational success, we must continually develop, purchase or license new virtual worlds that are attractive to users. Although we currently have new virtual worlds in development, they may not be released on time, may not be profitable or popular among children in China. The success of our internally developed virtual worlds will require additional investment prior to commercial launch. Furthermore, our ability to purchase or license successful virtual worlds will depend on their availability on acceptable terms, including price, our ability to compete effectively against other potential purchasers or licensees to attract the developers of these virtual worlds, and our ability to obtain government approvals required for the purchase or licensing and operation of these virtual worlds. The virtual worlds that we develop, purchase or license may not be attractive to users, may be viewed by the regulatory authorities as not complying with content restrictions, may not be launched as scheduled or may not compete effectively with our competitors' products. For example, we incurred impairment of intangible assets of US$1.0 million in 2013, related to the write-off of the remaining term of two underperforming games, Wizard 101, a game for which we obtained a three-year exclusive license in 2011 and commercially launched in the third quarter of 2012, and Speed Hunter, a game for which we obtained a five-year exclusive license right in 2012 and commercially launched in the third quarter of 2013. If we are not able to successfully develop, purchase or license virtual worlds appealing to users, our future profitability and growth prospects could decline. We may not be able to maintain our revenues and profitability as we operate in a competitive industry and compete against many companies. We believe that there are a number of competing developers and operators in China providing online and offline entertainment to children. Given the relatively low capital requirements and entry barriers, we expect more companies to enter the children's entertainment industry in China. For example, our competitors could introduce a wide range of virtual worlds targeting children to the China market in a relatively short period of time. We believe our principal competitors in online children's entertainment in China include Tencent Holdings Limited, or Tencent, the developer of Roco Kingdom and Guangzhou Baitian Information Technology Ltd., the developer of Aola Star and Aobi Island. Potential competitors also include major Internet portal operators, other domestic and foreign virtual 7 Table of Contents world developers and operators, media companies focused on children's entertainment and alliances between our existing and new competitors. Some of our competitors, especially major foreign and China-based publicly listed media and virtual world operators, have significantly greater financial and marketing resources and name recognition than we have. We also face competition on the mobile front with respect to mobile applications, as there are an increasing number of Internet companies in China tapping into the mobile market with applications and services targeting children. We also face these and other competitors in our offline business, including Guangdong Alpha Animation and Culture Co., Ltd, a company listed in Shenzhen Stock Exchange which primarily engages in toy and animation industry (Ticker: 002292). Our competitors may adopt loss-leading pricing or other tactics or business models, and if these prove to be more attractive to children on a temporary or permanent basis, our users may switch to our competitors' services and products at our expense. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any new or existing competitors, or maintain our user base and number of active paying accounts when competitors launch promotional campaigns targeting our user base, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. We face risks and uncertainties regarding the growth of the online entertainment industry for children and market acceptance of our online products and services. The online entertainment industry for children in China, from which we currently derive most of our revenues, is a relatively new and evolving industry and concept. The growth of the online entertainment industry for children and the level of demand and market acceptance of our virtual worlds and other online products and services are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Our future operating results will depend on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include: the growth of personal computer, mobile devices, Internet and broadband users and penetration in China and other markets in which we offer our virtual worlds, and the rate of any such growth; whether the online entertainment market in China, and in particular the online entertainment market for children, continues to grow and the rate of any such growth; general economic conditions, particularly economic conditions adversely affecting discretionary spending on children's entertainment; the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment, particularly console system games; and our ability to create new digital entertainment products appealing to our users, including the ability to timely update our existing virtual worlds and other services and introduce new virtual worlds and other services that attract existing and new users. If we fail to anticipate and effectively manage these risks and uncertainties, our market share may decrease, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Our digital entertainment products and services including new virtual worlds and mobile applications may attract our users away from our established virtual worlds, and enhancements and updates to our established virtual worlds may result in certain users deciding not to participate in them, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our digital entertainment products and service including new virtual worlds and mobile applications may attract our users away from our established virtual worlds, particularly with respect to virtual worlds with similar story lines. Although we intend to target different types of users with new virtual worlds and therefore minimize users of our existing virtual worlds migrating to later launched 8 Table of Contents virtual worlds, such movement may nevertheless occur and may lead to fewer active users, reduced network effect and lower spending on subscriptions and virtual items. In addition, in order to retain our existing users and to attract new users, we periodically introduce new features and make changes to our established virtual worlds based on feedback gathered from our users. However, these changes may result in some of our existing users deciding not to participate in our virtual worlds, either temporarily or permanently. Our users may not respond well to enhancements to our virtual worlds or policy changes in our online entertainment community, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have no control over our distributors or licensees except through agreements we entered into with them. Our brands and reputation could be harmed and our results of operations could suffer if our distributors or licensees fail to comply with our agreements with them. We rely on our distributors to distribute our prepaid cards, through which our users pay subscription fees and purchase online virtual items. We also rely on our licensees to manufacture and distribute products, including interactive toys, of our licensed franchises. We have limited ability to manage the activities of our distributors and licensees, who are independent from us, except through the enforcement of agreements with them. If a significant number of our distributors or licensees fail to comply with our agreements with them, such as distribution targets, brand and service promotion arrangements, quality control standards, or protocols on approving the presentation or portrayal of our franchises, our brands and reputation could be harmed and our results of operations could suffer as a result. We may not be successful in effectively promoting our brand or enhancing our brand recognition, and any negative publicity, regardless of its veracity, may harm our brand. Promoting the "Taomee" brand and enhancing its recognition as a family-friendly brand dedicated to children's entertainment is an integral part of our growth strategy. There is no assurance that we will be able to effectively promote or develop our brand and if we fail to do so, our growth may be adversely affected. In addition, negative publicity or disputes regarding our brand, products and services, company or management could materially and adversely affect public perception of our brand and the virtual worlds and other products and services we offer. Any negative publicity in relation to our services or products, regardless of its veracity, could harm our brand image among children and their parents and, in turn, result in decreases in the number of users and average net revenues per paying account from the operation of our online business. Any impact on our ability to effectively promote our brand and any significant damage to the public perception of the "Taomee" brand or our virtual worlds could materially and adversely affect our prospects and results of operations. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by our distributors, licensees or third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may harm our brands and reputation and adversely affect our business. We regard our copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property as important to our success. Unauthorized use of our intellectual properties may harm our brands and reputation and adversely affect our business. We have historically relied on a combination of trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection, restrictions on disclosure and other agreements that restrict the use of our intellectual properties to protect our intellectual property rights. Although our contracts with distributors and licensees prohibit the unauthorized use of our franchises, brands and other intellectual property rights, we cannot assure you that they will always comply with these terms. Although we presently enter into confidentiality agreements with most of our employees, we cannot assure you that these confidentiality 9 Table of Contents agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our proprietary technology, know-how or other intellectual property will not otherwise become known to, or be independently developed by, third parties. As of December 31, 2013, we had received approval for 351 and 7 trademark registrations in China and Taiwan, respectively, and are in the process of applying for registration of an additional 46 trademarks in China. In addition, we have obtained 69 copyright registrations for software we developed, 4 copyright registrations for Mole's World and Seer animation series and 392 copyright registrations for artworks owned by us. We also registered 39 domain names, including www.61.com, our primary operation website. While we actively take steps to protect our proprietary rights, such steps may not be adequate to prevent the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property. In addition, we cannot assure you that any of the above trademark applications will ultimately proceed to registration or will result in registration with adequate scope for our business. Some of our pending applications or registrations may be successfully challenged or invalidated by others. If our trademark applications are not successful, we may have to use different marks for affected products or services, or seek to enter into arrangements with any third parties who may have prior registrations, applications or rights, which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Implementation of intellectual property laws in China has historically been lacking, primarily because of ambiguities in the laws and difficulties in enforcement. Accordingly, intellectual property right protection in China may not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary technology, trademarks and other intellectual property is difficult and expensive, and litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. Future litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, and could disrupt our business, as well as have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on our nationwide prepaid card distribution network, merchandise licensees, interactive toy distributors and film distributors for a significant portion of our net revenues. If we fail to effectively manage our distributor and licensee relationships or our distributors and licensees fail to adhere to our agreements with them, our results of operations could suffer as a result. We rely on a number of provincial and regional distributors to sell our prepaid cards. Online payment systems in China are still in a relatively early stage of development and are not as widely acceptable to users in China as compared to the United States. Also, compared to adult online users, children have fewer means to make payment through online payment channels. As a result, although we make our prepaid cards available for purchase online using an online payment system, our business is dependent on the performance of our regional distributors. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, 80.3%, 73.9% and 71.9%, respectively, of our net sales proceeds collected were from the sales of prepaid cards to our distributors, respectively. Our largest distributor accounted for 10.3%, 9.8% and 7.4% of our net sales proceeds generated from prepaid card sales in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Although we typically enter into semi-annual contracts with and provide performance based incentives to our distributors, our distribution agreements are not exclusive and do not prohibit our distributors from selling our competitors' game cards. Maintaining relationships with a significant number of distributors may be difficult and time-consuming. If we fail to maintain good relationships with, or to effectively manage, our distributors, if these new distributors may not strictly adhere to our agreements with them or provide targeted distribution in locations frequented by target users, or if the distributors promote our competitors' service and products at our expense, our results of operations could suffer as a result. We also rely on our licensees and distributors to distribute our merchandises and interactive toys. We sell a vast majority of our products in China through our licensees and distributors, who in turn sell our products to consumers through retail stores directly operated by them or by their sub-distributors. Our distributors are not contractually obligated to work with us on an exclusive basis. In addition, some of our distributors may sell products that compete with our products. Our dependence on distributors 10 Table of Contents increases their bargaining power with us and the need for us to maintain good relationships with them. To the extent that any material distributor ceases to cooperate with us for any reason and we are not able to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we may lose significant business. In addition, we may have to offer volume-based discounts or more favorable credit terms to our distributors in the future, which may lower our operating profit. As we rely to a large extent on our distributors for the sale of our products, our future growth will also depend on the performance of our distributors and their ability to expand their business and sales networks. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew our distribution agreements or renew such agreements on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, there is no assurance that one or more of our major distributors will not breach their distribution agreements or fail to comply with their obligations thereunder. In such event or events, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We also rely on our film distributors to release our featured films. Film distributors act as intermediaries between film producers and movie theater operators. As a result, the releases of our films depend on maintaining relationships with these film distributors. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these relationships and that film distributors will continue to enter into arrangements with us on favorable terms or at all. In addition, any deterioration in our relationships with the film distributors could require us to enter into arrangements with alternative film distributors. If alternative film distributors do not provide us with comparable services at favorable terms or at all, we may not be able to release our films, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if any film distributor breaches the contracts with us and fails to pay us the film box office sharing, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Unauthorized character enhancements, other hacking or cheating activities, and undetected programming errors or defects in our virtual worlds could harm our online business and reputation and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. With the increase in the number of virtual world users in China, virtual world operators have increasingly encountered problems arising from the use of unauthorized character enhancements, theft of user account passwords and other hacking or cheating activities. We have from time to time detected a number of users who have gained an unfair advantage by installing hacking or cheating tools to facilitate character progression. In response to these activities, we have installed detection mechanisms in our virtual worlds to identify various hacking and cheating activities, and have expanded our technical team dedicated to detecting unauthorized character enhancements and resolving other hacking issues. In addition, our virtual worlds may contain undetected programming errors or other defects. Continued occurrences of unauthorized character enhancements, other hacking or cheating activities, and undetected errors or defects in our virtual worlds may negatively impact the image of our virtual worlds and users' perception of their reliability, decrease the number of users, reduce the users' interest in purchasing virtual items, shorten the life span of the virtual worlds and adversely affect our results of operations. A constant recurrence of these activities may require us to shift our management's and personnel's attention from research and development and other operations to focus instead primarily on anti-hacking programs and activities, which could hurt our ability to develop and launch new virtual worlds and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 11 Table of Contents If we fail to successfully execute our growth strategies, including our current expansion into film and merchandise sales, our future results of operations and growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected. As part of our growth strategy, we have expanded from the online business to the offline business, such as film, interactive toys and other licensed products. Expansion into these or other new businesses or adoption of other new business models present operating and marketing challenges that are different from those that we encounter in our online business. We face competition from existing players within these markets who may have more experience and resources. We may need to satisfy different regulatory requirements and obtain additional licenses or permits from relevant regulatory authorities. If we cannot successfully address these new challenges and compete effectively in these markets or under these business models, we may not be able to operate these offline businesses, attract a sufficiently large number of audience or customers, or recover costs incurred for developing and marketing these products or services, and our future results of operations and growth strategies could be materially and adversely affected as a result. Pursuing these and other growth strategies in our offline business may also require us to expand our operations through internal development efforts and through partnerships, joint ventures, investments and acquisitions. If we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategies, our revenue and profitability may not grow as we expect, and our competitiveness may be materially and adversely affected. We may undertake acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or other strategic alliances, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. In addition, such undertakings may not be successful. Our strategy includes plans to grow both organically and through acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic alliances. Joint ventures and strategic alliances may expose us to new operational, regulatory and market risks, as well as risks associated with additional capital requirements. We may not be able to identify suitable future acquisition candidates or alliance partners. Even if we identify suitable candidates or partners, we may be unable to complete an acquisition or alliance on terms commercially acceptable to us. If we fail to identify appropriate candidates or partners, or complete desired acquisitions, we may not be able to implement our strategies effectively or efficiently. In addition, our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies may be adversely affected by a number of factors. These factors include diversion of management's attention, difficulties in retaining personnel of the acquired companies, unanticipated legal liabilities, and tax and accounting issues in association with the acquisition and business combination. If we fail to integrate acquired companies efficiently, our earnings, revenues growth and business could be negatively affected. Furthermore, the acquired companies may not perform to our expectations for various reasons, including legislative or regulatory changes that affect the acquired companies' operations, and the loss of personnel. If we are not able to realize the benefits envisioned for such acquisitions, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. For example, in 2013, we made an impairment of US$0.4 in our investment in Chuangyou, due to Chuangyou's deteriorating financial position and performance. We may not be able to obtain the land use rights and building ownership right in Songjiang, Shanghai in a timely manner and we may not successfully recover our prepayment thereunder, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In May 2013, we entered into a land pre-development cooperation agreement with respect to our intention to purchase the land use rights of two parcels with an aggregated area of approximately 23,300 square meters in Songjiang District, Shanghai for a total consideration of RMB8.8 million (US$1.5 million). A prepayment of RMB4.4 million (US$0.7 million) was paid in May 2013. In August 12 Table of Contents 2013, we entered into a letter of intent with respect to our intention to purchase a building with an aggregated construction area of approximately 4,860 square meters in Songjiang District, Shanghai for a total consideration of RMB46.6 million (US$7.7 million). A prepayment of RMB14.0 million (US$2.3 million) was paid as of December 31, 2013. Pursuant to the agreements we have entered into with the parties thereto, we will be fully refunded of the prepayments of RMB18.4 million (US$3.0 million) if we fail to obtain the land use rights and the building. Our execution of a definite land use rights and building purchase agreement and payment of the remaining consideration are contingent upon relevant PRC government authorities' approval. If we fail to obtain the land use rights and the building, we rely on the government credit for the refund of our prepayment. We believe the risk of the government to breach its covenants is remote, however, if we have difficulty recovering the balance of the deposits we have paid, we may be obliged to record provisions for impairment loss for all or part of our prepayments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our limited resources may affect our ability to manage our growth. Our growth to date has placed, and our anticipated further expansion will continue to place, a strain on our management, systems and resources. To accommodate our growth pursuant to our strategies, we implemented and maintained and will continue to accommodate a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, as well as our accounting and other internal management systems, all of which require substantial management efforts. We also will need to continue to expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce, and manage our relationships with our users, our distributors and third-party product and service providers. All of these endeavors will require substantial management effort and skill and the incurrence of additional expenditures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to efficiently or effectively implement our growth strategies and manage the growth of our operations, and any failure to do so may limit our future growth and hamper our business strategy. Our failure to anticipate or successfully implement new technologies could render our game engines, development platforms or virtual worlds unattractive or obsolete, and reduce our revenues and market share. Our proprietary engines for powering our virtual worlds, online games, and mobile applications, our flexible and secure software framework and anti-cheating expertise are critical to our success. Our industry is subject to rapid technological changes. We need to anticipate the emergence of new technologies and assess their market acceptance. We also need to invest significant resources, including financial resources, in research and development to keep pace with technological advances in order to make our development capabilities and our virtual worlds competitive in the market. However, development activities are inherently uncertain, and we might encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our development results. Our significant expenditures on research and development may not generate corresponding benefits. Given the fast pace with which virtual world technology has been and will continue to be developed, we may not be able to timely upgrade our engines or the software framework for our virtual world development in an efficient and cost-effective manner, or at all. New technologies in virtual world programming or operations could render our technologies, our existing virtual worlds or the virtual worlds that we are developing or expect to develop in the future obsolete or unattractive, thereby limiting our ability to recover related product development costs, purchase costs and/or licensing fees, which could result in a decline in our revenues and market share. 13 Table of Contents We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which could be time-consuming and costly to defend and may result in diversion of our financial and management resources and our inability to continue providing some of our existing virtual worlds. We cannot assure you that our franchise characters, our plots, or other content posted on our websites or made available through our video site or our partners' site, has not infringed or will not infringe upon patents, valid copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of our business within the relevant statute of limitation. If we are found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others, we may be enjoined from using such intellectual property, be forced to pay fines and damages, and we may incur licensing fees or be forced to develop alternatives. In addition, we may incur substantial expenses and diversion of our financial and management resources in defending against these third-party infringement claims, regardless of their merit. Successful infringement or other intellectual property rights claims against us may result in substantial monetary liabilities, which may disrupt our operations and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. Some of our employees were previously employed at other companies, including our current and potential competitors. We also intend to hire additional personnel to expand our development team and technical support team. To the extent these employees are involved in the development of content or technology similar to ours at their former employers, we may become subject to claims that such employees or we may have appropriated proprietary information or intellectual properties of the former employers of our employees. If we fail to successfully defend such claims against us, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We could be liable for our users' privacy being compromised, which may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business. Although we seek to provide a safe playing environment for our users by implementing a sophisticated security mechanism, our virtual worlds are subject to infiltrating behaviors from child predators and others who hack the accounts of our users to gain progression advantages, access these users' accounts, or for other purposes. Despite our efforts to employ security features to filter offensive content and monitor users' interactions, there is no guarantee that we can successfully keep our users free from predatory behavior, offensive contact or other acts that violate the privacy of our users. A significant number of failures to prevent our users' exposure to such infiltration would severely harm our reputation and business. We could be liable for breaches of security of our website and third-party payment systems, which may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, 19.7%, 26.1% and 28.1%, respectively, of our net sales proceeds collected were generated from sales of our virtual currency through third-party payment systems. In such transactions, secure transmission of confidential information, such as users' debit and credit card numbers and expiration dates, personal information and billing addresses, over public networks, including our official website, is essential for maintaining user confidence. We currently provide password protection for all of our users' accounts. In addition, we are developing new tools to better ensure the security of our users' accounts in the future. While we have not experienced any material breach of our security to date, we still must prevent future breaches and current security measures may be inadequate. In addition, we expect that an increasing number of our sales will be conducted over the Internet as a result of the expanded user base and the growing use of online payment systems. We also expect that associated online crime will likely increase accordingly. We must therefore be prepared to increase our security measures and efforts so that our users have confidence in the reliability of the online payment systems that we use. We do not have control over the security measures of our third- 14 Table of Contents party payment operators, and their security measures may not be adequate at present or may not be adequate with the expected increased usage of online payment systems. We could be exposed to litigation and possible liability if we fail to safeguard confidential user information, which could harm our reputation and our ability to attract users and may have a material adverse effect on our business. The successful operation of our online business depends on the performance and reliability of the Internet infrastructure and fixed telecommunications networks in China. Our online business depends on the performance and reliability of the Internet infrastructure in China. Almost all access to the Internet is maintained through state-owned telecommunication operators under the administrative control and regulatory supervision of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT. In addition, the national networks in China are connected to the Internet through international gateways controlled by the PRC government. These international gateways are the only channels through which a domestic user can connect to the Internet. Although the PRC government has pledged to improve the Internet infrastructure in China as part of its stimulus packaged introduced in the first quarter of 2009, a more sophisticated Internet infrastructure may not be developed in China. We or the users of our virtual worlds may not have access to alternative networks in the event of disruptions, failures or other problems with China's Internet infrastructure. Unexpected network interruptions, network security breaches or computer virus attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to maintain the satisfactory performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure may cause significant harm to our reputation and our ability to attract and maintain users. All of the servers operating our virtual worlds, all of the servers handling log-in, billing and data back-up matters for us, and all of our backup servers are hosted by third-party service providers, and are maintained by our internal personnel. Major risks involved in such network infrastructure include any break-downs or system failures resulting in a sustained shutdown of all or a material portion of our servers, including failures that may be attributable to sustained power shutdowns, or efforts to gain unauthorized access to our systems causing loss or corruption of data or malfunctions of software or hardware. In the past, our server network has experienced unexpected outages for several hours and occasional slower performance in a number of locations in China as a result of failures by third-party service providers. Our network systems are also vulnerable to damage from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hacking and similar events. Any network interruption, virus or other inadequacy that causes interruptions in the availability of our virtual worlds or deterioration in the quality of access to our virtual worlds could reduce our users' satisfaction and ultimately harm our business and results of operations. We face risks associated with the licensing of our virtual worlds overseas, and if we are unable to effectively manage these risks, they could impair our ability to expand our business internationally. In order to expand into overseas markets, we have licensed our virtual worlds, including Mole's World, Seer, Seer II, Flower Fairy, Gong Fu Pai and Reverse World to overseas operators. As of the date of this annual report, our virtual worlds are licensed in countries and regions including Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. We may license our existing and new products in other countries and regions in the future. The offering of our products in the international markets could expose us to a number of risks, including: difficulties in identifying and maintaining good relationships with licensees who are knowledgeable about, and can effectively distribute and operate our products in, international markets; 15 Table of Contents difficulties in maintaining the reputation of our company and our products, given that our virtual worlds are operated by licensees in the international markets pursuant to their own standards; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights internationally and the associated costs; difficulties and costs relating to compliance with the different commercial, legal and tax requirements of the international markets in which we offer our products, such as foreign ownership restrictions, game import regulatory procedures, taxes and other restrictions; difficulties and uncertainties in obtaining software export contract registration license from the relevant PRC authorities; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and interruptions in cross-border Internet connections or other system failures. If we are unable to effectively manage such risks, they could impair our ability to expand our business internationally. We have ceased our cooperation with some of the third-party operators because the operation results did not meet our expectation. Our business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our management and other key personnel. If we lose their services, we could incur significant costs in finding suitable replacements and our business may be severely disrupted. Our future success heavily depends upon the continued services of our management and other key personnel. In particular, we rely on the expertise and experience of Mr. Benson Haibing Wang, our chief executive officer, and Mr. Roc Yunpeng Cheng, our president. In 2013 and 2014, certain of our executive officers resigned from their positions. For example, Mr. Crow Zhen Wei stepped down from his position as our chief technology officer for personal reasons, although he remained as a member of our board of directors and also served as an honorary outside counsel. At present time, we do not plan to find a replacement of chief technology officer. In addition, Mr. Paul Keung, our chief financial officer, will be gradually handing over his responsibility in the near term to a new incoming chief financial officer. Mr. Paul Keung will remain his position as our chief financial officer during the transition period including the filing of this annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2013. Although we believe that these changes of our management team did not materially affect our business operations, if one or more of our senior management or key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions in the future, we may not be able to replace them easily or at all, and our business may be severely disrupted, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we may incur additional expenses to recruit, train and retain key personnel. If any of our management or key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose users, distributors, know-how and key professionals and staff members. Each of our executive officers has entered into employment agreements and confidentiality agreements and the majority of them have entered into non-competition agreements with us. However, if any dispute arises between our officers and us, the non-competition provisions contained in their non-competition agreements may not be enforceable, especially in China, where most of these executive officers and key employees reside, on the ground that we have not provided adequate compensation to these executive officers for their non-competition obligations, which is required under the relevant PRC regulations. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. We will need to hire and retain additional qualified employees to support our existing operations and planned expansion. Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing user needs 16 Table of Contents depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel for our online and offline businesses in technology, graphic design, operation and other functions. The effective operation of our information technology system, call center, logistics and other back office functions also depends in part on our professional employees. Since our industry is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent, we may need to offer higher compensation and other benefits in order to retain key personnel in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain the qualified key personnel that we will need to achieve our business objectives. In addition, as our business has grown rapidly, our ability to train and integrate new employees into our operations may not meet the increasing demands of our business. Our principal shareholders have substantial influence over our company and their interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other holders of our ordinary shares and ADSs. As of December 31, 2013, our founders, Mr. Jason Liqing Zeng, Mr. Benson Haibing Wang, Mr. Crow Zhen Wei and Mr. Roc Yunpeng Cheng, who beneficially own our shares through a number of holding entities, and the Qiming Funds together hold 69.3% of our outstanding share capital. Accordingly, our founders and the Qiming Funds have substantial influence over our business, including decisions regarding mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, election and change of directors and other significant corporate actions. This concentration of ownership may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might reduce the price of our ADSs. Alternatively, these principal shareholders may cause a merger, consolidation or change of control transaction even if it is opposed by our other shareholders. Our operating results fluctuate from period to period, making them difficult to predict and may not be indicative of future performance. Our operating results from period to period are highly dependent upon, and will fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including: seasonal trends in revenue generation as a result of seasonal fluctuations of active users and online play time, which peaks during summer and winter school vacation periods, which usually occur in the first and third quarters of each year when children have more online playtime, and falls during second and fourth quarters of each year, and generally increases during the Chinese New Year holidays, which occurs in the first quarter of each year, when children are given extra pocket money; the introduction of virtual worlds and other online and offline services and products; the quality, variety, popularity and mix of virtual items and online and offline services and products available for purchase and related promotional efforts; the period of time over which we recognize revenue for some of our virtual items in our virtual worlds, which in certain cases is based on the estimated lifespan of our virtual items, which may be adjusted from time to time; the period of time which we launch our films and recognize the films related revenue; content development costs and licensing or royalty payments; and the expansion of our distribution network and the related discounts and rebates. Additionally, because most of our operating expenses are expected to remain stable in absolute amount in the future, our net income during any given quarter may be adversely affected by any decrease in revenue due to the seasonality effect. 17 Table of Contents Due to these and other factors, our operating results will vary from period to period, will be difficult to predict for any given period, may be adversely affected from period to period and may not be indicative of our future performance. If we fail to establish or maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our shares may, therefore, be adversely impacted. As a U.S. public company, we are subject to reporting obligations under the U.S. securities laws. Our reporting obligations as a public company will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future. We are required to prepare a management report on our internal controls over financial reporting containing our management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, depending on our market capitalization, our independent registered public accounting firm may be required to attest to and report on our management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Our management may conclude that our internal controls over our financial reporting are not effective. Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may still decline to attest to our management's assessment or may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. Prior to our initial public offering, we had been a private company with a short operating history and limited numbers of accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal controls and procedures. In connection with the audit of our consolidated and combined financial statements for 2011, 2012 and 2013, we and our auditors, an independent registered public accounting firm, identified certain significant deficiencies and deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in the standards established by the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB. In connection with our management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, we have not noted any material weakness, as defined in the standards established by the PCAOB, in our internal controls over financial reporting. We will continue to implement measures to remedy any deficiencies to meet the deadline imposed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we fail to timely achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future. Moreover, effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the market price of our ordinary shares. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will incur considerable costs and use significant management time and other resources in an effort to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The audit report included in this annual report are prepared by auditors who are not inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and, as such, you are deprived of the benefits of such inspection Our independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit reports included in our annual reports filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, as auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or the PCAOB, is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess its compliance with the laws of the United States and professional standards. Because our auditors are located in the Peoples' Republic of China, a 18 Table of Contents jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities, our auditors are not currently inspected by the PCAOB. Inspections of other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside China have identified deficiencies in those firms' audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. This lack of PCAOB inspections in China prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditor's audits and its quality control procedures. As a result, investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor's audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections. Investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements. We may be unable to secure additional funding in the future or to obtain such funding on favorable terms. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and the anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next 12 months. We may, however, require additional cash resources to finance our continued growth or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. The amount and timing of such additional financing needs will vary principally depending on the timing of new product launches, investments and/or acquisitions, and the amount of cash flow from our operations. If our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to issue additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into our ordinary shares could result in additional dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. Our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all, especially if there is a recession or other events causing volatilities in the capital markets worldwide. We have limited insurance coverage which could expose us to significant costs and business disruption. Other than insurance for some of the vehicles used in our business, we have not purchased any insurance to cover our assets, property and business. If we were to incur substantial losses or liabilities due to fire, explosions, floods, a wide range of other natural disasters or accidents or business interruption, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure If the PRC government determines that the contractual arrangements that establish the structure for operating our business do not comply with applicable PRC laws and regulations, we could be subject to severe penalties. We are a Cayman Islands company and, as such, we are classified as a foreign enterprise under Chinese laws, and our PRC subsidiary, Shanghai Shengran Information Technology Co., Ltd., or Shanghai Shengran, is a foreign-invested enterprise. Various regulations in China currently restrict or prevent foreign-invested entities from holding certain licenses required to operate online virtual worlds, including Internet content provision, Internet culture operation and Internet publishing licenses. In light of these restrictions, we rely on our VIE, Shanghai Taomee, to hold and maintain the licenses necessary to operate our virtual worlds in China. We do not have any equity interest in Shanghai Taomee but receive its economic benefits through various contractual arrangements and certain corporate governance and shareholder rights arrangements. In addition, we have entered into agreements with Shanghai Taomee and its shareholders which provide us with a substantial ability to control Shanghai Taomee. For a description of these contractual arrangements with Shanghai Taomee, 19 Table of Contents see "Item 4. Information on the CompanyC. Organizational StructureContractual Arrangements with Shanghai Taomee and its Shareholders." The Circular on Strengthening the Administration of Foreign Investment in and Operation of Value-added Telecommunications Business, or the MII Circular, issued by the MII, in July 2006, reiterated the regulations on foreign investment in telecommunications businesses, which require foreign investors to set up foreign-invested enterprises and obtain a business operating license for Internet content provision to conduct any value-added telecommunications business in China. Under the MII Circular, a domestic company that holds an Internet content provision license is prohibited from leasing, transferring or selling the license to foreign investors in any form, and from providing any assistance, including providing resources, sites or facilities, to foreign investors that conduct value-added telecommunications business illegally in China. Furthermore, the relevant trademarks and domain names that are used in the value-added telecommunications business must be owned by the local Internet content provision license holder. The MII Circular further requires each Internet content provision license holder to have the necessary facilities for its approved business operations and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license. In addition, all value-added telecommunications service providers are required to maintain network and information security in accordance with the standards set forth under relevant PRC regulations. Due to a lack of interpretative materials from the regulator, it is unclear what impact the MII Circular will have on us or the other Chinese Internet companies that have adopted the same or similar corporate and contractual structures as ours. In the opinion of Allbright Law Offices, our PRC counsel, (i) the ownership structure and the business and operation model of Shanghai Shengran and Shanghai Taomee are not in violation of any provisions of applicable PRC laws and regulations, and (ii) each contract under Shanghai Shengran's contractual arrangements with Shanghai Taomee and its shareholders is valid and legally binding. However, there are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations, including the MII Circular. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the PRC regulatory authorities will ultimately take a view that is consistent with the opinion of our PRC counsel. If we are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, including the MII Circular, or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals, the relevant regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violation, including levying fines, confiscating our income, revoking Shanghai Shengran or Shanghai Taomee's business or operating licenses, requiring us to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations, and requiring us to discontinue or restrict our transaction with our VIEs, VIEs' subsidiaries or PRC subsidiaries, limit our business expansion in China by contractual arrangements, or restrict or prohibit our use of proceeds to finance our business and operation China. If any of these actions results in our inability to direct the activities of VIEs or VIEs' subsidiaries that affect their economic performance, and/or our failure to receive the economic benefits from VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries, we may not be able to consolidate the operating results of our VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries into our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, we do not believe that such actions would result in the liquidation or dissolution of our company or our wholly owned subsidiaries. If the PRC government determines that our ownership structure does not comply with the restrictions contained in the GAPP Notice, we could be subject to severe penalties. Our virtual worlds are deemed online games by relevant PRC government authorities and we are subject to relevant PRC regulations on operators of online games. On September 28, 2009, the General Administration of Press and Publication, or the GAPP, together with the National Copyright Administration, and National Office of Combating Pornography and Illegal Publications jointly issued a Notice on Further Strengthening of the Administration of Pre-examination and Approval of Online Game and the Examination and Approval of Imported Online Game, or the GAPP Notice. The GAPP 20 Table of Contents Notice provides, among other things, that foreign investors are not permitted to invest in online game operating businesses in China via wholly-owned, equity joint venture or cooperative joint venture investments, and expressly prohibits foreign investors from gaining control over or participating in domestic online game operators through indirect ways such as establishing other joint venture companies, or contractual or technical arrangements. We are not aware of any online game companies adopting the same or similar contractual arrangements as ours having been penalized or ordered to be terminated since the GAPP Notice first became effective. As advised by our PRC counsel, Allbright Law Offices, there is uncertainty with respect to the implementation of the GAPP Notice; however, the GAPP is unlikely to directly affect our control over our PRC subsidiary, VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries without joint actions with other authorities including the Ministry of Culture, based on the GAPP Notice, since (i) according to the relevant provisions of the Regulation on the Main Functions, Internal Organization and Staffing of the GAPP issued by the General Office of the State Council on July 11, 2008, or the Regulation on Three Provisions, the GAPP is authorized to approve the publication of online games before their launch on the Internet, while the Ministry of Culture is authorized to administer and regulate the overall online game industry; (ii) a circular on the interpretation of the Regulations on Three Provisions, which was issued by the office of the Central Organization Establishment Commission on September 7, 2009, provides that once an online game is launched on the Internet, it will only be regulated by the Ministry of Culture, and that if an online game is launched on the Internet without prior approval of the GAPP, the Ministry of Culture, instead of the GAPP, is the direct authority to investigate the game; and (iii) the original set of our contractual agreements with our significant VIE took effect in June 2009, which was prior to the effective date of the GAPP Notice. There are, however, uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of the GAPP Notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the GAPP will not ultimately take a view that is contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel. In the event that we, our PRC subsidiary or VIEs are found to be in violation of the GAPP Notice to operate our online virtual worlds, the GAPP in conjunction with the relevant regulatory authorities would have the power to investigate and deal with such violations, including in the most serious cases where relevant licenses and registrations would be suspended or revoked. Our contractual arrangements with Shanghai Taomee and its shareholders may not be as effective in providing control over Shanghai Taomee as direct ownership of this company. We conduct our business in China through Shanghai Taomee. Our contractual arrangements with Shanghai Taomee and its shareholders provide us with effective control over Shanghai Taomee. See "Item 4. Information on the CompanyOrganizational StructureContractual Arrangements with Shanghai Taomee and its Shareholders." As a result of these contractual arrangements, we are considered to be the primary beneficiary of Shanghai Taomee and accordingly, we consolidate the results of operations, assets and liabilities of Shanghai Taomee in our financial statements. Although we have been advised by Allbright Law Offices, our PRC legal counsel, that each contract under these contractual arrangements is valid and legally binding, these contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing us with control over Shanghai Taomee as direct ownership of this company. If Shanghai Taomee or its shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under these contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and resources to enforce such arrangements, and rely on legal remedies under PRC law, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages, which we cannot assure you that it will be effective. See "Risks Related to Our Corporate StructureOur ability to enforce the Equity Interest Pledge Agreements between us and the shareholders of Shanghai Taomee may be subject to limitations based on PRC laws and regulations". These contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the PRC. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in 21 Table of Contents accordance with PRC law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal environment in the PRC is not as developed as in other jurisdictions, such as the United States. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements, which may make it difficult to exert effective control over our VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries, and our ability to conduct our business may be negatively affected and we may not be able to consolidate the financial results of our VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries into our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See "Risks Related to Doing Business in ChinaUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could have a material adverse effect on us." The shareholders of Shanghai Taomee may have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. Shanghai Taomee is jointly owned by Mr. Jason Liqing Zeng, our chairman, Mr. Benson Haibing Wang, our co-founder, director and chief executive officer, Mr. Crow Zhen Wei, our co-founder and director, Mr. Roc Yunpeng Cheng, our co-founder, director and president, Mr. Bin Wang and Mr. Yuliang Feng. In addition, except for Mr. Bin Wang and Mr. Yuliang Feng, the above other individuals are also directors or executive officers of Shanghai Taomee. The PRC Company Law provides that a director or member of management owes a fiduciary duty to the company he directs or manages. The abovementioned individuals, except for Mr. Bin Wang and Mr. Yuliang Feng, must therefore act in good faith and in the best interests of Shanghai Taomee and must not use their respective positions for personal gain. These laws do not require them to consider our best interests when making decisions as a director or member of management of Shanghai Taomee. Conflicts of interests between these individuals' role as shareholders or directors of Shanghai Taomee and their duties to our company may arise. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise, these individuals will act in the best interests of our company or that conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor. In addition, these individuals may breach or cause Shanghai Taomee to breach or refuse to renew the existing contractual arrangements that allow us to effectively control Shanghai Taomee, and receive economic benefits from it. Currently, we do not have arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest between these individuals and our company and a conflict could result in these individuals as officers of our company violating fiduciary duties to us. We believe these individuals will not act contrary to any of the contractual arrangements, and the option agreements entered into by each of these individuals with our company entitled us to remove the shareholders as beneficial shareholders of the VIEs should any of them act in a way that is detrimental to our company. We rely on these individuals as our directors and executive officers to fulfill their fiduciary duties and abide by laws of the PRC and Cayman Islands and act in the best interest of our company. However, if we cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or disputes between us and any of the shareholders of Shanghai Taomee, we would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in disruption to our business, and there would be uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings. Our ability to enforce the Equity Interest Pledge Agreements between us and the shareholders of Shanghai Taomee may be subject to limitations based on PRC laws and regulations. Pursuant to the Equity Interest Pledge Agreements with the shareholders of Shanghai Taomee, such shareholders agreed to pledge their equity interests in Shanghai Taomee to secure their performance under the relevant contractual arrangements. The equity pledges of Shanghai Taomee under these Equity Interest Pledge Agreements have been registered with the local branch of State Administration for Industry and Commerce pursuant to the new PRC Property Rights Law. According to the PRC Property Rights Law and PRC Guarantee Law, the pledgee and the pledgor are prohibited from making an agreement prior to the expiration of the debt performance period to transfer the ownership of the pledged equity to the pledgee when the obligor fails to pay the debt due. However, 22 Table of Contents under the PRC Property Rights Law, when an obligor fails to pay its debt when due, the pledgee may choose to either conclude an agreement with the pledgor to obtain the pledged equity or seek payments from the proceeds of the auction or sell-off of the pledged equity. If Shanghai Taomee or its respective shareholders fail to perform their obligations secured by the pledges under the equity pledge agreements, one remedy in the event of default under the agreements is to require the pledgor to sell the equity interests of Shanghai Taomee in an auction or private sale and remit the proceeds to our wholly owned subsidiary in China, net of related taxes and expenses. Such an auction or private sale may not result in our receipt of the full value of the equity interests in Shanghai Taomee. We consider it very unlikely that the public auction process would be undertaken since, in an event of default, our preferred approach is to ask Shanghai Shengran, our PRC wholly owned subsidiary and a party to the Option Agreements, to replace or designate another PRC person or entity to replace the existing shareholders of Shanghai Taomee pursuant to the direct transfer option we have under the Option Agreement. In addition, in the registration forms of the local branch of State Administration for Industry and Commerce for the pledges over the equity interests under the Equity Interest Pledge Agreements, the amount of registered equity interests in Shanghai Taomee pledged to us was stated as RMB10,000,000, which represents 100% of the registered capital of Shanghai Taomee. The Equity Interest Pledge Agreements with the shareholders of Shanghai Taomee provide that the pledged equity interest shall constitute continuing security for any and all of the indebtedness, obligations and liabilities under all of the contractual arrangements. In case of a breach of the contractual arrangement, Shanghai Shengran, as the pledgee, can require the shareholders of Shanghai Taomee to sell the pledged equity interest in a private sale or auction in order to realize Shanghai Shengran's right to the pledged equity interest in Shanghai Taomee. However, if the proceeds obtained by the shareholders of Shanghai Taomee from the foregoing realization process are insufficient to cover the full amount payable to Shanghai Shengran, the uncovered part will be determined as unsecured debt and will rank pari passu with other unsecured debt of the shareholders of Shanghai Taomee. We do not have agreements that pledge the assets of Shanghai Taomee for the benefit of us. Contractual arrangements we have entered into may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities, and a finding that we or our affiliated entities owe additional taxes could reduce our net income and the value of your investment. As required by applicable PRC laws and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties need to be periodically filed with local tax authorities and may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC tax authorities. We could face adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that the contractual arrangements between Shanghai Shengran and Shanghai Taomee do not represent pricing at arm's length and adjust Shanghai Taomee's income in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. A transfer pricing adjustment could, among other things, result in a reduction, for PRC tax purposes, of expense deductions recorded by Shanghai Taomee, which could in turn increase its tax liabilities. In addition, the PRC tax authorities may impose late payment fees and other penalties on our affiliated entities for underpaid taxes. Our net income may be adversely affected if our affiliated entities' tax liabilities increase or if they are found to be subject to late payment fees or other penalties. 23 Table of Contents Risks Related to Doing Business in China Changes in economic and political policies of the PRC government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could adversely affect our business. Substantially all of our business operations are conducted in China. Accordingly, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects are subject to a significant degree to economic, political and legal developments in China. While China's economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy, and may slow down in the future. Any prolonged slowdown in the Chinese economy, in particular the information technology industry, could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition in a number of ways. For example, our users may decrease spending on our products, while we may have difficulty expanding our user base fast enough, or at all, to offset the impact of decreased spending by our existing users. Although the Chinese economy is no longer a planned economy, the PRC government continues to exercise significant control over China's economic growth through direct allocation of resources, monetary and tax policies, and a host of other government policies such as those that encourage or restrict investment in certain industries by foreign investors, control the exchange between RMB and foreign currencies, and regulate the growth of the general or specific market. These government involvements have been instrumental in China's significant growth in the past 30 years. If the PRC government's current or future policies fail to help the Chinese economy achieve further growth or otherwise negatively affect our business, our growth rate or strategy, our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result. Uncertainties in PRC government policies and regulations regarding virtual worlds and online games and children's Internet use in China may adversely affect our business. In April 2007, the GAPP, the MII, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Public Security, and other relevant government authorities jointly issued a circular concerning the mandatory implementation of an addiction prevention program in virtual worlds and online games, which aims to protect the physical and psychological health of minors. This circular requires all virtual worlds to incorporate an addiction prevention program and an identity verification system, both of which limit the amount of time that a minor or other user may continuously spend participating in a virtual world or playing an online game. Failure to do so may subject us to certain penalties, such as suspension of Internet publishing operation and relevant Internet-access services or revocation of relevant licenses. On June 3, 2010, the Ministry of Culture, or the MOC, adopted the Provisional Administration Measures of Online Games, or the Online Games Administration Measures, which became effective as of August 1, 2010. The MOC also issued a notice regarding the implementation of the Online Games Administration Measures. We are required to establish the identity verification systems within three months of the effectiveness of the Online Games Administration Measures for online games and virtual worlds which started operation after August 1, 2010, and within six months for those which started operation prior to August 1, 2010. Failing to do so may subject us to an order from relevant authorities to rectify and a fine up to RMB20,000 (approximately US$3,304). However, since the users of our virtual worlds are principally minors, the implementation of an identity verification system has practical difficulties, mainly because most minors do not have PRC identity cards. We understand that the purpose of identity verification system required under the abovementioned circular issued in 2007 is to facilitate addiction prevention; hence, we have implemented addiction prevention programs for all users of our virtual worlds. We have established the identity verification system in all of our virtual worlds and are currently using it as one of the ways for registration. We plan to use the identity verification system as the only option for registration once required by relevant authorities. 24 Table of Contents In addition, a notice jointly issued by several central governmental agencies in February 2007 increased the punishment for Internet cafés admitting minors. As Internet cafés provide means for children to access the Internet especially in smaller cities, this restriction may adversely affect our plan for growth in these cities. Further strengthening of these regulations, or enactment by the PRC government of any additional laws to further tighten its administration over the Internet, online games, and, in particular, the Internet use and access to online games and virtual worlds by children, may result in less time spent by users or fewer users, which may materially and adversely affect our business results and prospects for future growth. The laws and regulations governing virtual worlds and online games in China are developing and are subject to future changes. If we or the third-party publishers we work with fail to obtain or maintain all applicable permits and approvals, our business and operations would be materially and adversely affected. The online game industry in China is heavily regulated by the PRC government. Various regulatory authorities of the PRC central government, such as the State Council, the MIIT, the GAPP, the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Public Security, have the authority to issue and implement regulations governing various aspects of the online game industries. We are required to obtain applicable permits or approvals from different regulatory authorities in order to operate our virtual worlds. An Internet content provider, or ICP, such as Shanghai Taomee, must obtain an ICP license in order to engage in any commercial ICP operations in China. Online game operators must also obtain a license from the Ministry of Culture and an Internet publishing license from the GAPP in order to distribute games through the Internet. We hold the Internet culture operation license issued by the Ministry of Culture and the Internet publishing license issued by GAPP. Prior to obtaining the Internet publishing license from GAPP, we worked with third party publishers to publish Mole's World, Seer, Flower Fairy, Magic Haqi and Gong Fu Pai. We have obtained 19 approvals from the GAPP in total, covering the Internet publications of all the virtual worlds which are developed by us and have been commercially launched, including the above-mentioned five franchises of Mole's World, Seer, Magic Haqi, Flower Fairy and Gong Fu Pai. If we cannot obtain the GAPP approval for our virtual worlds to be launched in future or fail to maintain any of our permits or approvals, we may be subject to various penalties, including fines and the discontinuation or restriction of our operations. Any such disruption in our business operations would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As virtual worlds and online game industry is at an early stage of development in China, new laws and regulations may be adopted from time to time to require additional licenses and permits other than those we currently have. As a result, uncertainties exist regarding the interpretation and implementation of current and future PRC laws and regulations applicable to virtual worlds. We cannot assure you that we will be able to timely obtain required licenses or any other new license required in the future, or at all. We cannot assure you that we will not be found in violation of any current or future PRC laws and regulations. The laws and regulations governing virtual worlds and online games in China are developing and are subject to future changes. If we, as the developer of our mobile games, are required to obtain applicable permits and licenses before their release online, or if we are required to obtain approval for the release of our e-books on mobile platforms, it may materially and adversely affect our business results and future growth. According to the Regulation on Three Provisions, the term of online games refers to all the online game works provided to the public through the Internet (including wired Internet and wireless network) for online user interaction or download, which includes but is not limited to MMORPG, web games, casual games, PC game downloading, games with net connection function, online counter strike game platforms and online mobile games. In addition, the distribution of online games to the public 25 Table of Contents through the Internet for online user interaction or download is deemed as publication of such online games and is subject to the approval of the GAPP before such online games are distributed online. To further build our franchises and animated characters, we expanded into mobile platforms and have developed diversified mobile games and applications. Since the release of our first mobile game, Mole's World iOS version in October 2011, we have further expanded our mobile game portfolio, including multiple games based on Seer franchise and Mole's World franchise. All of our mobile games can be downloaded onto iPhones and iPads through Apple's App Store, and some games can also be downloaded onto Android based mobile devices. We may charge a fee for download or provide free download of our mobile products, depending on the nature of our different types of products and relevant distribution strategies; while we may have an in-application purchase system for virtual items. Currently, there is no official or public interpretation on the distinction between the terms of online games and mobile games, and we understand that the term of online mobile games are covered by the definition of "online games" under the Regulation on Three Provisions, and we have obtained the approvals from the GAPP covering all of our online games, including Mole's World and Seer. However, it still remains uncertain whether we need to obtain approvals for our online mobile games before we distribute such mobile games online. Furthermore, even under the assumption that our mobile games are subject to separate approvals before they are released online, it is still unclear whether we, as the developer of our games, or the third-party operators who manage and operate the platform where our mobile games are offered to the public for download, are required to apply for the approval from GAPP before such online mobile games are distributed online. As of December 31, 2013, we have released over ten e-books which featured the Mole's World franchise and Seer animation application on Apple's iOS platform. According to the Opinions of GAPP on the Development of E-Books Industry, which was promulgated by GAPP on October 9, 2010 and took effective on the same day, enterprises engaging in e-book industries are subject to approvals and administration from relevant governmental authorities. In addition, enterprises engaging in the creation, editing and publication of e-books or in the operation of platform where the e-book resources are delivered to users are deemed as e-book publishers and are subject to approvals for the publication of e-books. Since there is no official or public interpretation on the definition of e-book publication, we are not certain whether our release of e-books on mobile platforms will be deemed as publication and therefore be subject to the approval of GAPP. If relevant governmental authorities retroactively determine that we should obtain separate approvals for our online mobile games before we distribute them online, or that we should apply for approval for the release of our e-books on mobile platforms, we may be subject to penalties or an order to withdraw our mobile games and/or e-books from the Internet, which may adversely affect our business results and prospects for future growth. The laws and regulations governing animation televisions and films in China are developing and are subject to future changes. If we or the third-parties we work with fail to obtain or maintain all applicable permits and approvals, our business and operations would be materially and adversely affected. The film and animation industry of PRC is regulated mainly by the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, or SARFT. The administration of the foregoing industry is mainly focused on the production and broadcasting of a film and animation television series. According to the Regulations on the Administration of Movies promulgated by the State Council of PRC on December 25, 2001 which took effective as of February 1, 2002, the film production entity is required to either obtain a Film Production License for engaging in film production activities or a One-Time Film Production License for each single film to be produced. In addition, upon the completion of the film making, the film production entity is required to submit the film to the local 26 Table of Contents branch of SARFT for examination. SARFT will issue a License of Public Screening for each film that passes such examination, allowing the broadcast of such film to the public. On July 19, 2004, SARFT promulgated the Administration Rules on the Production and Operation of Broadcasting Television Programs, pursuant to which an entity that plans to produce and operate television and broadcast programs in China is required to obtain the License for Producing and Operating Television and Broadcast Programs. On July 11, 2006, SARFT issued Provisional Regulations on Filing and Publicity of Domestic Television Animations, stipulating that registrations for domestic television animations must be filed with, and be publicly displayed by, SARFT prior to their production. On February 14, 2008, SARFT promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television on Strengthening the Administration of the Broadcasting of Domestic Animation Series and on May 14, 2010, SARFT further promulgated Regulations on Content of Television Series, which stated that for each domestic television animation completed, the animation production entity is required to obtain the Domestic Animation Publication License prior to the broadcast of such domestic television animation to the public. We cooperate with third parties with the requisite qualifications and licenses in the production and distribution of the animation series and film based on our Mole's World franchise and the film based on our Seer franchise. Shanghai Taomee Animation Co., Ltd. has obtained (i) the license for the production and broadcasting of radio and television program, and the license for the broadcasting of Seer I, Seer II, Mole's World III and Flower Fairy animation series, (ii) one-time film production license and distribution license for the third film based on our Seer franchise, and (iii) one-time film production license for the third film based on our Mole's World franchise. If we fail to renew the Broadcasting and Television Program Production License obtained by us or if we or the third parties we worked with cannot obtain the license from SARFT for any of our future animation television series or films, the business of animation and film production will be adversely affected. Any such disruption in our business operations would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The laws and regulations governing broadcasting audio/video programs through the Internet in China are developing and are subject to future changes. If we or the third-parties we work with fail to obtain or maintain all applicable permits and approvals, our business and operations would be materially and adversely affected. On July 6, 2004, the SARFT promulgated the Rules for the Administration of Broadcasting of Audio/Video Programs through the Internet and Other Information Networks, or the Audio/Video Broadcasting Rules. The Audio/Video Broadcasting Rules apply to the opening, broadcasting, integration, transmission or download of audio/video programs via the Internet and other information networks. Anyone who wishes to engage in Internet broadcasting activities must first obtain an audio/video program transmission license, with a term of two years, issued by the SARFT and operate pursuant to the scope as provided in such license. Foreign-invested enterprises are not allowed to engage in the above business. On December 20, 2007, the SARFT and the MIIT jointly issued the Rules for the Administration of Internet Audio and Video Program Services, commonly known as Document 56, which came into effect as of January 31, 2008. Document 56 reiterates the requirement set forth in the Audio/Video Broadcasting Rules that online audio/video service provider must obtain a license from the SARFT. Furthermore, Document 56 requires all online audio/video service providers to be either wholly state-owned or state-controlled. According to relevant official answers to press questions published on the SARFT's website dated February 3, 2008, officials from the SARFT and the MIIT clarified that online audio/video service providers that already had been operating lawfully prior to the issuance of Document 56 may re-register and continue to operate without becoming state-owned or controlled, 27 Table of Contents provided that such providers have not engaged in any unlawful activities. This exemption will not be granted to online audio/video service providers established after Document 56 was issued. In January 2012, in cooperation with a number of China's leading online video websites who have obtained the audio/video program transmission licenses, we launched v.61.com, a website that offers animation series based on our franchises, such as Seer and Mole's World, as well as other content from these websites. In November 2012, we jointly developed with Turner Broadcasting System Asia Pacific (the parent company of Cartoon Network) ben10.61.com, a dedicated Chinese online zone for Ben 10 fans featuring videos, online games, wallpaper downloads, e-comics and character profiles. If the governmental authorities determine that our website v.61.com and ben10.61.com falls within Document 56, we may not be able to obtain the audio/video program transmission license as required, and we may become subject to penalties, fines or an order to suspend our website v.61.com and ben10.61.com. Regulation and censorship of information disseminated over the Internet in China may adversely affect our business, and we may be liable for information displayed on, retrieved from, or linked to our Internet websites. The PRC government has adopted certain regulations governing Internet access and the distribution of news and other information over the Internet. Under these regulations, Internet content providers and Internet publishers are prohibited from posting or displaying over the Internet content that, among other things, violates PRC laws and regulations, impairs the national dignity of China, or is obscene, superstitious, fraudulent or defamatory. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the revocation of ICP and other required licenses and the closure of the concerned websites. The website operator may also be held liable for such prohibited information displayed on, retrieved from or linked to such website. In addition, the MIIT has published regulations that subject website operators to potential liability for content included on their websites and the actions of users and others using their websites, including liability for violations of PRC laws prohibiting the dissemination of content deemed to be socially destabilizing. The Ministry of Public Security has the authority to order any local Internet service provider, or ISP, to block any Internet website maintained outside China at its sole discretion. Periodically, the Ministry of Public Security has stopped the dissemination over the Internet of information which it believes to be socially destabilizing. The State Secrecy Bureau, which is directly responsible for the protection of State secrets of the PRC government, is authorized to block any website it deems to be leaking state secrets or failing to meet the relevant regulations relating to the protection of state secrets in the dissemination of online information. As these regulations are subject to interpretation by the relevant authorities, it may not be possible for us to determine in all cases the type of content that could result in liability for us as a website operator. In addition, we may not be able to control or restrict the content of other Internet content providers linked to or accessible through our websites, or content generated or placed on our websites by our users, despite our attempt to monitor such content. To the extent that regulatory authorities find any portion of our content objectionable, they may require us to limit or eliminate the dissemination of such information or otherwise curtail the nature of such content on our websites, which may reduce our user traffic and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be subject to significant penalties for violations of those regulations arising from information displayed on, retrieved from or linked to our websites, including a suspension or shutdown of our operations. There are currently no laws or regulations in the PRC governing property rights of virtual assets and therefore it is not clear what liabilities, if any, we may have relating to the loss of virtual assets by our users. Users of our virtual worlds acquire and accumulate some virtual assets, such as performance-enhancing items, clothing, accessories and other in-game items. Such virtual assets can be highly valued 28 Table of Contents by users. In practice, virtual assets can be lost for various reasons, such as data loss caused by delay of network service by a network crash, or by hacking activities. There are currently no PRC laws and regulations governing property rights of virtual assets. As a result, it is unclear who the legal owner of virtual assets is and whether the ownership of virtual assets is protected by law. In addition, it is unclear under PRC law whether an operator of virtual worlds such as us would have any liability (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) for loss of such virtual assets by users. Based on several judgments regarding the liabilities of online game operators for loss of virtual assets by users, the courts have generally required the online game operators to provide well-developed security systems to protect such virtual assets owned by users. In the event of a loss of virtual assets, we may be sued by users and may be held liable for damages. Restrictions on virtual currency may adversely affect our game operations revenues. Our virtual world operations revenues are collected through the sale of our prepaid cards. The Notice on the Reinforcement of the Administration of Online Games issued by the Ministry of Culture and other governmental authorities on February 15, 2007, directs the People's Bank of China to strengthen the administration of virtual currency in online games to avoid any adverse impact on the PRC economy and financial system. This notice also applies to virtual worlds we operate. This notice provides that the total amount of virtual currency issued by online game operators and the amount purchased by individual users should be strictly limited, with a strict and clear division between virtual transactions and real transactions carried out by way of electronic commerce. This notice also provides that virtual currency should only be used to purchase in-game items. On June 4, 2009, Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Commerce jointly issued Notice on the Reinforcement of the Administration of Virtual Currency in Online Games, which defines what virtual currency is and requires that entities obtain the approval from the Ministry of Culture before issuing virtual currency and engaging in transactions using virtual currency in connection with online games. We have obtained the approval from the Ministry of Culture for the issuing of our virtual currency. These restrictions on virtual currency may result in lower sales of our prepaid cards, and could have an adverse effect on our revenues from online business. Our business benefits from certain government tax incentives. Expiration, reduction or discontinuation of, or changes to, these incentives will increase our tax burden and reduce our net income. Shanghai Taomee, as a "software enterprise," enjoyed a full exemption from enterprise income tax, or EIT, in 2009 and 2010 and a 50% reduction in the EIT rate from 2011 to 2013. The reduced applicable EIT rate of Shanghai Taomee was 12.5% from 2011 to 2013. Shanghai Taomee's tax holiday period was approved by relevant tax authorities in May 2010. In addition, an enterprise may benefit from a preferential tax rate of 15% under the EIT Law if it qualifies as a "High and New Technology Enterprise", or HNTE. In 2010, Shanghai Taomee obtained "High and New Technology Enterprise" qualification, or HNTE qualification, which is effective for a period of three years and could be renewed thereafter. In 2013, Shanghai Taomee applied for the renewal and received a new HNTE qualification. Currently Shanghai Taomee has not applied to the relevant tax authority for preferential tax treatment as a HNTE. Shanghai Shengran, which was established in 2009 and qualified as a "software enterprise" in 2010 and was informed in April 2011 that the full EIT exemption would apply retroactively in 2009 and 2010, and 50% reduction in EIT rate will apply from 2011 to 2013. In May 2012, Shanghai Shengran received a written approval from local tax authorities, according to which Shanghai Shengran was entitled to the full EIT exemption for 2010 and 2011, and 50% reduction in EIT rate, i.e. EIT rate of 12.5%, from 2012 to 2014, which resulted in an adjustment of US$2.1 million as a one-time tax benefit in 2012. 29 Table of Contents According to the Notice of the Ministry of Finance and Other Departments regarding Several Opinions on Facilitating the Development of China's Animation Industry forwarded by the General Office of the State Council on April 25, 2006, an animation enterprise as recognized by the relevant department of the State Council which independently develops or produces animation products can apply for certain tax preferential treatment as applied to the software enterprises. Shanghai Animation was recognized as an "animation enterprise" in November 2013. Shanghai Animation is in the process of obtaining a written approval from relevant tax authorities for the two-year EIT exemption and a three-year 50% EIT rate reduction. If Shanghai Taomee, Shanghai Shengran or Shanghai Animation fail to maintain their respective qualification as a "software enterprise" or as an "animation enterprise" or as a "HNTE", the effective EIT rate will increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, various local governments in China have provided discretionary preferential tax treatments to us. However, these local governments may decide to reduce or eliminate these preferential tax treatments at any time. Furthermore, these local implementations of tax laws may be found to violate national laws or regulations and we may be subject to retroactive imposition of higher taxes as a result. Any expiration, reduction or discontinuation of, or changes to, these tax incentives will increase our tax burden and reduce our net income and thus have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Further roll-out of the PRC government's plan to replace business tax with value-added tax, or VAT, may subject us to higher tax rate, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Pursuant to the PRC Provisional Regulations on Business Tax, taxpayers providing taxable services falling under the category of service industry in China are required to pay a business tax at a normal tax rate of 5% of their revenues. In November 2011, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Pilot Plan for Imposition of Value-Added Tax to Replace Business Tax, or Circular 111, pursuant to which, from January 1, 2012, VAT has replaced business tax in the transport and shipping industry and some of the modern service industries in Shanghai. In July 2012, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Circular concerning Implementing the Pilot Plan for Imposition of Value-Added Tax to Replace Business Tax for Transport and Shipping Industry and Certain Modern Service Industries in Eight Provinces and Municipalities (including Beijing), or Circular 71, which expanded the pilot regions to other eight provinces and municipalities including Beijing, Tianjin, and Shenzhen. In May 2013, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Circular concerning Implementing the Pilot Plan for Imposition of Value-Added Tax to Replace Business Tax for Transport and Shipping Industry and Certain Modern Service Industries across the Country, or Circular 37, which expanded the pilot regions to the whole nation and Circular 111 and Circular 71 were annulled accordingly. In December 2013, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Circular on Expanding the Pilot Plan for Imposition of Value-Added Tax to Replace Business Tax to Railway Transport and Postal Service, or Circular 106, pursuant to which, from January 1, 2014, VAT would replace business tax in the transport and shipping industry, postal service and some of the modern service industries in PRC and Circular 37 was annulled accordingly. Under Circular 106, a VAT rate of 6% applies to certain modern service industries. Most of our consolidated affiliated entities are located in these pilot regions, and the revenues recognized from part of our businesses operated by Shanghai Shengran, Shanghai Taomee and Shanghai Animation are subject to VAT at a rate of 6% for certain other services such as advertisement, merchandise licensing and box office revenue sharing and 17% for software sales, while other part of our business are still subject to PRC business tax at a statutory tax rate of 5%. If this plan is extended to apply to other part of our business, we may be subject to VAT rate which is higher than the business tax rate, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations. 30 Table of Contents We principally rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiary to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiary to make payments to us, or the tax implications of making payments to us, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. We are a holding company, and we rely principally on dividends and other distributions on equity from our subsidiary in China for our cash requirements, including the funds necessary to service any debt we may incur. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends to us only out of its accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our subsidiary in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. The registered capital of Shanghai Shengran is US$2.5 million. As of the date of this annual report, Shanghai Shengran has made allocations to its statutory reserve fund in compliance with the applicable PRC laws and regulations. Furthermore, if our subsidiary in China incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us. Most of our assets are held by, and substantially all of our earnings and cash flows are attributable to, our PRC subsidiary. If earnings from our PRC subsidiary were to decline, our earnings and cash flow would be materially and adversely affected. Our cash flows are principally derived from dividends paid to us by our PRC subsidiary. As a result, our ability to distribute dividends largely depends on earnings from our PRC subsidiary and its ability to pay dividends out of its earnings. Our PRC subsidiary does not have a history of paying dividends. We cannot assure you that our PRC subsidiary will generate sufficient earnings and cash flows in the near future to pay dividends or otherwise distribute sufficient funds to enable us to meet our obligations, pay interest and expenses or declare dividends. In addition, under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and the Implementing Rules, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008, dividends generated from the business of our PRC subsidiary after January 1, 2008 and payable to us may be subject to a 10% withholding tax if the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a non-resident enterprise, unless there is an applicable tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement and we are deemed to be entitled to such favorable treatment. We may be classified as a "resident enterprise" for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, which could result in our global income becoming subject to 25% PRC enterprise income tax. The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law provides that enterprises established outside China whose "effective management" is located in China are considered "resident enterprises" and will generally be subject to the uniform 25% EIT rate as to their global income. Under the implementation regulations, "effective management" is defined as substantial and overall management and control over such aspects as the production and business, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In April 2009, the State Administration of Taxation released a circular that sets out the standards and procedures for recognizing the location of the "effective management" of an enterprise registered outside of the PRC and funded by Chinese enterprises as controlling investors, or a Chinese Funded Enterprise. Under the circular, a Chinese Funded Enterprise is considered a resident enterprise if all of the following applies: (i) a Chinese Funded Enterprise's major management department and personnel who are responsible for carrying out daily operations are located in the PRC; (ii) the department or the personnel who have the right to decide or approve the Chinese Funded Enterprise's financial and human resource matters are located in the PRC; (iii) the major assets, account book, company seal and meeting minutes of the Chinese Funded Enterprise are located or stored in the PRC; and (iv) the directors or management personnel holding no less than 50% voting rights of the Chinese Funded Enterprise habitually reside in the PRC. The circular explicitly provides that the above standards apply to the enterprises which are registered outside the PRC and funded by Chinese enterprises as 31 Table of Contents controlling investors, and therefore such standards may be cited for reference only and may not be directly adopted when considering whether our "effective management" is in the PRC or not. Accordingly, it is still uncertain whether we may be considered a resident enterprise under the PRC EIT Law. If we are considered a resident enterprise and earn income other than dividends from our PRC subsidiary, we will be subject to a 25% PRC income tax on our global income and such 25% PRC EIT on our global income could significantly increase our tax burden and materially and adversely affect our cash flow and profitability. If we are classified as a "resident enterprise" for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, you may be subject to PRC withholding tax on dividends from us and to PRC income tax on gain realized on the transfer of our ADSs or ordinary shares. Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and related implementation regulations, PRC EIT withholding tax at the rate of 10% is applicable to dividends payable to investors that are "non-resident enterprises," which do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or which have such establishment or place of business if the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends have their sources within the PRC. In addition, any gain realized on the transfer of ADSs or shares by such investors is subject to 10% PRC income tax if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within the PRC unless a treaty otherwise provides. If we are considered a PRC "resident enterprise," it is unclear whether dividends we pay with respect to our ordinary shares or ADSs, or the gain you may realize from the transfer of our ordinary shares or ADSs, would be treated as income derived from sources within the PRC and be subject to PRC tax. If we are required under the PRC EIT Law to withhold PRC income tax on dividends payable to our non-PRC investors that are "non-resident enterprises," or if you are required to pay PRC income tax on the transfer of our ordinary shares or ADSs, the value of your investment in our ordinary shares or ADSs may be materially and adversely affected. Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could have a material adverse effect on us. We conduct our business primarily through our subsidiary and affiliated entities in China. Our operations in China are governed by PRC laws and regulations. The PRC legal system is based on statutes. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, PRC legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. In particular, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published decisions and their nonbinding nature, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all) that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until some time after the violation. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our revenues effectively. Substantially all of our cash inflows and outflows are denominated in Renminbi. We may convert a portion of our revenues into other currencies to meet our foreign currency obligations such as payment of dividends declared in respect of our ordinary shares. Under China's existing foreign exchange regulations, our PRC subsidiary is able to make payments of current accounts, such as dividends to its offshore holding companies, in foreign currencies, without prior approval from SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, we cannot assure you that the PRC authorities will not take further measures in the future to restrict access to foreign currencies for current account 32 Table of Contents transactions. We may also have different views with the PRC authorities with respect to certain foreign exchange transactions. These and other uncertainties with respect to currency exchange controls may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition. Governmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment. The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We receive substantially all of our revenues in RMB. Under our current corporate structure, our income is primarily derived from dividend payments from our PRC subsidiary. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiary to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy its foreign currency denominated obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders, including holders of our ADSs. We may be subject to penalties, including restriction on our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiary and our PRC subsidiary's ability to distribute profits to us, if our PRC resident shareholders or beneficial owners fail to comply with relevant PRC foreign exchange rules. SAFE issued a public notice in October 2005 requiring PRC residents to register with the local SAFE branch before establishing or controlling any company outside of China for the purpose of capital financing with assets or equities of PRC companies, referred to in the notice as an "offshore special purpose vehicle." PRC residents that are shareholders and/or beneficial owners of offshore special purpose companies established before November 1, 2005 were required to register with the local SAFE branch before March 31, 2006. In addition, any PRC resident that is a shareholder of an offshore special purpose vehicle is required to amend its SAFE registration with respect to that offshore special purpose company in connection with any increase or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, merger, division, equity investment or creation of any security interest over any assets located in China or other material changes in share capital. In May 2007, SAFE issued relevant guidance to its local branches with respect to the operational process for SAFE registration, which standardized more specific and stringent supervision on the registration relating to the SAFE notice. All our individual shareholders who are subject to Circular 75 have completed registration with SAFE with regard to the establishment of our company or their shareholding in our company as required under Circular 75, and they have also filed application for change of registration to reflect our company's investment activities and later share subdivision. We are committed to compliance with Circular 75 and have taken steps to ensure that our shareholders and beneficial owners who are subject to Circular 75 also comply with the relevant rules. However, we cannot provide any assurance that all of our shareholders and beneficial owners who are PRC residents will comply with our request to make, obtain or update any applicable registrations or comply with other requirements required by the SAFE notice or other related rules. In case of any non-compliance on any of our PRC resident shareholders or beneficial owners, our PRC subsidiary and such shareholders and beneficial owners may be subject to fines and other legal sanctions, including restriction on our ability to contribute additional capital into our PRC subsidiary and our PRC subsidiary's ability to distribute dividends to our offshore holding companies, which will adversely affect our business. 33 Table of Contents All employee participants in our share incentive plans who are domestic individuals may be required to register with SAFE. We may also face regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our ability to adopt additional option plans for our directors and employees under PRC law. In December 2006, the People's Bank of China promulgated the Administrative Measures for Individual Foreign Exchange, which set forth the respective requirements for foreign exchange transactions by PRC individuals under either current account or the capital account. In January 2007, SAFE issued the Implementation Rules of the Administrative Measures for Individual Foreign Exchange, which, among other things, specified approval requirements for certain capital account transactions such as a PRC citizen's participation in the employee stock ownership plans or stock option plans of an overseas publicly-listed company. On February 15, 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notice regarding Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Stock Option Plan of Overseas-Listing Companies, or the Stock Option Rule, which substitutes the Application Procedure of Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Stock Holding Plan or Stock Option Plan of Overseas-Listed Companies promulgated by SAFE on March 28, 2007. Under the Stock Option Rule, the domestic individuals as defined under the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations who are granted stock options or other incentive alternatives by an overseas publicly listed company are required, through a PRC agent or PRC subsidiary of such overseas publicly listed company, to register with SAFE and complete certain other procedures. We and our relevant employees participating in our stock incentive plan are subject to the Stock Option Rule. Failure to comply with the Stock Option Rule and other relevant rules will subject us or our relevant employees participating in our stock incentive plan to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions and impose restrictions on our execution of option plans, including the grant of options under such plans to our employees, which could adversely affect our business operations. As the laws and regulations of PRC in relation to domestic individual's participation in the stock option plan of overseas companies are developing, we may also face regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our ability to adopt additional option plans for our directors and employees under PRC law. Fluctuation in the value of the RMB may have a material adverse effect on the value of your investment. The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB to the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy resulted in an over 20% appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. For almost two years after reaching a high against the U.S. dollar in July 2008, however, the Renminbi traded within a narrow band against the U.S. dollar. As a consequence, the Renminbi fluctuated sharply since July 2008 against other freely traded currencies, in tandem with the U.S. dollar. In June 2010, the PRC government announced that it would increase RMB exchange rate flexibility. However, it remains unclear how this flexibility might be implemented. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a more flexible currency policy, which could result in greater fluctuation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. Substantially all of our revenues and costs are denominated in RMB, and a significant portion of our financial assets are also denominated in RMB. We principally rely on dividends and other distributions paid to us by our subsidiary in China. Any significant revaluation of the RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues, earnings and financial position, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our ADSs in U.S. dollars. Any fluctuations of the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar could also result in foreign currency translation losses for financial reporting purposes. 34 Table of Contents The approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, may be required in connection with our initial public offering under a PRC regulation. The regulation also establishes more complex procedures for acquisitions conducted by foreign investors that could make it more difficult for us to grow through acquisitions. On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the Ministry of Commerce, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, or SASAC, the State Administration for Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the CSRC, and SAFE, jointly adopted the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the New M&A Rule, which became effective on September 8, 2006 and was amended by the Ministry of Commerce on June 22, 2009. The regulations require offshore special purpose vehicles that are controlled by PRC companies or residents and that have been formed for the purpose of seeking a public listing on an overseas stock exchange through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies or assets to obtain CSRC approval prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published a notice on its website specifying the documents and materials that special purpose vehicles are required to submit when seeking CSRC approval for their listings outside of China. The interpretation and application of the above regulations remain unclear, and the initial public offering which we completed in June , 2011 may require approval from the CSRC, and if it does, it is uncertain how long it will take us to obtain the approval. If CSRC approval is required for the initial public offering, our failure in obtaining or delay in obtaining the CSRC approval for the initial public offering would subject us to sanctions imposed by the CSRC and other PRC regulatory agencies, which could include fines and penalties on our operations in China, restrictions or limitations on our ability to pay dividends outside of China, and other forms of sanctions that may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our PRC counsel, Allbright Law Offices, has advised us that, based on their understanding of the current PRC laws, regulations and rules and the procedures announced on September 21, 2006, we will not be required to submit an application to the CSRC for the approval of the listing and trading of our ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange, because we do not constitute a special purpose vehicle, as defined by the New M&A Rules, which is required to obtain approval from the CSRC for overseas listing, and no public record is found indicating that any of the issuers having similar onshore corporate structures and already listed on an off-shore stock exchange has been required by the CSRC to procure the approval of the CSRC prior to its listing. The new regulations also established additional procedures and requirements that are expected to make merger and acquisition activities in China by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the Ministry of Commerce be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise, or that the approval from the Ministry of Commerce be obtained in circumstances where overseas companies established or controlled by PRC enterprises or residents acquire affiliated domestic companies. We may grow our business in part by acquiring other companies operating in our industry. Complying with the requirements of the new regulations to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including approval from Ministry of Commerce, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share. We face risks of health epidemics and other disasters, which could severely disrupt our business operations. Our business could be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of swine influenza, avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, or another epidemic. In March 2013, a new virus subtype H7N9, commonly known as "bird flu" or "avian flu," was discovered in eastern China and has already sickened and killed some people. Any adverse public health developments in China could 35 Table of Contents require the temporary closure of our offices. Such closures could severely disrupt our business operations and adversely affect our results of operations. Our operations are vulnerable to interruption and damage from man-made or natural disasters, including wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, fire, floods, environmental accidents, power loss, communications failures and similar events, all of which may disrupt our business. If any significant man-made or natural disaster were to occur in the future, our ability to operate our business could be seriously impaired. The enforcement of labor contract law and increase in labor costs in the PRC may adversely affect our business and our profitability. China adopted a labor contract law effective on January 1, 2008, which was amended by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on December 28, 2012, and its implementation rules effective on September 18, 2008, respectively. The labor contract law and its implementation rules impose more stringent requirements on employers with regard to, among others, minimum wages, severance payment upon permitted termination of the employment by an employer and non-fixed term employment contracts, time limits for probation period as well as the duration and the times that an employee can be placed on a fixed term employment contract. Due to the lack of clarity with respect to their implementation and potential penalties and fines, it is uncertain how they will impact our current employment policies and practices. Our employment policies and practices may violate the labor contract law or its implementation rules and we may be subject to related penalties, fines or legal fees. Compliance with the labor contract law and its implementation rules may increase our operating expenses, in particular our personnel expenses, as the continued success of our business depends significantly on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. In the event that we decide to terminate some of our employees or otherwise change our employment or labor practices, the labor contract law and its implementation rules may also limit our ability to effect those changes in a manner that we believe to be cost-effective or desirable, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Proceedings instituted by the SEC against five PRC-based accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act. In late 2012, the SEC commenced administrative proceedings under Rule 102(e) of its Rules of Practice and also under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 against the Chinese affiliates of the "big four" accounting firms, (including our auditors) and also against Dahua (the former BDO affiliate in China). The Rule 102(e) proceedings initiated by the SEC relate to these firms' inability to produce documents, including audit work papers, in response to the request of the SEC pursuant to Section 106 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as the auditors located in the PRC are not in a position lawfully to produce documents directly to the SEC because of restrictions under PRC law and specific directives issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. The issues raised by the proceedings are not specific to our auditors or to us, but affect equally all audit firms based in China and all China-based businesses with securities listed in the United States. In January 2014, the administrative judge reached an Initial Decision that the "big four" accounting firms should be barred from practicing before the Commission for six months. However, it is currently impossible to determine the ultimate outcome of this matter as the accounting firms have filed a petition for review of the Initial Decision and pending that review the effect of the Initial Decision is suspended. The SEC Commissioners will review the Initial Decision, determine whether there has been any violation and, if so, determine the appropriate remedy to be placed on these audit firms. Once such an order was made, the accounting firms would have a further right to appeal to the 36 Table of Contents US Federal courts, and the effect of the order might be further stayed pending the outcome of that appeal. Depending upon the final outcome, listed companies in the United States with major PRC operations may find it difficult or impossible to retain auditors in respect of their operations in the PRC, which could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, including possible delisting. Moreover, any negative news about the proceedings against these audit firms may cause investor uncertainty regarding China-based, United States-listed companies and the market price of our ADSs may be adversely affected. Risks Related to Our ADSs The market price for our ADSs has fluctuated and may be volatile. The market price for our ADSs has fluctuated since we first listed our ADSs. Since our ADSs became listed on the NYSE on June 10, 2011, trading price of our ADSs have ranged from US$3.15 to US$17.90 per ADS, and the last reported trading price on April 10, 2014 was US$5.80 per ADS. The market price for our ADSs may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors within and outside our control including, but not limited to, the following: actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations; regulatory developments affecting us or our industry; changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other companies operate in our industry; changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts; announcements by us or our competitors of new services, acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments; fluctuations of exchange rates between RMB and the U.S. dollar; intellectual property litigation; economic or political conditions in China; additions to or departures of our senior management; release or expiry of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding ordinary shares or ADSs; and sales or perceived potential sales of additional ordinary shares or ADSs. In addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of any particular companies. These market fluctuations may also have a material adverse effect on the market price of our ADSs. Substantial future sales or the perception of sales of our ADSs or ordinary shares in the public market could cause the price of our ADSs to decline. Additional sales of our ADSs or ordinary shares, including ADSs or ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of our outstanding stock options, in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our ADSs to decline. If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our ADSs, including those issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, in the public market, the market price of our ADSs could fall. Such sales also might make it more difficult for us to 37 Table of Contents sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. If any existing shareholder or shareholders sell a substantial amount of ordinary shares, the prevailing market price for our ADSs could be adversely affected. In addition, we may issue additional ordinary shares or ADSs. If we pay for our future acquisitions in whole or in part with additionally issued ordinary shares or ADSs, your ownership interests in our company would be diluted and this, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our ADSs. You may not have the same voting rights as the holders of our ordinary shares and must act through the depositary to exercise your rights. As an ADS holder, you may only exercise voting rights with respect to the underlying ordinary shares in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement. Under the deposit agreement, you must vote by giving voting instructions to the depositary. Upon receipt of your voting instructions, the depositary will vote the underlying ordinary shares in accordance with these instructions. Otherwise, you will not be able to exercise your right to vote unless you withdraw the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs. Pursuant to our third amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we may convene a shareholders' meeting upon ten calendar days' notice. When a shareholder's meeting is convened, you may not receive sufficient advance notice to withdraw the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs to allow you to vote with respect to any specific matter. If we give timely notice, the depositary will notify you of the upcoming vote and arrange to deliver our voting materials to you. We cannot assure you that you will receive the voting materials in time to instruct the depositary to vote the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs. In addition, the depositary and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions or for the manner of carrying out voting instructions. This means that you may not be able to exercise your right to vote and there may be nothing you can do if the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs are not voted as you requested. You may not be able to participate in rights offerings and may experience dilution of your holdings as a result. We may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities. Under the deposit agreement for the ADSs, the depositary will not offer those rights to ADS holders unless both the rights and the underlying securities to be distributed to ADS holders are registered under the Securities Act, or the distribution of them to ADS holders is exempted from registration under the Securities Act with respect to all holders of ADSs. We are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective. In addition, we may not be able to rely on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act to distribute such rights and securities. Accordingly, holders of our ADSs may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in their holdings as a result. You may be subject to limitations on transfer of your ADSs. Your ADSs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its transfer books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties. In addition, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of ADSs generally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary deem it advisable to do so due to any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body. 38 Table of Contents You may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law, conduct substantially all of our operations in China and the majority of our directors and officers reside outside the United States. We are incorporated in the Cayman Islands and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States. We conduct substantially all of our current operations in China through our subsidiary and affiliated entities in China. The majority of our officers and directors reside outside the United States and a substantial portion of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the United States in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Cayman Islands and of China may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands or the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state, and it is uncertain whether such Cayman Islands or PRC courts would be competent to hear original actions brought in the Cayman Islands or the PRC against us or such persons predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state. Our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association, as amended from time to time, and by the Companies Law (2013 Revision) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors and us, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, because the Cayman Islands law has no legislation specifically dedicated to the rights of investors in securities, and thus no statutorily defined private causes of action to investors in securities such as those found under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United States, it provides significantly less protection to investors. In addition, shareholders of Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action before the federal courts of the United States. As a result of all of the above, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management, directors or major shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation organized in a jurisdiction in the United States. Our articles of association contain anti-takeover provisions that could discourage a third party from acquiring us, which could limit our shareholders' opportunity to sell their shares, including ordinary shares represented by our ADSs, at a premium. Our third amended and restated articles of association contain provisions to limit the ability of others to acquire control of our company or cause us to engage in change-of-control transactions. These provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender offer or similar transaction. For example, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by our shareholders, to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to determine their designations, powers, preferences, privileges and other rights, including dividend rights, voting rights, conversion rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, any or all of which may be greater than the rights associated with our ordinary shares, in the form of ADS or otherwise. Preferred shares could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change 39 Table of Contents in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult. If our board of directors decides to issue preferred shares, the price of our ADSs may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares and ADSs may be materially and adversely affected. We believe we may be a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders of our ADSs or ordinary shares. Based on the market price of our ADSs and composition of our income and assets, we believe we were a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. A non-U.S. corporation will be a PFIC for any taxable year if either (i) at least 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income or (ii) at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets) during such year is attributable to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income. Because the value of our assets for purposes of the PFIC test may be determined, in part, by reference to the market price of our ADSs or ordinary shares, our PFIC status will depend in large part on the market price of the ADSs or ordinary shares, which may fluctuate significantly. Because we believe we were a PFIC for our taxable year ended December 31, 2013, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could apply to U.S. Holders (as defined in "Item 10. Additional InformationE. TaxationUnited States Federal Income Taxation") of our ADSs or ordinary shares with respect to any "excess distribution" received from us and any gain from a sale or other disposition of our ADSs or ordinary shares. See "Item 10. Additional InformationE. TaxationUnited States Federal Income TaxationPassive Foreign Investment Company." We have incurred increased costs as a result of being a public company, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional future costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. As a public company, we have incurred a significantly higher level of legal, accounting and other expenses than we did as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, have required changes in the corporate governance practices of public companies. These rules and regulations have increased our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and made some of our corporate activities more time-consuming and costly. After we became a public company, we have established additional board committees and adopted and implemented additional policies regarding internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires public companies to include a report of management on the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting, has increased our costs. In addition, we have incurred costs associated with public company reporting requirements, such as the requirements to file an annual report and other reports with the SEC. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs going forward, but we cannot predict or estimate the additional costs or the timing of initially additional costs we may incur.
