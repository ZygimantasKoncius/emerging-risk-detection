Risk Factors, and with consideration that the Argentine economy has been historically volatile, which has negatively affected the volume and growth of the financial system. Item 5.B. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity  Holding Company on an Individual Basis We generate our net earnings/losses from our operating subsidiaries, especially Banco Galicia, our main operating subsidiary. Although, from 2002 to 2010 we did not receive any dividends from Banco Galicia, it is the primary source of funds available to us. On April 27, 2011, Banco Galicias shareholders held a shareholders meeting during which they approved the distribution of cash dividends for a total amount of Ps.100.1 million. During May 2011, according to our participation of 94.84%, we received a cash dividend of Ps.94.9 million. Additionally, during 2010, we received from other subsidiaries Ps.18.8 million in cash dividends. Banco Galicias dividend-paying ability has been affected since late 2001 (and until 2010) by the effects of the 2001-2002 crisis on its liquidity and income-generation capacity. In addition, there were other restrictions on Banco Galicias ability to pay dividends resulting from applicable Argentine Central Bank rules and the loan agreements entered into by Banco Galicia as part of its foreign debt restructuring. See Item 8. Financial Information-Dividend Policy and Dividends. The extent to which a banking subsidiary may extend credit or otherwise provide funds to a holding company is limited by Argentine Central Bank rules. For a description of these rules, see Item 4. Information on the Company-Argentine Banking Regulation-Lending Limits. According to Grupo Financiero Galicias policy for the distribution of dividends and due to the fact that most of the profits for fiscal year 2010 correspond to income by holdings and just a fraction corresponds to the realized and liquid profits meeting the requirements to be distributed as per Section 68 of the Corporations Law, and taking as well into consideration Grupo Financiero Galicias financial condition and, particularly, the need to pay the outstanding foreign-currency denominated negotiable obligations issued, at the shareholders meeting held on April 27, 2011, our shareholders approved the payment of dividends in cash for Ps.24.8 million, which represents 2% with regard to 1,241,407,017 class A and B ordinary shares with a face value of Ps.1 each. -142- Table of Contents Pursuant to what is set forth in the last paragraph of the section incorporated by Act No. 25,585 after Section 25 of Act No. 23,966, as applicable, Grupo Financiero Galicia will be restored the amounts corresponding to the tax on personal assets it paid for fiscal year 2010 in its capacity as substitute taxpayer of the shareholders subject to the above-mentioned tax. As of December 31, 2010, Grupo Financiero Galicia, on an individual basis, had cash and due from banks for Ps.0.8 million and short-term investments for Ps.26.5 million. Grupo Financiero Galicias short-term investments were made up of: (i) special current account deposits for Ps.24.8 million, (ii) time deposits for Ps.0.5 million, and (iii) investments in mutual funds for Ps.1.2 million. As of December 31, 2009, Grupo Financiero Galicia, on an individual basis, had cash and due from banks for Ps.3.8 million and short-term investments for Ps.28.7 million. Grupo Financiero Galicias short-term investments were made up of: (i) special current account deposits for Ps.3.2 million, (ii) time deposits for Ps.10.6 million, (iii) investments in mutual funds for Ps.1.8 million, (iv) negotiable obligations issued by companies from abroad for Ps.5.6 million, and (v) ETFs for Ps.7.5 million. As of December 31, 2008, on a non-consolidated basis, we had cash and due from banks in the amount of Ps.0.2 million and short-term investments for Ps.27.3 million. In July 2007, in exercise of our preemptive rights, we used US$102.2 million of face value of 2014 Notes and cash to subscribe for 93.6 million shares of Banco Galicia, in the offering carried out by Banco Galicia. To fund such cash subscription we entered into an US$80 million loan agreement in July 2007, the first installment of which was repaid in July 2008, for US$24.3 million (US$18.0 million of principal and US$6.3 million in interest). On January 6, 2009, the remaining outstanding of US$62 million was cancelled in advance, with a single and final payment of US$39.1 million, with our own funds and funds from financing granted by local entities. On March 9, 2009, our shareholders held the general ordinary shareholders meeting during which they approved the creation of a global program for simple negotiable obligations, not convertible into shares, for a maximum principal amount of US$60 million. On June 4, 2009 series I and series II notes corresponding to the class I notes were issued in the amount of US$45 million. Series I, with a one-year term, was issued for a principal amount of US$34.4 million and a yield of 8%; series II, with a two-year term, was issued for a principal amount of US$10.6 million and an annual yield of 10.5%. With the proceeds of these issuances, we proceeded to cancel the funding from local entities. On April 14, 2010, Grupo Financiero Galicias shareholders held the ordinary and extraordinary shareholders meeting during which they approved an extension of US$40 million in the amount of the global program of simple short-, medium- and/or long- term negotiable obligations. Therefore, the maximum amount of the program, which was originally set at US$60 million or its equivalent in any other currency, was increased to US$100 million or its equivalent in any other currency. Furthermore, during fiscal year 2010 Grupo Financiero Galicia made an offer of negotiable obligations for a face value of US$45.0 million. The subscription period ended on June 4, 2010; the negotiable obligations were fully subscribed and Grupo Financiero Galicia decided not to issue series I, which was planned to be issued at a discount. The cut-off rate for series II was 101.82%, for a face value of US$18.1 million, equivalent to a 7% annual yield. As regards series III, the cut-off rate was 101.28%, for a face value of US$26.9 million, equivalent to an 8.5% annual yield. Accordingly, during fiscal year 2010, Grupo Financiero Galicia repaid, upon maturity, the class I, series I negotiable obligations for US$34.4 million. During 2011, Grupo Financiero Galicia repaid, upon maturity, the class I, series II negotiable obligations for US$10.6 million. Each of our subsidiaries is responsible for their own liquidity management. For a discussion of Banco Galicias liquidity management, see -Banco Galicias Liquidity Management-Banco Galicia (Unconsolidated) Liquidity Management. -143- Table of Contents Consolidated Cash Flows Our consolidated statements of cash flows were prepared using the measurement methods prescribed by the Argentine Central Bank, but in accordance with the presentation requirements of Statement of Cash Flows, ASC 230-10. See our consolidated cash flow statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010, December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, included in this annual report. As of December 31, 2010, on a consolidated basis, we had Ps.7,443.5 million in available cash (defined as total cash on hand and cash equivalents), representing a Ps.2,014.8 million increase from the Ps.5,428.7 million as of December 31, 2009. At the end of fiscal year 2009, our available cash (and cash equivalents) had increased in the amount of Ps.633.3 million from the Ps.4,795.4 million of available cash (and cash equivalents) at the end of the prior fiscal year. Effective May 14, 2007, and in accordance with the provisions of Argentine Central Banks Communiqué A 4667, cash equivalents are comprised of the following: Argentine Central Bank debt instruments (Nobac and Lebac) having a remaining maturity that does not exceed 90 days, securities in connection with reverse repurchase agreement transactions with the Argentine Central Bank, short term call loans to corporations, local interbank loans and overnight placements in correspondent banks abroad. Cash equivalents also comprise, in the case of the Regional Credit Card Companies, time deposit certificates and mutual fund shares. The table below summarizes the information from our consolidated statements of cash flows for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 which is also discussed in more detail below.

Our investing activities primarily consist of our origination of loans and other credits to the private sector. Our financing activities primarily include raising customer deposits, in addition to entering into sales of government securities under repurchase agreement transactions or not, issuing bonds in the local and foreign capital markets and borrowing from foreign and local banks and international credit agencies. In the last few years, these activities have also included reducing expensive liabilities incurred as a consequence of the 2001-2002 crisis. -144- Table of Contents As shown in the table above, and explained in more detail below, in the last three years and consistently with our strategy of strengthening our balance sheet, we have generated significant amounts of cash from our exposure to the public sector, which represents mainly Banco Galicias exposure, for approximately Ps.2,614.9 million in 2010, Ps.1,135.4 million in 2009 and Ps.782,7 million in 2008, and have used cash generated by such assets (as well as these assets directly) mainly to repay restructured foreign debt, incurred as a consequence of or related to the 2001-2002 crisis. In 2010 and 2009 funds generated by operating and financing activities were used for investing activities, mainly due to the increase in loans to the private sector. In 2008, due to the international economic crisis and its local impact, our main source of funds was funds available at the end of the fiscal year due to a decrease in loans to the private sector (in replacement of our principal source of funding: deposits). Management believes that cash flows from operations and available cash and cash equivalent balances, will be sufficient to fund our financial commitments and capital expenditures for fiscal year 2011. Cash Flows from Operating Activities In fiscal year 2010, net cash provided by operating activities exceeded our net income of Ps.408.9 million and amounted to Ps.872.2 million, due to the depreciation and amortization of intangibles assets, which represent non-cash expenses, of Ps.433.2 million, loan loss provisions, which, similarly, do not require cash at the time of provision and which, net of reversals, amounted to Ps.346.7 million and a decrease of Ps.327.8 million of government securities attributable to the increase of Ps.363.6 million of Argentine Central Bank debt instruments (Nobac and Lebac) having a remaining maturity that exceed 90 days and offset by Ps.35.8 million of other securities. In addition, net cash was provided by other fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities: (i) Ps.15.0 million of the collection of CER adjustment, (ii) Ps.104.4 million of foreign exchange brokerage, (iii) Ps.144.2 million of the liquidation corresponding to Tarjeta Naranja Financial Trust, (iv) Ps.224.1 million of collections on account of third parties and (v) Ps.723.2 million of the decrease of net other assets and liabilities. In fiscal year 2009, net cash provided by operating activities exceeded our net income of Ps.229.3 million and amounted to Ps.1,464.8 million, due to the depreciation and amortization of intangibles assets, which represent non-cash expenses, of Ps.241.5 million, loan loss provisions, which, similarly, do not require cash at the time of provision and which, net of reversals, amounted to Ps.487.6 million and a decrease of Ps.1,120.9 million of government securities attributable to sales and to the collection of amortization and interest on Boden 2012 Bonds for Ps.637.4 million, Ps.1,170.1 million of sales of securities in Pesos, net of Ps.894.2 million of Argentine Central Bank debt instruments (Nobac and Lebac) having a remaining maturity that exceed 90 days and the increase of Ps.166.6 million of trading securities. In addition, net cash was provided by other fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities: (i) Ps.6.5 million collection of CER adjustment, (ii) Ps.160.9 million of foreign exchange brokerage, (iii) Ps.17.8 million of deposit in connection with Decree No. 616, and (iv) Ps.57.0 million of the liquidation corresponding to Tarjeta Naranja Financial Trust. Cash generated from operating activities was higher than in fiscal year 2008, basically because of more sales of government securities. In fiscal year 2008, net cash provided by operating activities exceeded our net income of Ps.176.8 million and amounted to Ps.852.0 million, due to the depreciation and amortization of intangibles assets, which represent non-cash expenses, of Ps.161.3 million, loan loss provisions, which, similarly, do not require cash at the time of provision and which, net of reversals, amounted to Ps.335.7 million and a decrease of Ps.802.6 million of government securities attributable to the collection of amortization and interest on Boden 2012 Bonds for Ps.620.5 million, sales of Argentine bonds for Ps.36.8 million, sales of other securities for Ps.80.8 million and Ps.64.5 million of Argentine Central Bank debt instruments (Nobac and Lebac) having a remaining maturity that exceed 90 days. In addition, net cash was provided by other fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities: (i) Ps.113.2 million corresponding to the capitalization of CER adjustment, (ii) Ps.86.8 million of interest on repurchase agreement transactions, (iii) Ps.76.0 million of minimum presumed income tax, and (iv) Ps.79.3 million of securitization of loans which represents non-cash income. Cash generated from operating activities was lower than in fiscal year 2007, basically because of fewer sales of government securities. -145- Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities In fiscal year 2010, net cash used by investing activities amounted to Ps.2,813.1 million. This increase was mainly attributable to the increase of Ps.4,539.4 million in our private-sector loan portfolio. In addition, cash equal to Ps.391.1 million was applied to bank premises and equipment, miscellaneous and intangible assets and Ps.339.3 attributable to investments in other companies. These amounts were offset by sales and the collection of amortization and interest on Boden 2012 Bonds for Ps.1,808.6 million, Ps.487.2 million of sales of Discount Bonds, Ps.80.7 million of sales of Bonar 2015 Bonds, and Ps.80.2 million corresponding to other intangible assets. In fiscal year 2009, net cash used by investing activities increased to Ps.1,526.0 million. This increase was mainly attributable to the increase of Ps.1,185.6 million in our private-sector loan portfolio. In addition, cash equal to Ps.282.6 million was applied to bank premises and equipment, miscellaneous and intangible assets, including payments of deposits pursuant to amparo claims. Cash used by investing activities increased from 2008, as our private-sector loan portfolio increased, because of the international financial crisis and its local impact as seen on 2008. In fiscal year 2008, net cash generated by investing activities decreased to Ps.1,093.6 million. This decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease of Ps.1,501.3 million in our private-sector loan portfolio. In addition, cash equal to Ps.403.1 million was applied to bank premises and equipment, miscellaneous and intangible assets, including payments of deposits pursuant to amparo claims. Cash used by investing activities decreased from 2007, as our private-sector loan portfolio decreased, because of the international financial crisis and its local impact. Cash Flows from Financing Activities In fiscal year 2010, financing activities generated cash in the amount of Ps.3,844.6 million due to a Ps.4,180.9 million increase in deposits, corresponding to: (a) an increase of Ps.3,326.9 million in demand deposits and (b) an increase of Ps.854.0 million in time deposits. In addition, cash for Ps.211.0 million was generated by net repurchase agreement transactions and Ps.445.3 million was generated by an increase in short-term borrowings. These amounts were offset by Ps.992.5 million net decrease in long-term credit facilities, mainly corresponding to: (a) payments of interest on restructured debt, the payment of two amortization installments on debt due 2010 and the prepayment of Banco Galicias 2014 Notes for Ps.1,031.7 million, (b) payments of long-term debt for Ps.421.1 million and (c) a Ps.460.3 million net increase in funds obtained by the Regional Credit Card Companies through the issuance of negotiable obligations and long term foreign credit facilities. In fiscal year 2009, financing activities generated cash in the amount of Ps.517.9 million due to a Ps.1,838.7 million increase in deposits, corresponding to: (a) an increase of Ps.1,793.9 million in demand deposits and (b) an increase of Ps.44.8 million in time deposits, which was offset by the following: (i) a Ps.580.9 million net decrease in long term credit facilities, mainly corresponding to: (a) payments of interest on restructured debt for US$41.4 million, (b) the payment of two amortization installments on debt due 2010 for US$68.4 million, (c) the prepayment of Banco Galicias 2014 Notes for US$77.3 million, (d) a decrease of Ps.6.8 million of IFC loans and (e) a Ps.86 million net decrease in funds obtained by the Regional Credit Card Companies through the issuance of negotiable obligations; (ii) a Ps.409.3 million net decrease in repurchase agreement transactions; and (iii) a Ps.319.9 million net decrease in short-term borrowings, mainly due to the decrease in borrowings from local and foreign banks, for Ps.327.5 million. In addition, on January 7, 2009, Grupo Financiero Galicia paid in advance, through a single and final payment of US$39.1 million, the remaining balance of the loan entered into with Merrill Lynch International. In order to make the above-mentioned prepayment, Grupo Financiero Galicia used its own funds plus funds from a 180-day loan entered into with Sudamericana on January 6, 2009 for the amount of Ps.97 million. On March 9, 2009 Grupo Financiero Galicias shareholders, at their ordinary shareholders meeting, approved the creation of a negotiable obligation program for up to US$60 million. The CNV approved said program on April 29, 2009, and, on May 9, 2009, also approved a pricing supplement for the offering of negotiable obligations for up to US$45 million. See Item 5.A. Operating Results-Funding-Debt Programs. On June 4, 2009, Grupo Financiero Galicia issued two bonds amounting to US$45 million: (i) US$34.4 million of non-interest bearing bonds due on May 30, 2010, these bonds were issued at a price of 92.68/100 and their yield will be 8%, and (ii) US$10.6 million of bonds with a 12.5% coupon, due on May 25, 2011, these bonds were issued at a price of 103.48/100 and their yield will be 10.5%. Interest on the bonds noted in (ii) is payable semiannually. With the proceeds of said bonds, Grupo Financiero Galicia cancelled the bridge loan that it had entered with Sudamericana on January 6, 2009. -146- Table of Contents In fiscal year 2008, financing activities used cash in the amount of Ps.1,065.6 million, mainly due to: (i) a Ps.474.0 million net decrease in long term credit facilities, mainly corresponding to: (a) the payments of interest on restructured debt for US$49 million, (b) the payment of two amortization installments on debt due 2010 for US$68.4 million, (c) the prepayment of Banco Galicias 2014 Notes for US$30.2 million, (d) the reduction of US$24.6 million of Galicia Uruguays restructured debt structured as negotiable obligations, (e) the increase of Ps.153.6 million of IFC loans and (f) the Ps.80.5 million net decrease in funds obtained by the Regional Credit Card Companies through the issuance of negotiable obligations; (ii) a Ps.376.6 million net decrease in repurchase agreement transactions; (iii) a Ps.156.6 million net decrease in short-term borrowings, mainly due to: (a) the decrease in borrowings from local and foreign banks, for Ps.81.0 million and (b) the payment of US$24.0 million as part of a US$80 million loan granted to us in last year; and (iv) a Ps.57.0 million decrease in deposits, corresponding to: (a) a decrease of Ps.908.4 million in time deposits and (b) an increase of Ps.868.1 million in demand deposits. For a description of the types of financial interests we use and the maturity profile of our debt, currency and interest rate structure, see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Item 5.A. Operating Results. Banco Galicias Liquidity Management Banco Galicia Consolidated Liquidity Gaps Liquidity risk is the risk that liquid assets are not available for Banco Galicia to meet financial commitments at contractual maturity, take advantage of potential investment opportunities and meet demand for credit. To monitor and control liquidity risk, Banco Galicia monitors and systematically calculates the gaps between financial assets and liabilities maturing within set time intervals based on contractual remaining maturity, on a consolidated basis with the Regional Credit Card Companies and CFA. All of the deposits in current accounts and other demand deposits and deposits in savings accounts are included in the first time interval. These figures are used to simulate different liquidity crisis scenarios based on assumptions stemming from historical experience. As of December 31, 2010, the consolidated gaps between maturities of Banco Galicias financial assets and liabilities based on contractual remaining maturity were as follows As of December 31, 2010(1) Less than one Year 1 - 5 Years 5 - 10 Years Over 10 Years Total (in millions of Pesos, except ratios) Assets Cash and Due from Banks 1,730.1    1,730.1 Argentine Central Bank  Escrow Accounts 4,283.9    4,283.9 Overnight Placements 215.3    215.3 Loans  Public Sector 2.0    2.0 Loans  Private Sector 17,444.3 3,256.4 163.0 13.0 20,876.7 Government Securities 2,043.6 643.2   2,686.8 Negotiable Obligations and Corporate Securities 45.8 23.6 7.1  76.5 Financial Trusts 411.4 308.4 270.0  989.8 Special Fund Former Almafuerte Bank 0.0 164.7   164.7 Other Financing 9.5    9.5 Assets under Financial Lease 162.4 263.6 43.1  469.1 Other 359.4    359.4 Total Assets 26,707.7 4,659.9 483.2 13.0 31,863.8 Liabilities Savings Accounts 6,190.0    6,190.0 Demand Deposits 6,018.8    6,018.8 Time Deposits 9,896.9 35.1 0.1 0.1 9,932.2 Negotiable Obligations 554.4 1,201.0   1,755.4 International Banks and Credit Agencies 476.6 226.5   703.1 Domestic Banks 357.2 342.4 12.8 0.1 712.5 Other Liabilities (1) 4,255.2 397.6   4,652.8 Total Liabilities 27,749.1 2,202.6 12.9 0.2 29,964.8 Asset / Liability Gap (1,041.4 ) 2,457.3 470.3 12.8 1,899.0 Cumulative Gap (1,041.4 ) 1,415.9 1,886.2 1,899.0 1,899.0 Ratio of Cumulative Gap to Cumulative Liabilities (3.8 )% 4.7 % 6.3 % 6.3 % Ratio of Cumulative Gap to Total Liabilities (3.5 )% 4.7 % 6.3 % 6.3 % Principal plus CER adjustment. Does not include interest. (1) Includes, mainly, debt with retailers due to credit card operations, liabilities in connection with repurchase transactions, debt with domestic credit agencies and collections for third parties. The Less than One Year bucket also includes Ps.6.7 million corresponding to Banco Galicias foreign debt not tendered by its holders in the exchange offered to restructure such foreign debt, which was completed in May 2004. -147- Table of Contents The table above is prepared taking into account contractual maturity. Therefore, all financial assets and liabilities with no maturity date are included in the Less than 1 Year category. Banco Galicia must comply with a maximum limit set by its board of directors for liquidity mismatches. This limit has been established at -25% (minus 25%) for the ratio of cumulative gap to total liabilities within the first year. As shown in the table above, Banco Galicia complies with the established policy, since such gap was -3.5% (minus 3.5%) as of December 31, 2010. Banco Galicia (Unconsolidated) Liquidity Management The following is a discussion of Banco Galicias liquidity management, excluding the consolidated companies. Banco Galicias policy is to maintain a level of liquid assets that allows it to meet financial commitments at contractual maturity, take advantage of potential investment opportunities, and meet customers credit demand. To set the appropriate level, forecasts are made based on historical experience and on an analysis of possible scenarios. This enables management to project funding needs and alternative funding sources, as well as excess liquidity and placement strategies for such funds. As of December 31, 2010, Banco Galicias unconsolidated liquidity structure was as follows: As of December 31, 2010 (in millions of Pesos) Legal Requirement Ps. 4,861.1 Management Liquidity 2,647.5 Total Liquidity (1) Ps. 7,508.6 (1) Excludes cash and due from banks of consolidated companies. The legal liquidity requirements in the table above correspond to the Minimum Cash Requirements for Peso- and Dollar-denominated liabilities determined by Argentine Central Bank regulations. For more information on the Argentine Central Bank regulations regarding reserve requirements for liquidity purposes, see Item 4. Information on the Company-Argentine Banking Regulation-Legal Reserve Requirements for Liquidity Purposes. The assets included in this calculation are technical cash, which consists of bills and coins, the balances of Peso- and Dollar-denominated deposit accounts at the Argentine Central Bank and escrow accounts held at the Argentine Central Bank in favor of clearing houses. Management liquidity consists of the following items: (i) 100% of the balance of overnight placements in banks abroad, (ii) the net amount of the margin requirement for short-term loans (call loans) to highly-rated companies, (iii) 90% of the Lebac balance, (iv) 100% of the market value of available government securities, due to the potential liquidity that might be obtained through sales or repurchase transactions, (v) net short-term interbank loans (call loans), and (vi) 100% of the balance at the Argentine Central Bank, including escrow accounts in favor of clearing houses, in excess of the amounts necessary to cover the Minimum Cash Requirements. During the shareholders meeting of Banco Galicia held on April 27, 2011, Banco Galicias shareholders approved the proposal of its board of directors in connection with the payment of a cash dividend for Ps.100.1 million. This proposal was previously authorized by the Superintendency, required by regulations in force established by the Argentine Central Bank. From said dividend, the personal asset tax corresponding to fiscal year 2010 will be withheld, at the appropriate time. -148- Table of Contents Capital Our capital management policy is designed to ensure prudent levels of capital. The following table analyzes our capital resources as of the dates indicated. As of December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions of Pesos, except ratios, multiples and percentages) Shareholders Equity Ps. 2,469.5 Ps. 2,052.5 Ps. 1,845.7 Shareholders Equity as a Percentage of Total Assets 6.92 % 7.44 % 7.46 % Total Liabilities as a Multiple of Total Shareholders Equity 13.46 x 12.45 x 12.40 x Tangible Shareholders Equity (1) as a Percentage of Total Assets 5.64 % 5.36 % 5.17 % (1) Tangible shareholders equity represents shareholders equity minus intangible assets.

Nasdaq Corporate Governance Standards Pursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5615(a) (3), a foreign private issuer may follow home country corporate governance practices in lieu of the requirements of the Rule 5600 Series, provided that the foreign private issuer complies with certain sections of the Rule 5000 Series, discloses each requirement that it does not follow and describes the home relevant country practice followed in lieu of such requirement. The requirements of the Rule 5000 Series and the Argentine corporate governance practice that we follow in lieu thereof are described below: (i) Rule 5250 (d)  Distribution of Annual and Interim Reports. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5250 (d), we follow Argentine law, which requires that companies make public a Spanish language annual report, including annual audited consolidated financial statements, by filing such annual report with the CNV and the BASE, within 70 calendar days of the end of the companys fiscal year. Interim reports must be filed with the CNV and the BASE within 42 calendar days of the end of each fiscal quarter. The BASE publishes the annual reports and interim reports in the BASE bulletin and makes the bulletin available for inspection at its offices. In addition, our shareholders can receive copies of our annual reports and any interim reports upon such shareholders request. English language translations of our annual reports and interim reports are furnished to the SEC. We also post the English language translation of our annual reports and quarterly press releases on our website. Furthermore, under the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement, dated as of June 22, 2000, among us, The Bank of New York, as depositary, and owners of ADSs issued thereunder, we are required to furnish The Bank of New York with, among other things, English language translations of our annual reports and each of our -163- Table of Contents quarterly press releases. Annual reports and quarterly press releases are available for inspection by ADRs holders at the offices of The Bank of New York located at, 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York. Finally, Argentine law requires that 20 calendar days before the date of a shareholders meeting, the board of directors must provide to the shareholders, at the companys executive office or through electronic means, all information relevant to the shareholders meeting, including copies of any documents to be considered by the shareholders (which includes the annual report), as well as proposals of the companys board of directors. (ii) Rule 5605 (b) (1)  Majority of Independent Directors. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5605 (b) (1), we follow Argentine law, which does not require that a majority of the board of directors be comprised of independent directors. Argentine law instead requires that public companies in Argentina such as us must have a sufficient number of independent directors to be able to form an audit committee of at least three members, the majority of which must be independent pursuant to the criteria established by the CNV. In addition, because we are a controlled company as defined in Rule 5615 (c) (1), we are relying on the exemption provided thereby for purposes of complying with Rule 5615 (c) (2). (iii) Rule 5605 (b) (2)  Executive Sessions of Independent Directors. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5605 (b) (2), we follow Argentine law which does not require independent directors to hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only such independent directors are present (i.e., executive sessions). Our Board of Directors as a whole is responsible for monitoring our affairs. In addition, under Argentine law, the board of directors may approve the delegation of specific responsibilities to designated directors or non-director managers of the company. Also, it is mandatory for public companies to form a supervisory committee (composed of syndics), which is responsible for monitoring the legality of the companys actions under Argentine law and the conformity thereof with its by-laws. Finally, our audit committee has regularly scheduled meetings and, as such, such meetings will serve a substantially similar purpose as executive sessions. (iv) Rule 5605 (d)  Compensation of Officers. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5605 (d), we follow Argentine law, which does not require companies to form a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. It also is not required in Argentine law that the compensation of the chief executive officer and all other executive officers be determined by either a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. Under Argentine law, the board of directors is the corporate body responsible for determining the compensation of the chief executive officer and all other executive officers, so long as they are not directors. In addition, under Argentine law, the audit committee shall give its opinion about the reasonableness of managements proposals on fees and option plans for directors or managers of the company. Finally, because we are a controlled company as defined in Rule 5615 (c) (1), we are relying on the exemption provided thereby for purposes of complying with Rule 5615 (c) (2). (v) Rule 5605 (e) (1)  Nomination of Directors. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5605 (e) (1), we follow Argentine law which requires that directors be nominated directly by the shareholders at the shareholders meeting and that they be selected and recommended by the shareholders themselves. Under Argentine law, it is the responsibility of the ordinary shareholders meeting to appoint and remove directors and to set their compensation. In addition, because we are a controlled company as defined in Rule 5615 (c) (1), we are relying on the exemption provided thereby for purposes of complying with Rule 5615 (c) (2). (vi) Rule 5605 (c) (1)  Audit Committee Charter. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5605 (c) (1), we follow Argentine law, which requires that audit committees have a charter but does not require that companies certify as to the adoption of the charter nor does it require an annual review and assessment thereof. Argentine law instead requires that companies prepare a proposed plan or course of action with respect to those matters, which are the responsibility of the companys audit committee. Such plan or course of action could, at the discretion of our audit committee, include a review and assessment of the audit committee charter. -164- Table of Contents (vii) Rule 5605 (c) (2)  Audit Committee Composition. Argentine law does not require, and it is equally not customary business practice in Argentina, that companies have an audit committee comprised solely of independent directors. Argentine law instead requires that companies establish an audit committee with at least three members comprised of a majority of independent directors as defined by Argentine law. Nonetheless, although not required by Argentine law, we have a three member audit committee comprised of entirely independent directors, as independence is defined in Rule 10 A-3 (b) (1), one of which the Board of Directors has determined to be an audit committee financial expert. In addition, we have a supervisory committee (comisión fiscalizadora) composed of three syndics, which are in charge of monitoring the legality, under Argentine law, of the actions of our board of directors and the conformity of such actions with our by-laws. (viii) Rule 5620 (c)  Quorum. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5620 (c), we follow Argentine law and our bylaws, which distinguish between ordinary meetings and extraordinary meetings and require, in connection with ordinary meetings, that a quorum consist of a majority of stock entitled to vote. If no quorum is present at the first meeting, a second meeting may be called at which the shareholders present, whatever their number, constitute a quorum and resolutions may be adopted by an absolute majority of the votes present. Argentine law and our bylaws require, in connection with extraordinary meetings, that a quorum consist of 60% of the stock entitled to vote. However, if such quorum is not present at the first meeting, our bylaws provide that a second meeting may be called which may be held with the number of shareholders present. In both ordinary and extraordinary meetings, decisions are adopted by an absolute majority of votes present at the meeting, except for certain fundamental matters (such as mergers and spin-offs (when we are not the surviving entity and the surviving entity is not listed on any stock exchange), anticipated liquidation, a change in our domicile to outside of Argentina, total or partial recapitalization of our statutory capital following a loss, any transformation in our corporate legal form or a substantial change in our corporate purpose) which require an approval by vote of the majority of all the stock entitled to vote (all stock being entitled to only one vote). (ix) Rule 5620 (b)  Solicitation of Proxies. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5620 (b), we follow Argentine law which requires that notices of shareholders meetings be published, for five consecutive days, in the Official Gazette and in a widely circulated newspaper in Argentina no earlier than 45 calendar days prior to the meeting and at least 20 calendar days prior to such meeting. In order to attend a meeting and be listed on the meeting registry, shareholders are required to submit evidence of their book-entry share account held at Caja de Valores S.A. (Caja de Valores) up to three business days prior to the scheduled meeting date. If entitled to attend the meeting, a shareholder may be represented by proxy (properly executed and delivered with a certified signature) granted to any other person, with the exception of a director, syndic, member of the surveillance committee (consejo de vigilancia), manager or employee of the issuer, which are prohibited by Argentine law from acting as proxies. In addition, our ADRs holders receive, prior to the shareholders meeting, a notice listing the matters on the agenda, a copy of the annual report and a voting card. (x) Rule 5630 (a)  Conflicts of Interest. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5630 (a), we follow Argentine law which requires that related party transactions be approved by the audit committee when the transaction exceeds one percent (1%) of the corporations net worth, measured pursuant to the last audited balance sheet, so long as the relevant transaction exceeds the equivalent of three hundred thousand Argentine Pesos (Ps.300,000). Directors can contract with the corporation only on terms consistent with prevailing market terms. If the contract is not in accordance with prevailing market terms, such transaction must be pre-approved by the board of directors (excluding the interested director). In addition, under Argentine law, a shareholder is required to abstain from voting on a business transaction in which its interests may be in conflict with the interests of the company. In the event such shareholder votes on such business transaction and such business transaction would not have been approved without such shareholders vote, such shareholder may be liable to the company for damages and the resolution may be declared void. Other than as noted above, we are in full compliance with all other applicable Nasdaq corporate governance standards. -165- Table of Contents Share Ownership For information on the share ownership of our directors and executive officers as of December 31, 2010, see Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions-Major Shareholders.

Members of the Escasany family have been on the board of directors of Banco Galicia since 1923. The Ayerza and Braun families have been represented on Banco Galicias board of directors since 1943 and 1947, respectively. Currently, there is one member of these families on Banco Galicias board of directors and five members of these families on our Board of Directors. In addition, there is one alternate director on our Board of Directors that is member of the controlling families. On September 13, 1999, the controlling shareholders of Banco Galicia formed EBA Holding S.A., an Argentine corporation, which is 100% owned by our controlling shareholders. EBA Holding holds 100% of our class A shares. Currently, EBA Holding only has class A shares outstanding. EBA Holdings bylaws provide for certain restrictions on the sale or transfer of its class A shares. While the class A shares of EBA Holding may be transferred to any other class A shareholder of EBA Holding, any transfer of such class A shares to third parties would automatically result in the conversion of the sold shares into class B shares of EBA Holding having one vote per share. In addition, EBA Holdings bylaws contain rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions and tag-along rights. A public shareholder of Banco Galicia, who indirectly owns approximately 4.5% of the outstanding capital stock of Banco Galicia, has granted a right of first refusal for the purchase of all or part of its shares to certain of our controlling shareholders in the event such public shareholder decides to sell all or part of its Banco Galicia shares.

The Corporations Law and the Argentine Central Banks regulations allow directors of a limited liability company to enter into a transaction with such company if such transaction follows prevailing market conditions. Additionally, a banks total financial exposure to related individuals or legal entities is subject to the regulations of the Argentine Central Bank. Such regulations set limits on the amount of financial exposure that can be extended by a bank to affiliates based on, among other things, a percentage of a banks RPC. See Item 4. Information on the Company-Argentine Banking Regulation-Lending Limits. Banco Galicia is required by the Argentine Central Bank to present to its board of directors, on a monthly basis, the outstanding amounts of financial assistance granted to directors, controlling shareholders, officers and other related entities, which are transcribed in the minute books of the board of directors of Banco Galicia. The Argentine Central Bank establishes that the financial assistance to directors, controlling shareholders, officers and other related entities must be granted on an equal basis with respect to rates, tenor and guarantees as loans granted to the general public. In this section total financial exposure comprises equity interests and financial assistance (all credit related items such as loans, holdings of corporate debt securities without quotation, guarantees granted and unused balances of loans granted, among others), as this term is defined in Item
