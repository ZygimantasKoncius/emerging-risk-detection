D. Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry Our results of operations are subject to cyclicality and volatility affecting both our raw material prices and our selling prices. Our business is largely dependent on the cost and supply of corn, soy meal, soybeans, hogs, cattle, milk and other raw materials, as well as the selling prices of our poultry, pork, beef and dairy products, all of which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand, which may fluctuate significantly, and other factors over which we have little or no control. These other factors include, among others, fluctuations in local and global poultry, hog, cattle and milk production levels, environmental and conservation regulations, economic conditions, weather, animal and crop diseases, cost of international freight and exchange rate fluctuations. Our industry, both in Brazil and abroad, is also characterized by cyclical periods of higher prices and profitability, followed by overproduction, leading to periods of lower prices and profitability. We are not able to mitigate these risks by entering into long-term contracts with our customers and most of our suppliers because such contracts are not customary in our industry. Our financial performance is also affected by domestic and international freight costs, which are vulnerable to volatility in the price of oil. We may not be successful in addressing the effects of cyclicality and volatility on costs and expenses or the pricing of our products, and our overall financial performance may be adversely affected. The volatility of prices of our key materials has continued since the global economic crisis of 2008 and 2009. In 2012, the average corn price in Brazil was 5.0% higher than the average corn price in 2011, and prices were considerably higher during parts of the year. For example, corn prices in December 2012 were 26.3% higher than in December 2011. In 2012, the average Soybean meal price in Brazil was 61.4% higher than the average price in 2011, and comparing December 2011 to December 2012, soybean meal prices in Brazil were up by 95.9%. We have found it necessary, at times, to increase our selling prices of products in order to mitigate the impact of the increase in the costs of our raw materials. Health risks related to the food industry could adversely affect our ability to sell our products We are subject to risks affecting the food industry generally, including risks posed by contamination or food spoilage, evolving nutritional and health-related concerns, consumer product liability claims, product tampering, the possible unavailability and expense of liability insurance and the potential cost and disruption of a product recall. Among such risks are those related to raising animals, including disease and adverse weather conditions. Meat is subject to contamination during processing and distribution. Contamination during processing could affect a large number of our products and therefore could have a significant impact on our operations. Our sales are dependent on consumer preferences and any actual or perceived health risks associated with our products, including any adverse publicity concerning these risks, could cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products, reducing the level of consumption of those products. Even if our own products are not affected by contamination, our industry may face adverse publicity if the products of other producers become contaminated, which could result in reduced consumer demand for our products in the affected category. We maintain systems designed to monitor food safety risks throughout all stages of the production process (including the production of poultry, hogs, cattle and dairy products). Our systems for compliance with governmental regulations may not be fully effective in mitigating risks related to food safety. Any product contamination could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 13 Table Of Contents Deterioration of general economic conditions could negatively impact our business. Our business may be adversely affected by changes in Brazilian and global economic conditions. Our business was materially affected by the global economic crisis, which resulted in increased volatility in our markets and contributed to net losses in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in the first half of 2009. For instance, the global economic crisis led to an increase in raw material prices, such as corn and soybeans, which we could not pass on to our customers. In addition, there was a sharp decrease in demand in 2009, which forced us to cut 20.0% of our meat production for export in the first quarter of 2009. Although Brazilian and global economic conditions generally improved in 2010, the European sovereign debt crisis led to a significant slowdown in economic activity in Europe in 2011, increasing unemployment rates and decreasing meat consumption. Conditions continued to be challenging in 2012, with exports of Brazilian chicken to Europe and certain areas of the Middle East continued to decline, and exports of Brazilian pork to Argentina, Venezuela and certain other countries also declined. In Japan and the Middle East, the oversupply cause a decrease in prices and volumes, compromising our profitability. Although our net sales from exports increased in 2012, our operating margins declined significantly due to increases in production costs. Because of the global nature of our business, we remain subject to the risk of economic volatility worldwide, and economic and political disruptions around the world can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Raising animals and meat processing involve animal health and disease control risks, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Our operations involve raising poultry and hogs and processing meat from poultry, hogs and cattle, as well as the purchase of milk and the sale of milk and dairy products, which require us to maintain animal health and control disease. We could be required to destroy animals or suspend the sale of some of our products to customers in Brazil and abroad in the event of an outbreak of disease affecting animals, such as the following: (1) in the case of poultry, avian influenza (discussed below) and Newcastle disease; (2) in the case of hogs, cattle and certain other animals, foot-and-mouth disease and A(H1N1) influenza (discussed below); and (3) in the case of cattle, foot-and-mouth disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, known as “mad cow disease.” Destruction of poultry, hogs or other animals would preclude recovery of costs incurred in raising or purchasing these animals and result in additional expense for the disposal of such animals. An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease could have an effect on livestock we own, the availability of livestock for purchase, consumer perception of certain protein products or our ability to access certain markets, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, although Brazilian cattle is generally grass-fed and at less risk of contracting mad cow disease than cattle raised in some other countries, increases in Brazilian cattle production could lead to the use of cattle feed containing animal byproducts that could heighten the risk of an outbreak of mad cow disease. Outbreaks, or fears of outbreaks, of any of these or other animal diseases may lead to cancellation of orders by our customers and, particularly if the disease has the potential to affect humans, create adverse publicity that may have a material adverse effect on consumer demand for our products. Moreover, outbreaks of animal disease in Brazil may result in foreign governmental action to close export markets to some or all of our products, relating to some or all of our regions. For example, due to foot-and-mouth disease cases affecting cattle in the States of Mato Grosso do Sul and Paraná, certain major export markets, including Russia (which has been the largest importer of Brazilian pork) banned imports of pork from the entire country in November 2005. Russia partially lifted this ban in the second quarter of 2006 for pork products from the State of Rio Grande do Sul, and this ban was completely lifted in December 2008. However, in 2011, Russia prohibited imports from several Brazilian states, citing health and sanitary reasons, and this ban remains in place. Any future outbreaks of animal diseases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our pork business in our Brazilian and export markets could be negatively affected by concerns about A(H1N1) influenza In 2009, A(H1N1) influenza, spread to many countries. On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization, or “WHO,” declared a flu alert level six, signaling a “global pandemic.” Many countries, including Russia and China, prohibited imports of pork from countries reporting a significant number of cases (Mexico, United States and Canada). On August 10, 2010, the WHO terminated the level six influenza pandemic alert and shifted its focus to a post-pandemic period. During this period, localized outbreaks of different magnitudes may show significant levels of A(H1N1) transmission. In China, for instance, at least 20 people died of A(H1N1) influenza in 2011. 14 Table Of Contents Any further outbreak of A(H1N1) influenza could lead to the imposition of costly preventive controls on pork imports in our export markets and could have a negative impact on the consumption of pork in those markets or in Brazil. In addition, any future significant outbreak of A(H1N1) influenza in Brazil could lead to pressure to destroy our hogs, even though no link between the influenza cases and pork consumption has been shown. Any such destruction of our hogs would result in decreased sales of pork, prevent recovery of costs incurred in raising or purchasing our hogs, and result in additional expense for the disposal of destroyed hogs. Accordingly, any spread of A(H1N1) influenza, or increasing concerns about this disease, may have a material and adverse effect on our company. Our poultry business in Brazilian and export markets could be negatively affected by avian influenza. Chicken and other birds in some countries, particularly in Asia but also in Europe and Africa, have become infected by highly pathogenic avian influenza (the H5N1 virus). In a small number of cases, the avian influenza has been transmitted from birds to humans, resulting in illness and, on occasion, death. Accordingly, health authorities in many countries have taken steps to prevent outbreaks of this viral disease, including destruction of afflicted poultry flocks. Since 2003, there have been over 622 confirmed human cases of avian influenza and over 371 deaths, according to the WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization, or “FAO.” Various countries in Asia, the Middle East and Africa reported human cases in the past five years, and several countries in Europe reported cases of avian influenza in birds. For example, Indonesia became the focus of international attention when the largest cluster of human H5N1 virus cases so far was identified. The H5N1 virus is considered firmly entrenched in poultry throughout much of Indonesia, and this widespread presence has resulted in a significant number of human cases. In addition, in late 2011, China suspended supplies of live poultry to Hong Kong after a dead chicken tested positive for avian influenza. In 2011, 62 cases were reported worldwide, with 34 deaths, according to the WHO. To date, Brazil has not had a documented case of avian influenza, although there are concerns that an outbreak of avian influenza may occur in the country in the future. Any outbreak of avian influenza in Brazil could lead to required destruction of our poultry flocks, which would result in decreased sales of poultry by us, prevent recovery of costs incurred in raising or purchasing such poultry, and result in additional expense for the disposal of destroyed poultry. In addition, any outbreak of avian influenza in Brazil would likely lead to immediate restrictions on the export of some of our products to key export markets. Preventive actions adopted by Brazilian authorities, if any, may not be effective in precluding the spread of avian influenza within Brazil. Whether or not an outbreak of avian influenza occurs in Brazil, further outbreaks of avian influenza anywhere in the world could have a negative impact on the consumption of poultry in our key export markets or in Brazil, and a significant outbreak would negatively affect our net sales and overall financial performance. Any outbreak could lead to the imposition of costly preventive controls on poultry imports in our export markets. Accordingly, any spread of avian influenza, or increasing concerns about this disease, may have a material and adverse effect on our company. More stringent trade barriers in key export markets may negatively affect our results of operations. Because of the growing market share of Brazilian poultry, pork and beef products in the international markets, Brazilian exporters are increasingly being affected by measures taken by importing countries to protect local producers. The competitiveness of Brazilian companies has led certain countries to establish trade barriers to limit the access of Brazilian companies to their markets. Trade barriers can consist of both tariffs and non-tariff barriers. In our industry, non-tariff barriers are a particular concern, especially sanitary and technical restrictions. Moreover, the recent global crisis has led to a rise in protectionist measures around the world, as national governments have attempted to alleviate the pressures of global economic conditions on their citizens. 15 Table Of Contents Some countries, such as Russia, have a history of erecting trade barriers to imports of food products. Since 2006, Russia has imposed quotas on Brazilian pork, beef and poultry products. Over the last two years, the Russian government has changed the allocation criteria for these quotas (particularly for pork and poultry products), which has negatively affected Brazil’s total export volume. Russia is also developing its local production capabilities and increasing quantitative restrictions. In 2011, Russia prohibited imports from several Brazilian states for health and sanitary reasons, which has also decreased Brazil’s total export volume. Currently, several restrictions on Brazilian exports remain, and Russia has intensified non-tariff requirements. We have been affected by trade barriers imposed by a number of other countries from time to time. In June 2011, South Africa initiated an anti-dumping investigation against Brazilian chicken, specifically whole chicken and boneless cuts. In a preliminary determination, the South African government imposed substantial tariffs on these products (62.9% on whole chicken and 46.5% on boneless cuts), which temporarily halted Brazilian imports. Although the final resolution of the investigation, announced in December 2012, withdrew those tariffs, there are strong indications that in 2013 the South African government will increase rates for all exporting countries equally (as opposed to anti-dumping measures targeted at Brazil), largely because of pressure from local producers. In 2009, Ukraine initiated an anti-dumping investigation. Although the investigation was eventually halted and Brazil is once again permitted to export poultry and pork to that country, Ukraine announced in the second half of 2012 that it would increase tariffs for several products, including meats. Although these tariffs have not yet been implemented, we expect that these increases may occur in 2013. In addition, at the end of 2011, Iraq introduced barriers to Brazilian chicken exports, and during 2012, Argentina imposed restrictions, such as embargos and administrative barriers, on Brazilian pork exports. In Europe, another of our key markets, the European Union has adopted a quota system for certain chicken products and prohibitive tariffs for certain products that do not have quotas in order to mitigate the effects of Brazil’s lower production costs on local producers over European producers. In addition, the European Union has a ban on certain types of Brazilian meat, including pork, fresh cuts and some premium cuts of frozen beef backs. Moreover, several countries have temporarily suspended, against the recommendations of the OIE, imports of Brazilian beef due to the Bovine Spongiform Encephalophy (“BSE”) case in early 2013. Developed countries also use direct and indirect subsidies to enhance the competitiveness of their producers in other markets. For example, French producers receive subsidies for their sales of poultry to countries such as Saudi Arabia, a major importer of poultry products. Trade barriers are sometimes applied indirectly to other parties that are crucial to the export of our products. In addition, local producers in a specific market may exert political pressure on their governments to prevent foreign producers from exporting to their market, particularly during unfavorable economic conditions. Any of the above restrictions could substantially affect our export volumes and, consequently, our export sales and financial performance. If new trade barriers arise in our key export markets, we may face difficulties in reallocating our products to other markets on favorable terms, and our business, financial condition and results of operations might be adversely affected. We face significant competition from Brazilian and foreign producers, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We face strong competition from other Brazilian producers in our domestic markets and from Brazilian and foreign producers in our export markets. The Brazilian market for whole poultry, poultry cuts and pork cuts is highly fragmented. Small producers can also be important competitors, some of which operate in the informal economy and are able to offer lower prices by meeting lower quality standards. Competition from small producers is a primary reason why we sell most of our frozen (in natura) meat products in the export markets and is a barrier to expanding our sales of those products in the domestic market. With respect to exports, we compete with other large, vertically integrated Brazilian producers that have the ability to produce quality products at low cost, as well as with foreign producers. In addition, the potential growth of the Brazilian domestic market for processed food, poultry, pork and beef and Brazil’s low production costs are attractive to international competitors. Although the main barrier to these companies has been the need to build a comprehensive distribution network and a network of outgrowers, international competitors with significant resources could undertake to build these networks or acquire and expand existing networks. 16 Table Of Contents In the Brazilian dairy products markets, our main competitors are Nestlé Brasil Ltda., Danone Ltda., LBR (Lácteos Brasil S.A.) and Vigor Alimentos S.A., an affiliate of JBS S.A. To varying degrees, our competitors may have strengths in specific product lines and regions as well as greater financial resources. In addition, our poultry and pork cuts, in particular, are highly price-competitive and sensitive to product substitution. Even if we remain a low-cost producer, customers may seek to diversify their sources of supply by purchasing a portion of the products they need from producers in other countries, as some of our customers in key export markets have begun to do. We expect that we will continue to face strong competition in all of our markets and anticipate that existing or new competitors may broaden their product lines and extend their geographic scope. Any failure by us to respond to product, pricing and other moves by competitors may negatively affect our financial performance. Increased regulation of food safety could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations. Our manufacturing facilities and products are subject to regular Brazilian federal, state and local, as well as foreign, governmental inspections and extensive regulation in the food safety area, including governmental food processing controls. Changes in government regulations relating to food safety could require us to make additional investments or incur other costs to meet the necessary specifications for our products. Our products are often inspected by foreign food safety officials, and any failure to pass those inspections can result in our being required to return all or part of a shipment to Brazil, destroy all or part of a shipment or incur costs because of delays in delivering products to our customers. Any tightening of food safety regulations could result in increased costs and could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our export sales are subject to a broad range of risks associated with international operations. Export sales account for a significant portion of our net sales, representing approximately 40.4% of our net sales in 2010, 40.0% in 2011 and 41.6% in 2012. Our major export markets include the European Union, the Middle East (particularly Saudi Arabia) and the Far East (particularly Japan, China, Russia and Ukraine), where we are subject to many of the same risks described below in relation to Brazil. Our future financial performance will depend, to a significant extent, on economic, political and social conditions in our main export markets. Our future ability to conduct business in our export markets could be adversely affected by factors beyond our control, such as the following: · exchange rate fluctuations; · deterioration in international economic conditions; · political risks, such as turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa, government policies in Argentina and political instability in Venezuela; · imposition of increased tariffs, anti-dumping duties or other trade barriers; · strikes or other events affecting ports and other transport facilities; · compliance with differing foreign legal and regulatory regimes; and · sabotage affecting our products. We recently entered into a 50-50 joint venture in China, and we may decide to enter into other joint ventures in the future. To the extent we operate internationally through joint ventures, we will be subject to the risks inherent in joint venture structures, including the risk of disagreements with our joint venture partners, limitations on our ability to manage our business independently under the terms of the applicable joint venture agreements and the risk of encountering difficulty in exiting from joint venture arrangements if we wish to do so. 17 Table Of Contents The market dynamics of our important export markets can change quickly and unpredictably due to these factors, the imposition of trade barriers of the type described above and other factors, which together can significantly affect our export volumes, selling prices and results of operations. Our export sales are highly dependent on conditions at a small number of ports in southern Brazil. We export our products primarily through ports in southern Brazil (Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul). We have been affected from time to time by strikes of port employees or customs agents, sanitary inspection agents and other government agents at the Brazilian ports from which we export our products. For example, in the third quarter of 2007 and in March 2008, Brazilian federal government sanitary inspectors went on strike for approximately one month. In August 2011, a strike at the Itajaí port affected exports for approximately two months. More recently, in the middle of 2012, a strike of Brazilian Sanitary Inspection Agency (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária, or Anvisa) and a nationwide strike of truckers also hampered our export operations. A widespread or protracted strike in the future could adversely affect our business and our results of operations. In 2012, we had new strikes from Anvisa and employees of federal fiscal government. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2008, flooding and damage at the ports of Itajaí and Navegantes damaged port infrastructure and required us to divert all our exports in the region of Santa Catarina to three other ports: Rio Grande in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Paranaguá and São Francisco. These events resulted in reduced shipment levels in November 2008 and led to delays in exports that adversely affected our export revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008. Any similar events in the future affecting the infrastructure necessary for the export of our products could adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations. Our plans to construct a new plant in the Middle East could adversely affect our strategy of international expansion and negatively impact our revenues. Two important components of our strategy involve strengthening our global distribution network and further developing our international customer base. In line with that strategy, in 2012 we began construction of a new plant in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East, the first time we have undertaken a construction project in the Middle East. In addition to being subject to the general risks of international operations described above under “—Our export sales are subject to a broad range of risks associated with international operations,” we are now subject to the specific risks associated with undertaking a major construction project in a region where our activities to date have been limited to sales, marketing and distribution. Our construction project could be cancelled or postponed due to delays in, or failure to obtain, approval or permitting for plant construction, or the production and distribution capacity we hope to achieve through the project could be limited, in each case for a variety of reasons, including (1) governmental inertia, (2) geopolitical risk, (3) potentially stringent localization requirements, (4) imposition of exchange or price controls, (5) impositions of restrictions on exports of our products or imports of raw materials necessary for our production and the construction of our plant, (6) fluctuation of local currencies against the real, (7) nationalization of our property, increase in export tax and income tax rates for our products, and (8) unilateral (governmental) institutional and contractual changes, including controls on investments and limitations on new projects. As a result of these factors, the results of operations and financial conditions of our operations in the Middle East may be adversely affected, and we may experience in the future significant variability in our revenue on both an annual and a quarterly basis from those operations. The impact of these changes on our ability to deliver on our planned projects and execute our strategy cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty, and these changes may, therefore, have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Political and economic risks in Argentina could limit the profitability of our operations and our ability to execute our strategy in that country. We have nine production facilities in Argentina, and we view growth of our business in Argentina as an important component of our strategy in South America. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we acquired two Argentine companies, Avex and Flora Dánica, demonstrating our commitment to expanding in Argentina. In June 2012, as part of our transaction with Marfrig, we acquired 90.05% of Quickfood, a leading Argentine processor and packager of meat, especially in the hamburger market with the brand Paty. We estimate that our integrated operations in the Argentine market represent over R$1 billion of sales per year. However, executing our strategy in Argentina is subject to significant political and economic risks. Political and economic conditions have been volatile in that country for more than a decade. An economic crisis in 2001-2002 resulted in significant economic contraction and political and social unrest, as well as a sovereign debt default and a significant currency devaluation and subsequent inflation. After a period of recovery and growth in the following years, Argentina suffered an economic decline in 2009, in part because of global conditions. Economic uncertainty, inflation and other factors could lead to lower real salaries, lower consumption and unemployment, which could have an adverse effect on demand for our products. In addition, Argentine government policies may adversely affect our ability to realize a return on our investment in Argentina. For example, the government has imposed restrictions on the conversion of Argentine currency into foreign currencies and on the remittance to foreign investors of proceeds of their investments in Argentina. In April 2012, the Argentine government’s effective nationalization of YPF S.A., Argentina’s leading energy company, led to a dramatic decline in the prices of Argentine securities and great concern among international investors. Argentine government intervention, investor reactions and economic uncertainty in Argentina could adversely affect the profitability of our operations and our ability to execute our strategy in that country. 18 Table Of Contents Environmental laws and regulations require increasing expenditures for compliance. We, like other Brazilian food producers, are subject to extensive Brazilian federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations, authorizations and licenses concerning, among other things, the handling and disposal of waste, discharges of pollutants into the air, water and soil, and clean-up of contamination, all of which affect our business. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any lack of authorizations or licenses could result in civil, administrative and criminal penalties, such as fines, cancellation of authorizations or revocation of licenses, in addition to negative publicity and liability for remediation or for environmental damage. We cannot operate a plant if the required environmental permit is not valid or current. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. Because of the possibility of unanticipated regulatory measures or other developments, particularly as environmental laws become more stringent in Brazil, the amount and timing of future expenditures required to maintain compliance could increase from current levels and could adversely affect the availability of funds for capital expenditures and other purposes. Compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations, as well as obligations in agreements with public entities, could result in increased costs and expenses. Our plants are subject to environmental licensing, based on their pollution potential and usage of natural resources. If, for example, one of our plants is built or expanded without an environmental license or if our environmental licenses expire, are not renewed or have their solicitation of renewal dismissed by the competent environmental authority, we may incur fines and other administrative penalties, suspension of operations or closing of the facilities in question. Those same penalties may also be applicable in the case of failure to fulfill the conditions of validity foreseen in the environmental licenses already held by us. Currently, some of our environmental licenses are being renewed, and we cannot guarantee that environmental agencies will approve our renewal requests within the required legal period. Acquisitions may divert management resources or prove to be disruptive to our company. We regularly review and pursue opportunities for strategic growth through acquisitions and other business ventures. We have completed several acquisitions in recent years, as described under “Item 4. Information on the Company—A. History and Development of the Company.” Acquisitions, especially involving sizeable enterprises, may present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulty with integrating personnel and financial and other systems, increased compensation expenses for newly hired employees, assumption of unknown liabilities and potential disputes with the sellers. We could also experience financial or other challenges if any of the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future give rise to liabilities or problems of which we are not aware. Acquisitions outside of Brazil may present additional difficulties, such as compliance with foreign legal and regulatory systems and integration of personnel to different managerial practices and would increase our exposure to risks associated with international operations. In recent years, the size of our acquisitions has increased, which has increased the magnitude of the challenges described above. In 2009, we completed our business combination with Sadia, which was approved by the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense (Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica, the Brazilian government agency with antitrust decision-making authority, or “CADE”) in 2011. Since the Sadia transaction, we have continued to grow through acquisitions, in line with our strategy to increase the internationalization of the company. In 2011, we acquired two Argentine companies, Avex, a poultry producer, and Flora Dánica, a margarine producer and distributor, for R$188.3 million, and we acquired the remaining one-third of Avex in December 2012. In September 2011, we announced that we had exercised an option to purchase the industrial unit of Coopercampos located in the city of Campos Novos in the State of Santa Catarina, and we have invested a total amount of R$154.5 million in this project. In November 2011, we also acquired a Brazilian company named Heloísa Indústria e Comércio de Produtos Lácteos Ltda. for cash consideration of R$55.0 million (and total consideration, including assumption of indebtedness, of R$122.5 million), as a part of our strategy to increase our operations in the dairy business. In June 2012, we acquired a 90.05% interest in Quickfood, an Argentine company, as part of our transaction with Marfrig. We also acquired a 49% stake in Federal Foods Limited, a company headquartered in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, in January 2013 for U.S.$37.1 million. We may not realize the benefits of the acquisitions we undertake, in the timeframe we anticipate or at all, because of integration or other challenges. 19 Table Of Contents We may not realize the expected benefits of our business combination with Sadia, whether because of lost revenues from businesses we were required to divest, difficulty in achieving projected synergies or other reasons. In July 2011, we received Brazilian antitrust approval for our business combination with Sadia from the CADE, but that approval was subject to a number of conditions set forth in the Performance Commitment Agreement (Termo de Compromisso de Desempenho, or “TCD”), including, among others, the suspension of use of certain brands for a range from three to five years and the divestment of certain trademarks, plants, and distribution centers in the domestic market. In March 2012, we entered into an agreement with Marfrig Alimentos S.A. (“Marfrig”), pursuant to which we agreed to transfer certain assets in compliance with the TCD. The initial closing of the transaction occurred in June 2012. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—A. History and Development of the Company—Business Combination with Sadia.” The divestment and suspension of these brands has required us to refocus our marketing and sales efforts on our remaining brands in the Brazilian market and adjust our operations accordingly. The assets divested to Marfrig and the suspension of other brands under the TCD decreased our sales volumes in the Brazilian domestic market by one-third in 2012 compared to 2011, and our strategy of increasing our marketing efforts using the Sadia brand in order to mitigate the impact of the loss of volume was one of the primary areas of focus of our management during 2012 and will remain an important focus and risk in 2013. Although we expect to achieve synergies from the integration of the Brazilian operations of BRF and Sadia, those synergies may not compensate for the lost revenue from the brands and assets divested to Marfrig or the suspended brands or any unanticipated costs. Our synergy projections are based on historical sales volumes, and if our sales volumes in future periods are lower than those we have assumed, our synergies could also be lower than our projections. In addition, we estimate that we will need to invest approximately R$700 million from 2011 to 2013 to achieve our projected synergies. We may not achieve the full amount of our projected synergies for 2013, or it may take us longer to achieve these synergies than we currently anticipate. Our integration of the Brazilian business of Sadia with our Brazilian business is ongoing, and any failure to effectively integrate those operations may increase our costs, adversely affect our margins or have other negative consequences. In addition to managing the impact on our sales volumes and business of the divestiture of assets to Marfrig and the suspension of other brands, we continue to face the challenge of continuing to integrate the BRF and Sadia customer distribution networks, the two largest such networks in Brazil and other aspects of the BRF and Sadia businesses. The business combination with Sadia was significantly larger than any other transaction we have undertaken in the past, and the Brazilian antitrust approval raised more complex issues than we have faced in any other acquisition. The ongoing integration of the BRF and Sadia businesses is occurring at the same time that we are managing the impact of the divestiture of assets to Marfrig and the suspension of other brands. Any failure to balance the unique combination of the challenges described above could adversely affect our results of operations and prospects and the market price of our common shares or ADRs. 20 Table Of Contents Unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may reduce our liquidity and negatively affect us. We are defendants in civil, labor and tax proceedings and are also subject to consent agreements (Termo de Ajustamento de Conduta). Under IFRS, we classify the risk of adverse results in these proceedings as “remote,” “possible” or “probable.” We disclose the aggregate amounts of these proceedings that we have judged possible or probable, to the extent the amounts are known or reasonably estimable, and we record provisions only for losses that we consider probable. These disclosures for 2012 are included in “Item 8. Financial Information—Legal Proceedings” and Note 25 to our consolidated financial statements. We are not required to disclose or record provisions for proceedings in which our management judges the risk of loss to be remote. However, the amounts involved in certain of the proceedings in which we believe our risk of loss is remote are substantial, and the losses to us could be significantly higher than the amounts for which we have recorded provisions. Even for the amounts recorded as provisions for probable losses, a judgment against us would have an effect on our cash flow if we were required to pay those amounts. Unfavorable decisions in our legal proceedings may, therefore, reduce our liquidity and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will obtain favorable decisions in these proceedings or that our reserves will be sufficient to cover potential liabilities resulting from unfavorable decisions. In the ordinary course of business, we outsource labor to third parties. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Production Process.” If it were to become necessary to revisit this contractual structure, we could incur additional operating expenses. Our tax liabilities have increased due to more intense auditing and enforcement efforts by Brazilian tax authorities with respect to Brazilian companies. In 2012, we observed a more intense focus by the Brazilian federal tax authorities in issuing tax infraction notices and more aggressive enforcement efforts, including in instances where they might not have done so in the past. In particular, the number and amount of tax infraction notices relating to our use of tax credits under the federal Social Integration Program (Programa de Integração Social), or “PIS,” the federal Contribution for Social Security Financing (Contribuição para Financiamento da Seguridade Social — COFINS), or “COFINS,” to offset other federal tax liabilities increased significantly, causing our estimate of possible losses relating to those matters to increase from R$582.9 million at the end of 2011 to $1,386.0 million at the end of 2012. These matters were a primary reason our estimate of consolidated tax contingencies classified as possible losses increased from R$5,295.0 million at the end of 2011 to R$6,582.1 million at the end of 2012. The bulk of the tax infraction notices to date relating to PIS and COFINS tax credits correspond to tax years through 2007. Although we intend to vigorously defend against these tax infraction notices and related administrative proceedings, we expect that the number of cases and the aggregate amount of possible losses will continue to increase as the tax authorities address later tax years. We have also observed an increase in the speed of the issuance of notices and the initiation of administrative proceedings by the Brazilian federal tax authorities in recent years due to increased automation of Brazilian tax systems. The greater use of electronic filing and payment has increased the ability of the Brazilian federal tax authorities to analyze tax payment data and accelerate the initiation of proceedings against Brazilian companies. We believe this increased automation is one reason for the increase in tax infraction notices described above. If this increased automation leads to acceleration of the resolution of disputed tax amounts, we could be required to pay disputed amounts earlier than in the past, which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. We depend on members of our senior management and on our ability to recruit and retain qualified professionals to implement our strategy. We depend on members of our senior management and other qualified professionals to implement our business strategies. Efforts to recruit and retain professionals may result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect us. In addition, the loss of key professionals may adversely affect our ability to implement our strategy. 21 Table Of Contents Damages not covered by our insurance might result in losses for us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. As is typical in our business, our plants, distribution centers, vehicles and our directors and officers, among others, are insured. However, certain kinds of losses cannot be insured against, and our insurance policies are subject to liability limits and exclusions. If an event that cannot be insured occurs, or the damages are higher than our policy limits, we may incur significant costs. In addition, we could be required to pay indemnification to parties affected by such an event. In addition, even where we incur losses that are ultimately covered by insurance, we may incur additional expenses to mitigate the loss, such as shifting production to another facility. These costs may not be fully covered by our insurance. For example, in March 2011, a fire affected a part of the installations of our Nova Mutum, Mato Grosso unit, and on October 2011, another fire affected a part of the installations of our Brasília unit. Although the facilities are covered by fire insurance and the units’ production was temporarily absorbed by other BRF plants, we cannot assure you that all of our direct and indirect costs will be covered by our insurance. Any similar event at other facilities in the future could adversely affect our revenues, expenses and our business. Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness We have substantial indebtedness, especially since our business combination with Sadia, and our leverage could negatively affect our ability to refinance our indebtedness and grow our business. At December 31, 2012, our total liabilities with respect to indebtedness and derivative instruments was R$9,771.7 million. Our substantial indebtedness could have major consequences for us, including: · requiring that a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the funds available for our operations or other capital needs; · limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate because our available cash flow after paying principal and interest on our debt might not be sufficient to make the capital and other expenditures necessary to address these changes; · increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions because, during periods in which we experience lower earnings and cash flows, we would be required to devote a proportionally greater amount of our cash flows to paying principal and interest on debt; · limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate requirements; · making it difficult for us to refinance our indebtedness or to refinance such indebtedness on terms favorable to us, including with respect to existing accounts receivable securitizations; · placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that are relatively less leveraged and that may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns; and · exposing our current and future borrowings made at floating interest rates to increases in interest rates. We have substantial debt that matures in each of the next several years. As of December 31, 2012, we had R$2,440.8 million of debt that matures in 2013, R$1,004.4 million of debt that matures in 2014, R$734.6 million of debt that matures in 2015, R$425.0 million of debt that matures in 2016 and R$4,913.5 million of debt that matures in 2017 and thereafter. 22 Table Of Contents A substantial portion of our outstanding debt is denominated in foreign currencies, primarily U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2012, we had R$5,628.5 million of foreign currency debt, including R$761.2 million of short-term foreign currency debt. Our U.S. dollar-denominated debt must be serviced by funds generated from sales by our subsidiaries, the majority of which are not denominated in U.S. dollars. Consequently, when we do not generate sufficient U.S. dollar revenues to cover that debt service, we must use revenues generated in reais or other currencies to service our U.S. dollar-denominated debt. Depreciation in the value of the real or any of the other currencies of the countries in which we operate, compared to the U.S. dollar, could adversely affect our ability to service our debt. Foreign currency hedge agreements may not be effective in covering these currency-related risks. Any future uncertainty in the stock and credit markets could negatively impact our ability to access additional short-term and long-term financing, which could negatively impact our liquidity and financial condition. If, in future years: · the pressures on credit return as a result of disruptions in the global stock and credit markets, · our operating results worsen significantly, · we are unable to complete any necessary divestitures of non-core assets and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, or · we are unable to refinance any of our debt that becomes due, we could face liquidity problems and may not be able to pay our outstanding debt when due, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated business and financial condition. The terms of our indebtedness impose significant restrictions on us. The instruments governing our consolidated indebtedness impose significant restrictions on us. These restrictions may limit, directly or indirectly, our ability, among other things, to undertake the following actions: · borrow money; · make investments; · sell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; · guarantee indebtedness; · enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other distributions from certain subsidiaries; · enter into transactions with affiliates; · create or assume liens; and · engage in mergers or consolidations. Although the covenants to which we are subject have exceptions and qualifications, the breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the terms of other existing debt obligations. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, all amounts outstanding under the applicable debt instruments and the debt issued under other debt instruments containing cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, might become or be declared immediately due and payable. If such indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may have insufficient funds to repay in full any such indebtedness. In addition, in connection with the entry into new financings or amendments to existing financing arrangements, our subsidiaries’ financial and operational flexibility may be further reduced as a result of the imposition of covenants that are more restrictive, the requirements for additional security, and other terms. 23 Table Of Contents Risks Relating to Brazil Brazilian economic, political and other conditions, and Brazilian government policies or actions in response to these conditions, may negatively affect our business and results of operations. The Brazilian economy has historically been characterized by interventions by the Brazilian government and unstable economic cycles. The Brazilian government has often changed monetary, taxation, credit, tariff and other policies to influence the course of Brazil’s economy. For example, the government’s actions to control inflation have at times involved setting wage and price controls, blocking access to bank accounts, imposing exchange controls and limiting imports into Brazil. We have no control over, and cannot predict, what policies or actions the Brazilian government may take in the future. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects as well as the market prices of our common shares or the ADRs may be adversely affected by, among others, the following factors: · exchange rate movements; · exchange control policies; · expansion or contraction of the Brazilian economy, as measured by rates of growth in GDP; · inflation; · tax policies; · other economic political, diplomatic and social developments in or affecting Brazil; · interest rates; · energy shortages; · liquidity of domestic capital and lending markets; · changes in environmental regulation; and · social and political instability. These factors, as well as uncertainty over whether the Brazilian government may implement changes in policy or regulations relating to these factors, may adversely affect us and our business and financial performance and the market prices of our common shares or the ADRs. Inflation, and government measures to curb inflation, may adversely affect the Brazilian economy, the Brazilian securities market, our business and operations, financial condition, and the market prices of our common shares or the ADRs. Brazil experienced high rates of inflation in the past. According to the General Market Price Index (Índice Geral de Preços do Mercado), or “IGP-M,” a general price inflation index, the inflation rates in Brazil were 7.7% in 2007, 9.8% in 2008, 1.7% in 2009, 11.3% in 2010, 5.1% in 2011 and 7.82% in 2012. In addition, according to the IPCA, published by the IBGE, Brazilian consumer price inflation rates were 5.9% in 2010, 6.5% in 2011 and 5.8% in 2012. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, the actual inflation rate was significantly higher than the Brazilian Central Bank’s target of 4.5%. Increases in personal expenses (which include services) and food/beverage prices were the main reason that consumer inflation did not meet the Central Bank’s target in 2012. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—A. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Brazilian and Global Economic Conditions” and “—Effects of Exchange Rate Variations and Inflation.” 24 Table Of Contents The Brazilian government’s measures to control inflation have often included maintaining a tight monetary policy with high interest rates, thereby restricting availability of credit and reducing economic growth. Inflation, actions to combat inflation and public speculation about possible additional actions have also contributed materially to economic uncertainty in Brazil in the past and to heightened volatility in the Brazilian securities markets. Brazil may experience continuing higher levels of inflation in future periods. Periods of higher inflation may slow the rate of growth of the Brazilian economy, which could lead to reduced demand for our products in Brazil and decreased net sales. Inflation also is likely to increase some of our costs and expenses, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers and, as a result, may reduce our profit margins and net income. In addition, high inflation generally leads to higher domestic interest rates, and, as a result, the costs of servicing our debt may increase, resulting in lower net income. In addition, inflation and its effect on domestic interest rates can lead to reduced liquidity in the domestic capital and lending markets, which could affect our ability to refinance our indebtedness in those markets and may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and the market price of our common shares and the ADRs. Exchange rate movements may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, there have been significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Brazilian currency and the U.S. dollar and other currencies. In 2008, the real depreciated 31.9% against the U.S. dollar. In 2009 and 2010, the real appreciated 25.5% and 4.3%, respectively, against the U.S. dollar. In 2011, the real depreciated 12.6% against the U.S. dollar. In 2012, the real depreciated 8.9% against the U.S. dollar. Any appreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar may lead to a dampening of export-driven growth. Our production costs are denominated in reais, but our export sales are mostly denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. Financial revenues generated by exports are reduced when translated to reais in the periods in which the real appreciates in relation to the U.S. dollar. Any such appreciation could reduce the competitiveness of our exports and adversely affect our net sales and our cash flows from exports. On the other hand, any depreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar could create additional inflationary pressures in Brazil by increasing the price of imported products and requiring deflationary government policies. In addition, the prices of soy meal and soybeans, important ingredients of our animal feedstock, are closely linked to the U.S. dollar, and many of the mineral nutrients added to our feedstock must be purchased in U.S. dollars. The price of corn, another important ingredient of our feedstock, is also linked to the U.S. dollar to a lesser degree. In addition to feedstock ingredients, we purchase sausage casings, breeder eggs, packaging and other raw materials, as well as equipment for use in our production facilities, from suppliers located outside Brazil whom we must pay in U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies. When the real depreciates against the U.S. dollar, the cost in reais of our U.S. dollar-linked raw materials and equipment increases, and these increases could materially adversely affect our results of operations. We had total foreign currency-denominated debt obligations in an aggregate amount of R$5,628.5 million at December 31, 2012, representing approximately 57.6% of our total consolidated indebtedness at that date. A significant portion of our consolidated debt is denominated in foreign currencies because export credit facilities available in foreign currencies often have attractive financing conditions and costs compared to other financing sources. Foreign-currency denominated credit facilities expose us to a greater degree of foreign exchange risk. We manage a portion of our exchange rate risk through foreign currency swaps and investments and through cash flows from export sales are in U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies, but our foreign currency debt obligations are not completely hedged. At December 31, 2012, our short-term consolidated exchange rate exposure was R$761.2 million of the amount described above. A significant devaluation of the real in relation to the U.S. dollar or other currencies could increase the debt service requirements of our foreign currency-denominated obligations. 25 Table Of Contents Fluctuations in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and the market prices of our common shares or the ADRs. The Central Bank establishes the basic interest rate target for the Brazilian financial system by reference to the level of economic growth of the Brazilian economy, the level of inflation and other economic indicators. At the end of former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s administration, interest rates were lowered to stimulate economic growth. From 2008 to 2010, interest rates decreased from 13.75% to 10.75% and inflation was kept under 5.0%. With the transition to President Dilma Rousseff’s administration in January 2011, the Brazilian government has set a goal of cutting public expenditures and stabilizing the economy. The low interest rates from previous years resulted in high inflation rates of 6.5% in 2011 and 5.8% in 2012, leading to the Central Bank’s decision to increase interest rates to stabilize the economy. At December 31, 2012, approximately 27.3% of our total liabilities with respect to indebtedness and derivative instruments of R$9,771.7 million was either (1) denominated in (or swapped into) reais and bears interest based on Brazilian floating interest rates, such as the Long-Term Interest Rate (Taxa de Juros de Longo Prazo), or “TJLP,” the interest rate used in our financing agreements with Brazilian National Bank for Economic and Social Development (Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social — BNDES), or “BNDES,” and the Interbank Deposit Certificate Rate (Certificado de Depósito Interbancário), or “CDI” rate, an interbank certificate of deposit rate that applies to our foreign currency swaps and some of our other real-denominated indebtedness, or (2) U.S. dollar-denominated and bears interest based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or “LIBOR.” Any increase in the CDI, TJLP or LIBOR rates may have an adverse impact on our financial expenses and our results of operations. Changes in tax laws may increase our tax burden and, as a result, negatively affect our profitability. The Brazilian government regularly implements changes to tax regimes that may increase our and our customers’ tax burdens. These changes include modifications in the rate of assessments and, on occasion, enactment of temporary taxes, the proceeds of which are earmarked for designated governmental purposes. In the past, the Brazilian government has presented certain tax reform proposals, which have been mainly designed to simplify the Brazilian tax system, to avoid internal disputes within and between the Brazilian states and municipalities, and to redistribute tax revenues. The tax reform proposals provide for changes in the rules governing the federal PIS and COFINS taxes, the state Tax on the Circulation of Merchandise and Services (Imposto Sobre a Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços), or “ICMS,” and some other taxes. These proposals may not be approved and passed into law. The effects of these proposed tax reform measures and any other changes that result from enactment of additional tax reforms have not been, and cannot be, quantified. However, some of these measures, if enacted, may result in increases in our overall tax burden, which could negatively affect our overall financial performance. In addition, in 2012, a provisional tax measure was enacted that reduces PIS and COFINS taxes levied on a market basket of basic goods, including margarine and butter. When we acquire inputs and raw materials, we register tax credits. When we sell the final products, including margarine and butter, we accrue tax debts. When the goods are sold, the tax credits on inputs and raw materials previously acquired are used to offset the tax debts levied on the final products. To the extent that certain products will no longer be subject to taxes, we will not be able to monetize tax credits to the same extent as we did in the past. We support the Brazilian government initiative to reduce taxes and to reduce the complexity of the Brazilian tax system, especially when it relates to the basic goods. However, we believe that the inability to monetize the tax credits described above may have an adverse effect on us, which we are currently evaluating. We are currently discussing with the Brazilian government alternatives to mitigate the potential adverse impact associated with the provisional measure. Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and the ADRs Holders of ADRs may find it difficult to exercise voting rights at our shareholders’ meetings. Holders of ADRs may exercise voting rights with respect to our common shares represented by ADSs and evidenced by ARSs only in accordance with the deposit agreement governing the ADRs. Holders of ADRs face practical limitations in exercising their voting rights because of the additional steps involved in our communications with ADRs holders. For example, we are required to publish a notice of our shareholders’ meetings in specified newspapers in Brazil. Holders of our common shares are able to exercise their voting rights by attending a shareholders’ meeting in person or voting by proxy. By contrast, holders of ADRs will receive notice of a shareholders’ meeting by mail from the ADR depositary if we give notice to the depositary requesting the depository to do so. To exercise their voting rights, holders of ADRs must instruct the ADR depositary on a timely basis. This voting process necessarily takes longer for holders of ADRs than for holders of our common shares. If the ADR depositary fails to receive timely voting instructions for all or part of the ADRs, the depositary will assume that the holders of those ADRs are instructing it to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by us to vote their ADRs, to the extent permitted by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. 26 Table Of Contents Holders of ADRs also may not receive the voting materials in time to instruct the depositary to vote our common shares underlying the ADSs that are evidenced by their ADRs. In addition, the depositary and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions of the holders of ADRs or for the manner of carrying out those voting instructions. Accordingly, holders of ADRs may not be able to exercise voting rights, and they have little, if any, recourse if the common shares underlying the ADSs that are evidenced by their ADRs are not voted as requested. Non-Brazilian holders of ADRs and common shares may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are subject to different corporate rules and regulations as a Brazilian company, and our shareholders may have less extensive rights. Holders of ADRs are not direct shareholders of our company and are unable to enforce the rights of shareholders under our bylaws and the Brazilian Corporation Law. Our corporate affairs are governed by our bylaws and the Brazilian Corporation Law, which differ from the legal principles that would apply if we were incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States, such as the State of Delaware or New York, or elsewhere outside Brazil. Even if a holder of ADRs surrenders its ADRs and becomes a direct shareholder, its rights as a holder of our common shares under the Brazilian Corporation Law to protect its interests relative to actions by our board of directors or executive officers may be fewer and less well-defined than under the laws of those other jurisdictions. Although insider trading and price manipulation are crimes under Brazilian law, the Brazilian securities markets are subject to different levels of regulations and supervision than the U.S. securities markets or the markets in some other jurisdictions. In addition, rules and policies against self-dealing or for preserving shareholder interests may be less well defined and enforced in Brazil than in the United States and certain other countries, which may put holders of our common shares and the ADRs at a potential disadvantage. Corporate disclosures also may be less complete or informative than for a public company in the United States or in certain other countries. Non-Brazilian holders of ADRs and common shares may face difficulties in serving process on or enforcing judgments against us and other persons. We are a corporation (sociedade anônima) organized under the laws of Brazil, and all of our directors and executive officers and our independent public accountants reside or are based in Brazil. Most of the assets of our company and of these other persons are located in Brazil. As a result, it may not be possible for non-Brazilian holders of ADRs and common shares to effect service of process upon us or these other persons within the United States or other jurisdictions outside Brazil or to enforce against us or these other persons judgments obtained in the United States or other jurisdictions outside Brazil. Because judgments of U.S. courts for civil liabilities based upon the U.S. federal securities laws may only be enforced in Brazil if certain conditions are met, holders may face greater difficulties in protecting their interests in the case of actions by us or our directors or executive officers than would shareholders of a U.S. corporation. Judgments of Brazilian courts with respect to our common shares may be payable only in reais. If proceedings are brought in the courts of Brazil seeking to enforce our obligations in respect of the common shares, we may not be required to discharge our obligations in a currency other than reais. Under Brazilian exchange control limitations, an obligation in Brazil to pay amounts denominated in a currency other than reais may only be satisfied in Brazilian currency at the exchange rate, as determined by the Central Bank, in effect on the date the judgment is obtained, and such amounts are then adjusted to reflect exchange rate variations through the effective payment date. The then prevailing exchange may not afford non-Brazilian investors with full compensation for any claim arising out of or related to our obligations under the common shares or the ADRs. 27 Table Of Contents Holders of ADRs and non-Brazilian holders of our common shares may be unable to exercise preemptive rights and tag-along rights with respect to our common shares underlying the ADSs evidenced by their ADRs. Holders of ADRs and non-Brazilian holders of our common shares may be unable to exercise the preemptive rights and tag-along rights relating to our common shares (including common shares underlying the ADSs evidenced by their ADRs) unless a registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the “Securities Act,” is effective with respect to those rights or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available. We are not obligated to file a registration statement with respect to the shares relating to these preemptive rights, and we cannot assure you that we will file any such registration statement. Unless we file a registration statement or an exemption from registration is available, a holder may receive only the net proceeds from the sale of his or her preemptive rights or tag-along rights, or if these rights cannot be sold, they will lapse and the holder will receive no value from them. Provisions in our bylaws may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our control or management. Our bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or make more difficult a change in control of our company or removal of our directors. Subject to limited exceptions, these provisions require any shareholder that acquires shares representing 20.0% or more of our share capital to, within 30 days from the date of such acquisition, commence a tender offer with respect to all of our share capital for a price per share equivalent to the greatest of: (1) the economic value of our company, which shall be equivalent to the arithmetic average of the mean points of the economic value ranges obtained in two appraisal reports prepared based on the discounted cash flow method, as long as the variation between these mean points shall not exceed 10.0%, in which case the economic value shall be determined through arbitration; (2) 135.0% of the issue price of the shares issued in any capital increase through a public offering that takes place within the 24-month period before the date on which the public offering shall become mandatory, duly adjusted in accordance with the IPCA variation up to the date of payment; and (3) 135.0% of the unit price of our shares within the 30-day period before the public offering. These provisions of our bylaws may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders. Holders of ADRs could be subject to Brazilian income tax on capital gains from sales of ADRs. Historically, any capital gain realized on a sale or other disposition of ADRs between non-Brazilian holders outside Brazil was not subject to Brazilian income tax. However, a December 2003 Brazilian law (Law No. 10,833, of December 29, 2003) provides that “the acquirer, individual or legal entity resident or domiciled in Brazil, or the acquirer’s attorney-in-fact, when such acquirer is resident or domiciled abroad, shall be responsible for the retention and payment of the income tax applicable to capital gains earned by the individual or legal entity resident or domiciled abroad who disposes of property located in Brazil.” The Brazilian tax authorities have issued a normative instruction confirming that they intend to assess income tax on capital gains earned by non-Brazilian residents whose assets are located in Brazil. It is unclear whether ADSs representing our common shares and evidenced by ADRs, which are issued by the ADR depositary outside Brazil, will be deemed to be “property located in Brazil” for purposes of this law. Accordingly, we cannot determine whether Brazilian tax authorities will attempt to tax any capital gains arising from the sale or other disposition of the ADRs, even when the transaction is consummated outside Brazil between non-Brazilian residents. Brazilian taxes may apply to a gain realized by a non-Brazilian holder on the disposition of common shares to another non-Brazilian holder. The gain realized by a non-Brazilian holder on the disposition of common shares to another non-Brazilian holder (other than a disposition of shares held pursuant to Resolution No. 2,689, as amended, of the Brazilian National Monetary Council (Conselho Monetário Nacional), or “CMN,” is generally viewed as being subject to taxation in Brazil. Pursuant to Article 26 of Law No. 10,833/03, Brazilian tax authorities may assess income tax on capital gains earned by non-Brazilian residents in transactions involving assets that are located in Brazil. In this case, the tax rate applicable on the gain would be 15.0% (or 25.0% in the case of a non-Brazilian holder organized under the laws of or a resident of a tax haven). For additional discussion of the tax consequences of a disposition of our common shares, see “Item 10. Additional Information––Taxation.” 28 Table Of Contents The relative volatility and limited liquidity of the Brazilian securities markets may negatively affect the liquidity and market prices of our common shares and the ADRs. The Brazilian securities markets are substantially smaller, less liquid and more volatile than major securities markets in the United States. The Brazilian Securities, Commodities and Futures Exchange, BM&FBOVESPA S.A. – Bolsa de Valores Mercadorias e Futuros (the “BM&FBOVESPA” or the “São Paulo Stock Exchange”) had a total traded volume of R$1,784 billion, or U.S.$917 billion, at December 31, 2012 and an average daily trading volume of R$7.2 billion in 2012. By contrast, the New York Stock Exchange had a market traded volume of U.S.$26.2 trillion at December 31, 2012 (U.S. domestic listed companies) and an average daily trading volume of U.S.$104 billion in 2012. The Brazilian securities markets are also characterized by considerable share concentration. The ten largest companies in terms of market capitalization represented approximately 54.0% of the aggregate market capitalization of the São Paulo Stock Exchange at December 31, 2012. In addition, the ten most widely traded stocks in terms of trading volume accounted for approximately 47.0% of all shares traded on the São Paulo Stock Exchange in 2011. These market characteristics may substantially limit the ability of holders of the ADRs to sell common shares underlying ADSs evidenced by ADRs at a price and at a time when they wish to do so and, as a result, could negatively impact the market prices of these securities. Developments and the perception of risks in other countries, especially emerging market countries, may adversely affect the market prices of our common shares and the ADRs. The market for securities issued by Brazilian companies is influenced, to varying degrees, by economic and market conditions in other emerging market countries. Although economic conditions are different in each country, the reaction of investors to developments in one country may cause the capital markets in other countries to fluctuate. Developments or adverse economic conditions in other emerging market countries have at times resulted in significant outflows of funds from, and declines in the amount of foreign currency invested in, Brazil. For example, in 2001, after a prolonged recession, followed by political instability, Argentina announced that it would no longer continue to service its public debt. The economic crisis in Argentina negatively affected, for several years, investors’ perceptions of Brazilian securities. Economic or political crises in Latin America or other emerging markets may significantly affect perceptions of the risk inherent in investing in the region, including Brazil. The Brazilian economy also is affected by international economic and market conditions generally, especially economic and market conditions in the United States. Share prices on the São Paulo Stock Exchange, for example, have historically been sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates as well as movements of the major U.S. stock indexes. Developments in other countries and securities markets could adversely affect the market prices of our common shares or the ADRs and could also make it more difficult for us to access the capital markets and finance our operations in the future on acceptable terms or at all. We may become a passive foreign investment company, which could result in adverse U.S. tax consequences to U.S. investors. Based on our financial statements, relevant market and shareholder data, and the projected composition of our income and valuation of our assets, including goodwill, we do not believe that we were a passive foreign investment company, or “PFIC,” for U.S. federal income tax purposes for 2012, and we do not expect to be a PFIC for 2013 or in the future, although we can provide no assurances in this regard. If we become a PFIC, U.S. holders of our common shares or ADRs may become subject to increased tax liabilities under U.S. tax laws and regulations and will become subject to burdensome reporting requirements. The determination of whether or not we are a PFIC is made on an annual basis and will depend on the composition of our income and assets from time to time. Specifically, for any taxable year we will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. tax purposes if either (i) 75.0% or more of our gross income in that taxable year is passive income or (ii) the average percentage of our assets (which includes cash) by value in that taxable year which produce or are held for the production of passive income is at least 50.0%. The calculation of the value of our assets will be based, in part, on the quarterly market value of our common shares and ADRs, which is subject to change. See “Item 10. Additional Information––E. Taxation––U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations––Passive Foreign Investment Company.” 29 Table Of Contents
