D. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition Indentures relating to our notes and our controlling shareholder Sistema's notes contain, and some of our loan agreements and Sistema's loan agreements contain, restrictive covenants, which limit our ability to incur debt and to engage in various activities." A summary of our cash flows and cash outlays for capital expenditures and acquisitions of subsidiaries follows: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 (in thousands) Cash flows: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,799,436 $ 2,378,916 $ 3,350,156 Net cash used in investing activities (2,454,173 ) (1,779,562 ) (2,343,881 ) Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities 461,528 (464,066 ) (692,894 ) Net (decrease)/increase in cash $ (195,866 ) $ 141,705 $ 414,509 Cash outlays for: Capital expenditures(1) $ (2,181,347 ) $ (1,721,968 ) $ (1,539,528 ) Acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired $ (178,917 ) $ (38,188 ) $ (873,071 ) (1)Includes acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. For the year ended December 31, 2007, net cash provided by operating activities was $3,350.2 million, an increase of 40.8% from the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to a growth in total revenues and operating income due to an increase in our subscriber base. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a positive free cash flow of $964.4 million, which is calculated by us as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, investments and acquisition of subsidiaries. Net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2007 was $2,343.9 million, an increase of 31.7% from the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase is mainly the result of an increase in cash spent on the acquisition of subsidiaries, from $38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $873.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Cash spent on the acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 to $1,539.5 million from $1,722.0 million due to broader expansion of our operations and consequent network construction in the prior period. Net cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2007 was $692.9 million, compared to $464.1 million used in the year ended December 31, 2006. The main reason for the increase in cash used in financing activities is that we paid dividends in the total amount of $756.9 million in 2007 as compared to $558.8 million paid in 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by operating activities was $2,378.9 million, an increase of 32.2% from the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to a growth in total revenues and operating income due to an increase in our subscriber base. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a positive free cash flow of $645.9 million for the first time in the last three years, which is calculated by us as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, investments and acquisition of subsidiaries. 102 Net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2006 was $1,779.6 million, a decrease of 27.5% from the year ended December 31, 2005. This decrease is mainly the result of a decrease in cash spent on the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets from $2,181.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $1,722.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 due to our policy of optimizing capital expenditures with greater emphasis on capacity over coverage spending in Russia and improving network quality. Net cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2006 was $464.1 million, compared to $461.5 million provided in the year ended December 31, 2005. In 2006, we paid dividends in the total amount of $558.8 million, which also included dividends paid to minority shareholders of certain of our subsidiaries. In addition, we paid $109.9 million for the repurchase of ADSs pursuant to a previously established share repurchase program. The primary reason for the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was due to the repayment of existing debt, which was partly offset by net proceeds from new bank loans. Liquidity As of December 31, 2007, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $634.5 million ($133.0 million in rubles, $270.4 million in U.S. dollars, $10.5 million in Ukrainian hryvnias, $167.5 million in Uzbek soms, $22.1 million in Turkmenistan manat, $23.3 in Armenian dramas and $7.7 in other currencies). In addition, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had short-term investments of $15.8 million and $56.0 million, respectively, mostly in U.S. dollar-denominated instruments at the Moscow Bank of Reconstruction and Development (MBRD), a related party. As of December 31, 2007, we had $11.2 million available under an outstanding credit facility. For a description of our outstanding external financing, see Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2007, we had a working capital deficit of $664.8 million compared to a deficit of $91.2 million as of December 31, 2006. The increase in working capital deficit was mainly attributable to a $562.7 million increase in the current portion of our debt, which includes $400.0 million of notes payable, and also an increase in trade payables and other current liabilities. As of December 31, 2006, we had a working capital deficit of $91.2 million compared to a deficit of $637.8 million as of December 31, 2005. The increase in working capital was attributable to a $618.6 million decrease in the current portion of our debt as a result of debt refinancing, which was partly offset by an accrual of a $170.0 million for Bitel's expired put option. An increase in current trade payables and accruals in the amount of $169.9 million was offset by increased prepaid expenses and inventories as of December 31, 2006. We expect to repay all long-term debts as they become due from our operating cash flows or through re-financings. We believe that our working capital together with our plans for external financing will provide us with sufficient funds for our present and future requirements. As most of our operating subsidiaries are incorporated in Russia, their ability to pay dividends to us is limited by provisions of Russian law. For example, Russian law requires that, among other things, dividends can only be paid in an amount not exceeding net profits as determined under Russian accounting standards, denominated in rubles, after certain deductions. In addition, dividends may only be paid if the value of the company's net assets is not less than the sum of the company's charter capital, the company's reserve fund and the difference between the liquidation value and the par value of the issued and outstanding preferred stock of the company, if any, as determined under Russian accounting standards. Our net income under Russian accounting standards (unaudited) for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007 that was distributable under Russian legislation amounted to $444.4 million, $1,181.0 million and $1,447.6 million, respectively. 103 Inflation The Russian economy has been characterized by high rates of inflation: Year Inflation rate 2003 12.0 % 2004 11.7 % 2005 10.9 % 2006 9.0 % 2007 11.9 % The Ukrainian economy has been characterized by varying rates of inflation: Year Inflation rate 2003 8.2 % 2004 12.3 % 2005 10.3 % 2006 9.1 % 2007 12.8 % Prior to June 20, 2006, we denominated our tariffs in units linked to the U.S. dollar in most of the regions in which we operate, except for Ukraine, Turkmenistan and Krasnodar region (South macro-region). Commencing June 20, 2006, we began charging our subscribers in rubles by linking the ruble amount we charged to a fixed U.S. dollar exchange rate. In April 2007, an amendment to the Federal Law on the Protection of Consumer Rights was enacted prohibiting companies from establishing prices in currencies other than rubles. In view of this amendment, as well as the growth in the share of our ruble-denominated expenditures, we began pricing our services and invoicing customers in Russia in rubles from January 1, 2007. We expect inflation-driven increases in costs to put pressure on our margins. While we could seek to raise our tariffs to compensate for such increase in costs, competitive pressures may not permit increases that are sufficient to preserve operating margins. For a detailed discussion of change in translation methodology, refer to Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements. Credit Rating Discussion Our credit ratings impact our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, and the cost of such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of factors, including our operating cash flows, total debt outstanding, commitments, interest requirements, liquidity needs and availability of liquidity. Other factors considered may include our business strategy, the condition of our industry and our position within the industry. Although we understand that these and other factors are among those considered by the rating agencies, each agency might calculate and weigh each factor differently. Our credit ratings as of the date of this document are as follows: Rating Agency Long-Term Debt Rating Outlook/Watch Moody's(1) Ba2 Positive Standard & Poor's(2) BB- Positive Fitch(3) BB+ Stable (1)Rated on October 9, 2007. (2)Rated on February 1, 2007. (3)Rated on April 7, 2008. 104 None of our existing indebtedness has any triggers related to our credit ratings. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those policies that require the application of management's most challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimated are those discussed below. Management estimates The preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our significant estimates include the recoverability of intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Useful Lives of Property Plant and Equipment We calculate depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We establish useful lives for each category of property, plant and equipment based on our assessment of the use of the assets and anticipated technology evolution. We review and revise if appropriate the assumptions used in the determination of useful lives of property, plant and equipment at least on an annual basis. With regard to certain equipment, we cannot predict with certainty the how and when developing technology will require us to replace such equipment. Impairment of Long-lived Assets We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets may not be recoverable, we compare undiscounted net cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets to the carrying amount of those assets. When these undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts of the assets, we record impairment losses to write the asset down to fair value, measured by the estimated discounted net future cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the assets. Impairment of long-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2007 amounted to $10.0 million. No impairment occurred during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 as impairment indicators were not present during these years. See also Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Assets Held for Sale We account for our existing assets held for sale in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" and report the assets at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. If the initial plan for sale of assets is reconsidered, we determine the fair value of assets held for sale using the discounted cash flow based on the expected timing of the sale. As a result of such reconsideration, the impairment loss on assets held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2007 were recognized in the amount of $6.8 million. See also Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements. 105 Impairment of Goodwill Goodwill represents an excess of the cost of a business acquired over the fair market value of identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever it is determined that one or more impairment indicators exist. We determine whether impairment has occurred by assigning goodwill to the reporting unit identified in accordance with SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit to the fair value of the reporting unit. If an impairment of goodwill has occurred, we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of goodwill. To date, no impairment of goodwill has occurred. Taxation Generally, tax declarations remain open and subject to inspection for a period of three years following the tax year. While most of our tax declarations have been inspected without significant penalties, these inspections do not eliminate the possibility of re-inspection. We believe that we have adequately provided for tax liabilities in our financial statements; however, the risk remains that relevant authorities could take differing positions with regard to interpretive issues and the effect could be significant. See Note 23 to our audited consolidated financial statements. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of existing differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, and for the loss or tax credit carry-forwards using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect at the time these differences are realized. We record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when it is likely that these assets will not be realized. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair value measurements" ("SFAS No. 157"). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure requirements of fair value measurement. SFAS No. 157 is applicable to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement, and accordingly, does not require any fair value measurement. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted SFAS No. 157 as of January 1, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities"including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" ("SFAS No.159"), which permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 159 offers an irrevocable option to carry the vast majority of financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings (the fair value option, or FVO). The Statement's objective is to improve financial reporting by allowing entities to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by the measurement of related assets and liabilities using different attributes, without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS No.159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141R, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141R"), and FAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of ARB No. 51" ("SFAS No. 160"). These statements substantially elevate the role played by fair value and dramatically change the way companies account for business combinations and noncontrolling 106 interests (minority interests in current GAAP). SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No.160 will require among other changes: (a) more assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date; (b) liabilities related to contingent consideration to be re-measured at fair value in each subsequent reporting period; (c) an acquirer to expense acquisition-related costs; and (d) noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries initially to be measured at fair value and classified as a separate component of equity. Both Statements are to be applied prospectively (with one exception related to income taxes) for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. However, SFAS No.160 requires entities to apply the presentation and disclosure requirements retrospectively (e.g., by reclassifying noncontrolling interests to appear in equity) to comparative financial statements, if presented. Both standards prohibit early adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160 may have on our financial position and results of operations. In connection with the issuance of SFAS No. 160, the SEC revised EITF Topic D-98 "Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities" ("Topic D-98") to include the SEC Staff's views regarding the interaction between Topic D-98 and SFAS No. 160. The revised Topic D-98 indicates that the classification, measurement, and earnings-per-share guidance required by Topic D-98 applies to noncontrolling interests (e.g., when the noncontrolling interest is redeemable at a fixed price by the holder or upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer). This includes noncontrolling interests redeemable at fair value. The revisions to Topic D-98 that are specific to accounting for noncontrolling interests should be applied no later than the effective date of SFAS No. 160. We are currently evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS No. 160 and Topic D-98 will have on the accounting and disclosure of our minority interest. In March 2008 the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 161"). The new standard is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. It is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 161 on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In April 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 142-3, "Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets." The FSP amends the factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets under SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The FSP affects entities with recognized intangible assets and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The new guidance applies to (1) intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets and (2) both intangible assets acquired in business combinations and asset acquisitions. We are currently evaluating the impact that adoption of the FSP will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Trend Information Sales In 2007, our consolidated revenues increased by 29% from $6,384.3 million to $8,252.4 million. Our subscriber base increased to 82.0 million subscribers as of December 31, 2007 from 72.9 million as of December 31, 2006, or by 12.5%. We expect further growth of our revenues and subscriber base in 2008, as we plan to expand our business through new acquisitions. In Russia, the average monthly service revenue per subscriber increased to $9 in 2007 from $8 in 2006 due to a combination of our sales and marketing efforts stimulating usage and increased wealth of our subscribers. In the future, we expect our monthly service revenue per subscriber to increase due to the growth of the average disposable income in Russia, increased usage of telecommunications services, 107 including value-added services, and the introduction of new specialized and attractive products and services to our subscribers. In Ukraine, our subscriber base remained stable at 20.0 million subscribers as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 amidst an oversaturated Ukrainian market and an intensely competitive environment. Average monthly service revenue per subscriber was $7 in each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 as a result of the aggressive marketing activities of our competitors offering low tariffs. We expect that the average monthly service revenue per subscriber will remain stable in 2008 due to the mix of attractive competitive tariffs and increased usage of telecommunication services. Our subscriber base in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Armenia grew by 2.9 million to 4.5 million subscribers in 2007, compared to 1.6 million subscribers in 2006. Of these countries, Uzbekistan had the largest subscriber base, with 2.8 subscribers as of December 31, 2007, as well as the most significant growth, with a 1.4 million increase in its subscriber base in 2007 compared to 2006. We expect that our subscriber base will continue to grow in these countries, which have low penetration rates relative to Russia and Ukraine. The average monthly service revenue per subscriber in these countries decreased from $11 in 2006 to $10 in 2007 for Uzbekistan and from $70 to $52 in Turkmenistan. The decrease is mainly attributable to the decrease in tariffs. We expect the average monthly service revenue per subscriber in these countries to decrease slightly or remain at the same level as a result of decreasing tariffs, offset by increased usage due to growth in personal income levels. Churn We define churn as the total number of subscribers who cease to be a subscriber during the period (whether involuntarily due to non-payment or voluntarily), expressed as a percentage of the average number of our subscribers during that period. The churn rate is highly dependent on competition in our license areas and those subscribers who migrate as a result of such competition. The slight decrease in our churn rate in Russia to 23.1% in 2007 as compared to 23.3% in 2006 is attributable mainly to our increased customer retention activities in 2007. The increase in churn rate during 2006 as compared to 2005 occurred mainly due to the aggressive pricing policies and promotions undertaken by our competitors. We expect that the churn rate in Russia will remain relatively stable in 2008 due to our customer retention efforts aimed at increasing subscriber loyalty. The churn rate in Ukraine significantly increased to 49.0% in 2007 as compared to 29.9% in 2006. This increase is primarily represented by the churn of prepaid subscribers, which increased from 39% in 2006 to 50% in 2007. Churn of contract, or postpaid subscribers, increased from 27% in 2006 to 29% in 2007. The substantial increase in the churn of prepaid subscribers was caused by two primary factors. First, the competitive environment among mobile operators in Ukraine has significantly intensified in recent years, while at the same time, the proportion of mass-market subscribers, including youth and low-income segment subscribers whose preferences are largely driven by tariff levels and simplified subscription conditions, has grown. As a result, a higher number of mass-market subscribers have migrated over to other operators offering lower tariffs and minimal subscription conditions. Second, our overall churn statistics include subscribers who moved from one tariff plan to another within MTS-Ukrainei.e., subscribers that did not migrate to another mobile operator, but rather, switched to a different tariff plan within the same mobile operator. Therefore, as our subscriber base in Ukraine remained relatively stable in 2007 as compared to 2006, we believe that the actual churn of subscribers who migrated to other mobile operators in 2007 is lower than 49%. We expect that the churn rate in Ukraine will remain relatively stable in 2008 due to our customer retention efforts aimed at increasing subscriber loyalty. 108 Technology We launched our 3G network in St. Petersburg, Russia in May 2008 and plan to develop and launch our 3G network in additional cities in Russia by the end of 2008, and in Uzbekistan and Armenia in 2009. The buildout of the 3G network requires us to implement new equipment and software, which will likely replace existing network equipment. If we are unable to continue using the existing equipment and software, we may be forced to depreciate this equipment, applying accelerated depreciation rates. In turn, this may cause an increase in depreciation charges and a consequent decrease in operating income in future periods. However, it is currently too early to assess the impact of the buildout of our 3G network. Off-balance Sheet Arrangements We believe that our existing off-balance sheet arrangements do not have and are not reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Obligations under guarantee contracts As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, our off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of the following debt guarantees issued on behalf of the related parties: Guaranteed amount outstanding at December 31, 2006 2007 (in millions) MTS Belarus 3.0  Total $ 3.0  We issued financial guarantees on behalf of MTS Belarus, our equity investee, to assist it with its financing needs. The guarantees expired in April 2007. Obligations under derivative contracts In July 2006, we acquired a 74.99% controlling stake in Dagtelecom, GSM-900 mobile services provider in the Republic of Dagestan, a region in southern Russia. In conjunction with this acquisition, we entered into a put and call option agreement to buy the remaining stake at fair market value within an exercise period commencing from September 1, 2009 and ending in July 2021 for the put option, and from 2009 to 2010 for the call option. The fair values of the option was $nil at December 31, 2007 and 2006. See Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements. In September 2007, we acquired an 80% stake in International Cell Holding Ltd., a 100% indirect owner of K-Telecom CJSC, a wireless telecommunication operator in Armenia. In connection with this acquisition, we also entered into a call and put option agreement for the remaining 20% stake to be exercised not earlier than July 2010. The exercise price will be determined by an independent investment bank at the date the option is exercised. The option is valid until July 2012. The option was accounted for at fair value, which was $nil at December 31, 2007. See Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements. In January 2006, we entered into variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement with HSBC Bank plc to hedge our exposure to variability of future cash flows caused by the change in EURIBOR related to the syndicated loan. We agreed with HSBC Bank plc to pay a fixed rate of 3.29% and 109 receive a variable interest of EURIBOR on EUR 26.0 million for the period from April 28, 2006 up to October 29, 2013. The instrument qualifies as a cash flow hedge under the requirements of SFAS No. 133 as amended by SFAS No. 149. As of December 31, 2007, we recorded an asset of $1.0 million in relation to this contract in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and an income of $0.8 million, net of tax of $0.2 million, as other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity in relation to the change in fair value of this agreement. In December 2007, we entered into several variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements with HSBC Bank plc, Rabobank, Citibank N.A. and ING Bank N.V. to hedge our exposure to variability of future cash flows caused by the change in LIBOR related to our outstanding debt. We agreed with HSBC Bank plc to pay a fixed rate of 4.14% and receive a variable interest of LIBOR on $96.1 million for the period from March 31, 2008 to September 30, 2014. The agreement with Rabobank was to pay a fixed rate of 4.16% and receive a variable interest of LIBOR on $86.1 million for the period from April 9, 2008 to April 9, 2014. We agreed with Citibank N.A. to pay a fixed rate of 4.29% and receive a variable interest of LIBOR on $53.5 million for the period from September 28, 2007 September 30, 2013. Two agreements were signed with ING Bank N.V. Under the first agreement, we will pay to ING Bank N.V. a fixed rate of 4.19% and receive a variable interest of LIBOR on $92.6 million for the period from February 29, 2008 to February 28, 2014. According to the terms of the second agreement, we will pay ING Bank N.V. a fixed rate of 4.41% and receive a variable interest of LIBOR on $67.0 million for the period from July 16, 2007 to January 15, 2014. As of December 31, 2007, we recorded a liability of $1.4 million in relation to the above hedge contracts in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and loss of $1.1 million, net of tax of $0.3 million, to other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity in relation to the change in fair value of these agreements. These instruments qualified as a cash flow hedges under the requirements of SFAS No. 133 as amended by SFAS No. 149. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding hedges are effective. Approximately $0.4 million is expected to be reclassified in net income during the next twelve months. See also Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements. In December 2005, our wholly-owned subsidiary MTS Finance S.A. acquired a 51.0% stake in Tarino Limited (Tarino) from Nomihold Securities Inc. (Nomihold) for $150.0 million in cash based on the belief that Tarino was at that time the indirect owner, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, of Bitel LLC, a Kyrgyz company holding a GSM 900/1800 license for the entire territory of Kyrgyzstan. Following the purchase of the 51.0% stake, MTS Finance entered into a put and call option agreement with Nomihold for "Option Shares," representing the remaining 49.0% interest in Tarino shares and a proportional interest in Bitel shares. The call option was exercisable by MTS Finance from November 22, 2005 to November 17, 2006, and the put option was exercisable by Nomihold from November 18, 2006 to December 8, 2006. The call and put option price was $170.0 million. The put and call options were recorded at fair value, which approximated $nil at December 31, 2005 in the consolidated balance sheet.

Compensation of Directors and Senior Management Executive Compensation Our officers and directors were paid during 2007 an aggregate amount of approximately $39.9 million for services in all capacities provided to us; this amount was comprised of $7.9 million in base salary and a $32.0 million bonus paid pursuant to a bonus plan for the management and directors whereby bonuses are awarded annually based on our financial performance. Members of the Board of Directors receive annual compensation of $250,000 (or $275,000 in the case of a director who serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors). A director serving as Chairman of a Board Committee receives additional annual compensation of $75,000. These amounts are paid net of taxes payable by a director on such compensation. We provide our directors with professional liability insurance and reimburse them for expenses incurred in connection with their attendance at Board meetings based on actual costs incurred, not to exceed $10,000 per month. 115 Stock Bonus Plan and Stock Option Plan Established in 2000 On April 27, 2000, contingent on the closing of our initial public offering, we established a stock bonus plan and stock option plan for selected officers, key employees and key advisors. Under the plans, directors, key employees and key advisors received 3,587,987 shares of our common stock and participate in a stock option plan under which they may receive options to purchase up to an additional 9,966,631 shares of our common stock. At the time of the initial public offering, we issued 13,554,618 shares of common stock to our subsidiary Rosico pursuant to these plans at a price of $1.024 per share for the total amount of $13.9 million. Following the merger of Rosico into us in June 2003, these shares were transferred to our wholly-owned subsidiary, MTS LLC. Under the stock option plan, board members and key employees, upon being granted stock options, will have the right to purchase up to 9,966,631 shares of our common stock. In August 2005, pursuant to option agreements, we granted options in respect of 699,705 shares of our common stock to our board members and 1,078,989 shares of our common stock to our key employees. These options have an exercise price of $6.89 per share, which represents the 100-day average market price of the shares at the date of grant and will vest 23 months from the date of the grant. The stock option agreement for a board member would have terminated if the board member was terminated as a board member before our 2006 annual shareholders' meeting. The stock option agreement for a key employee terminated for those employees who left us before July 15, 2007. In July 2007, board members and key employees purchased a total of 848,126 shares pursuant to the August 2005 option agreements and 968,313 shares were cancelled pursuant to the termination provisions described above. In June 2007, pursuant to option agreements, we granted options in respect of 700,000 shares of our common stock to our board members and 1,078,694 shares of our common stock to our key employees. These options have an exercise price of $6.31 per share, which represents the 100-day average market price of the shares at the date of grant and will vest in 24 months from the date of the grant. The stock option agreement for a board member will terminate if the board member is terminated as a board member before our 2008 annual shareholders' meeting. The stock option agreement for a key employee will terminate if the employee leaves us before July 15, 2009. Compensation costs under the above stock option plan of $2.8 million, $1.7 million and $1.5 million were recognized in our consolidated statements of operations during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, there is $3.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock-based compensation awards under this stock option plan. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.54 years. Employee Motivation and Retention Program Established in 2007 In June 2007, our board of directors approved an employee motivation and retention program to provide deferred compensation to certain of our key employees. The original program contemplated the award of phantom shares based on our ADSs to certain top- and mid-level managers and allocated phantom shares representing up to 3,600,000 ADSs for the program. The program was amended in May 2008 to increase the number of phantom shares eligible to cover up to 9,556,716 ADSs as well as to add a stock option component for up to 651,035 of our actual ADSs. As amended, the program provides that up to 420 top- and mid-level managers will be eligible to participate in the phantom share program. The phantom shares are expected to be awarded through 2011, and the vesting periods for the phantom shares awarded will be up to two years following the award contingent upon the recipient's continuing employment with us. The award will vest only if, at 116 the end of the vesting period we are among the top 20 mobile operators in the world and the top mobile operator in Russia and CIS, in each case, in terms of revenue and the cumulative percentage of our market capitalization growth since the grant date exceeds the cumulative cost of equity determined by the Board of Directors. At the end of the vesting period, participants in the phantom share program will be entitled to a cash payment equal to the difference between the initial grant price and the exercise price of phantom shares, multiplied by the number of phantom shares granted. The initial grant price is determined based on the average market ADS price during the hundred day period preceding the grant date. The exercise price of phantom shares is determined based on average market ADS price during the hundred day period preceding the vesting date. The amended program also provides for the award to our chief executive officer of stock options for up to 651,035 of our ADSs. The first tranch of 390 621 stock options was granted in May 2008. The vesting period is two years from the grant date, contingent upon the continued employment of the chief executive officer by us. The award will vest only if, at the end of the vesting period, we are among the top 20 mobile operators in the world and the top mobile operator in Russia and CIS, in each case, in terms of revenue and the cumulative percentage of our market capitalization growth since the grant date exceeds the cumulative cost of equity determined by the Board of Directors. Stock options that were granted in May 2008 have an exercise price of $75.25 per ADS. The exercise price of stock options that are expected be granted in July 2008 will be determined based on the average market ADS price during the hundred day period preceding the grant date. In 2007, we granted phantom shares to key employees representing 720,000 ADSs. These phantom shares have an exercise price of $57 per ADS, which represents the 100-day average market price of the ADS at the date of grant and will vest in 24 months from the date of the grant. The phantom option agreement for a key employee will terminate if the employee leaves us before July 1, 2009. The compensation cost under the phantom share program recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 amounted to $7.6 million, and the related deferred tax benefit amounted to $1.8 million. The respective liability of $7.6 million was included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, there was $23.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested phantom shares. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years. Prior to December 31, 2005, we accounted for stock options issued to employees under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, Compensation" ("APB No.25"), as permitted by FASB Statement No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No.123") and SFAS No. 148 "Accounting for Stock Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure, an Amendment to FASB Statement No. 123." Under the requirements of these statements, we elected to use the intrinsic method to measure share-based awards for the purposes of recording share-based compensation expense for awards granted to employees. Effective from January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 123R "Share based payments" (SFAS No. 123R), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123. Under SFAS No. 123R companies must calculate and record the cost of equity instruments, such as stock options awarded to employees for services received, in their income statement. The cost of the equity instruments is to be measured based on the fair value of the instruments on the day they are granted (with certain exceptions) and is recognized over the period during which the employees are required to provide services in exchange for equity instruments. We adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified-prospective-application transition method. Under this transition method, compensation cost for all share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet 117 vested as of December 31, 2006, was determined based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original requirements of SFAS No. 123, using the same assumptions and taken into account the estimated forfeitures. In accordance with Russian legislation, our board members and key employees may be considered insiders with respect to us, and thus may be restricted from selling their shares. C. Board Practices Board of Directors Members of our Board of Directors are elected by a majority vote of shareholders at the annual shareholders' meeting using a cumulative voting system. Directors are typically elected by the annual meeting of shareholders for one year until the next annual meeting of shareholders and may be re-elected an unlimited number of times. The Board currently consists of seven members, although we expect that this number will be increased to nine members by a shareholders resolution at our annual shareholders' meeting to be held on June 27, 2008 due to the Joint Stock Companies Law requirement that companies with more than 10,000 holders of voting shares have a board of directors consisting of not less than nine members. The Board has the authority to make overall management decisions for us, except those matters reserved to the shareholders. It must meet at least once a month, though it may meet more often at its election. The members of our Board do not serve pursuant to a contract. In 2004, the Board of Directors approved the establishment of, and guidelines for, three new Board Committees: Restructuring Committee, Budgeting Committee and Quality Committee. The Restructuring Committee was established to oversee and address matters related to the development and implementation of a new organizational structure for our business. The Budgeting Committee was established to prepare recommendations to the Board of Directors on issues relating to the preparation, approval and supervision of our budgets, long-term business plans and investment plans. The Quality Committee was organized to manage issues relating to the quality of our cellular network's operation. The Board of Directors also approved a Code of Ethics applicable to our senior officers. In June 2006, after the completion of our restructuring and the establishment of our new organizational structure, the Restructuring Committee was dissolved. In 2006, the Board of Directors approved the establishment of, and guidelines for, two new Board Committees: Remuneration and Appointments Committee and the Committee for Corporate Conduct and Ethics. We established the Remuneration and Appointments Committee to develop proposals to be presented to the Board of Directors with respect to structuring remuneration and compensation levels for management executives. The Committee for Corporate Conduct and Ethics was established to maintain an effective corporate governance system and to further enhance the quality of corporate management. In 2007, the Board of Directors approved the establishment of, and guidelines for, two new Board Committees: the Strategy Committee and the Tender and Procurement Committee. We established the Strategy Committee to improve the efficiency and performance of our Board of Directors by considering and making recommendations to the Board of Directors on matters relating to our strategy. The Tender and Procurement Committee was established to optimize our costs with respect to the procurement of technological equipment and software. The Tender and Procurement Committee makes recommendations to the Board of Directors with respect to our general approach to procurement and generally considers major procurement transactions likely to have a material impact on our development. 118 Audit Committee Our Audit Committee consists of two members appointed by the Board of Directors. The current members are Mr. Mohanbir Singh Gyani and Mr. Paul James Ostling, who are both independent members of the Board of Directors. Mr. Ostling serves as Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is primarily responsible for the integrity of our financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, assuring the qualifications and independence of our independent auditors and overseeing the audit process, including audit fees, resolving matters arising during the course of audits and coordinating internal audit functions. According to the bylaws, the Audit Committee shall convene with our external auditors at least four times a year, but may convene more frequently if the Audit Committee chooses to do so. Remuneration and Appointments Committee Our Remuneration and Appointments Committee was established on March 28, 2006, and consists of four members appointed by the Board of Directors. The current members are Tatiana V. Evtushenkova, Alexei N. Buyanov, Vitaliy G. Saveliev and Paul J. Ostling, who serves as Chairman of the Remuneration and Appointments Committee. The Remuneration and Appointments Committee is primarily responsible for developing a remuneration structure and compensation levels for management executives. According to the bylaws, the Remuneration and Appointments Committee shall be convened by the Chairman of the Remuneration and Appointments Committee, at his sole discretion, or at the suggestion of any member of this committee, a member of the Board of Directors or our President. President Our President is elected by the Board of Directors for a term of up to three years. The rights, obligations and the times and amounts of payment for the President's services are determined by a contract between him and us, as represented by our Chairman or by a person authorized by our Board of Directors. The President is responsible for day-to-day management of our activities, except for matters reserved to our shareholders or the Board of Directors and the Management Board. The President reports to the shareholders' meeting and to the Board of Directors and is responsible for carrying out decisions made by the shareholders and by the Board of Directors and the Management Board. Mikhail V. Shamolin was elected as our President and CEO on May 29, 2008 by the Board of Directors for a term of three years. Management Board In October 2006, we revised our charter to establish a new governing body called the Management Board. The Management Board is an executive body which oversees certain aspects of our ongoing activities. The Management Board can consist of up to fifteen members with each member being nominated by the President and approved by the Board of Directors. The Management Board is formed for a period of time determined by the Board of Directors, but the duration of the Management Board's term cannot exceed that of the President, who is elected by the Board of Directors for a term of up to three years. The Chairman of the Management Board is the President. Currently, our Management Board consists of eleven members. See "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and EmployeesA.

TS-Retail In November 2006, we established a wholly-owned subsidiary, TS-Retail, with a registered capital of $1.1 million for further expansion of our retail operations. In December 2007, following the execution of a business development plan, TS-Retail carried out an increase in charter capital up to $14.0 million which was bought out by us ($2.4 million) and other subsidiaries of Sistema ($11.6 million). As a result of the transaction, our stake in TS-Retail decreased to 25%. We deconsolidated TS-Retail since that date and subsequently accounted for this investment under the equity method. During 2007, we granted a loan to TS-Retail in the amount of $8.6 million. TS-Retail now serves as our dealer and we paid dealers' commissions in the amount of $1.1 million during the period ended March 31, 2008.

Financial Information A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information 8.A.1-3. See Item 18. 8.A.4-5. Not applicable. 8.A.7. Litigation UMC On June 7, 2004, the General Prosecutor of Ukraine filed a claim against us and others in the Kiev Commercial Court seeking to unwind the sale by Ukrtelecom of its 51% stake in UMC to us. The 124 complaint also sought an order prohibiting us from alienating 51% of our stake in UMC until the claim was resolved on the merits. The claim was based on a provision of the Ukrainian privatization law that included Ukrtelecom among a list of "strategic" state holdings prohibited from alienating or encumbering its assets during the course of its privatization. While the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine in May 2001 issued a decree specifically authorizing the sale by Ukrtelecom of its entire stake in UMC, the General Prosecutor asserted that the decree contradicted the privatization law and that the sale by Ukrtelecom was therefore illegal and should be unwound. On August 12, 2004, the Kiev Commercial Court rejected the General Prosecutor's claim. On August 26, 2004, the General Prosecutor requested the Constitutional Court of Ukraine to review whether certain provisions of the Ukrainian privatization law limiting the alienation of assets by privatized companies were applicable to the sale by Ukrtelecom of UMC shares to us. As of the date of this document, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine has not yet responded to the General Prosecutor's request. Bitel In December 2005, our wholly-owned subsidiary MTS Finance acquired a 51.0% stake in Tarino Limited (Tarino) from Nomihold Securities Inc. (Nomihold) for $150.0 million in cash based on the belief that Tarino was at that time the indirect owner, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, of Bitel LLC, a Kyrgyz company holding a GSM 900/1800 license for the entire territory of Kyrgyzstan. Following the purchase of the 51.0% stake, MTS Finance entered into a put and call option agreement with Nomihold for "Option Shares" representing the remaining 49.0% interest in Tarino (and, therefore, the remaining shares in Bitel). The call option was exercisable by MTS Finance from November 22, 2005 to November 17, 2006, and the put option was exercisable by Nomihold from November 18, 2006 to December 8, 2006. The call and put option price was $170.0 million. Following a decision of the Kyrgyz Supreme Court on December 15, 2005, Bitel's corporate offices were seized by a third party. As we did not regain operational control over Bitel's operations in 2005, we accounted for our 51.0% investment in Bitel at cost as at December 31, 2005. We appealed the decision of the Kyrgyz Supreme Court in 2006, but the court has not acted within the time period permitted for appeal. We subsequently sought the review of this dispute over the ownership of Bitel by the Prosecutor General of Kyrgyzstan to determine whether further investigation could be undertaken by the Kyrgyz authorities. In January 2007, the Prosecutor General informed us that there were no grounds for involvement by the Prosecutor General's office in the dispute and that no legal basis existed for us to appeal the decision of the Kyrgyz Supreme Court. Consequently, we decided to write off the costs relating to the purchase of the 51% stake in Bitel, which has been reflected in our annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006. In November 2006, MTS Finance received a letter from Nomihold purporting to exercise the put option and sell the Option Shares for $170.0 million to MTS Finance. In January 2007, Nomihold commenced an arbitration proceeding against MTS Finance in the London Court of International Arbitration in order to compel MTS Finance to purchase the remaining shares. Nomihold seeks specific performance of the put option, unspecified monetary damages, interest and costs. The matter is currently pending. MTS Finance is vigorously contesting this action and has asked the arbitration tribunal to dismiss Nomihold's claim. A group of individual shareholders of Sistema has agreed to compensate MTS Finance for any potential loss up to $170 million should the arbitration decision regarding exercise of the aforementioned put option prove unfavorable to MTS Finance. Notwithstanding this, in the event MTS Finance does not prevail in the arbitration, we could be liable to Nomihold for $170.0 million plus any additional amounts that the arbitration tribunal might award to Nomihold. In connection with the above mentioned put option exercise and the uncertainty as to the resolution of the dispute with Nomihold, we recognized a liability in the amount of $170.0 million for 125 the purposes of our annual consolidated financial statements with a corresponding charge to other non-operation expenses as of December 31, 2006 and for the year then ended. In addition, three Isle of Man companies affiliated with us (KFG Companies) have been named defendants in lawsuits filed by Bitel in the Isle of Man seeking the return of dividends received by these three companies in the first quarter of 2005 from Bitel in the amount of approximately $25.2 million plus compensatory damages, and to recover approximately $3.7 million in losses and accrued interest. In the event that the defendants do not prevail in these lawsuits, we may be liable to Bitel for such claims. The KFG Companies have also asserted counterclaims against Bitel, and claims against other defendants including Altimo and Altimo Holding, for the wrongful appropriation and control of Bitel. In November 2007, the Isle of Man court set aside orders it had previously issued granting leave to serve the non-Manx defendants out of the jurisdiction as to the KFG Companies' counterclaims on the basis of a lack of jurisdiction. The ruling is now on appeal to the Isle of Man Staff of Government and a decision from that appellate court is expected sometime in 2008. It is not possible at this time to predict the outcome or resolution of these claims. In a separate arbitration proceeding initiated against the KFG Companies by Kyrgyzstan Mobitel Investment Company Limited (KMIC) under the rules of the London Court of International Arbitration, the arbitration tribunal in its award found that the KFG Companies breached a May 31, 2003 Transfer Agreement concerning the shares of Bitel. The Transfer Agreement was made between the KFG Companies and IPOC International Growth Fund Limited (IPOC) although IPOC subsequently assigned its interest to KMIC, and KMIC was the claimant in the arbitration. The tribunal ruled that the KFG Companies breached the Transfer Agreement when they failed to establish a date on which the equity interests in Bitel were to be transferred to KMIC and by failing to take other steps to transfer the Bitel interests. This breach occurred prior to MTS Finance's acquisition of the KFG Companies. The arbitration tribunal ruled that KMIC is entitled only to damages in an amount to be determined in future proceedings. At the request of the parties, the tribunal agreed to stay the damages phase of the proceedings pending the resolution of the appeals process now before the second instance court in the Isle of Man, as described above. We are not able to predict the outcome of these proceedings or the amount of damages to be paid, if any. For additional information, see Note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements. Tax Audits and Claims In the ordinary course of business, we may be party to various legal and tax proceedings, and subject to claims, some of which relate to the developing markets and evolving fiscal and regulatory environments in which we operate. In the opinion of management, our liability, if any, in all pending litigation, other legal proceedings or other matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. We believe that we have adequately provided for tax liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements; however, the risk remains that relevant authorities could take differing positions with regard to interpretive issues and the effect could be significant. See also Note 20 to our annual consolidated financial statements. Russia In September 2006, the Russian tax authorities audited our compliance with tax legislation for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004. Based on the results of this audit, the Russian tax authorities assessed approximately $52.3 million of additional taxes, penalties and fines. We challenged this assessment in the Moscow Arbitration Court. In February 2007, this court invalidated the largest part of the tax assessment in the amount of approximately $49.7 million. This ruling was upheld by higher courts, most recently, in May 2008 by the Federal Arbitration Court of the Moscow District. As of 126 December 31, 2007, no provision in relation to the above tax audit was accrued in our financial statements or paid to tax authorities. Generally, according to Russian tax legislation, tax declarations remain open and subject to inspection for a period of three years following the tax year. As of December 31, 2007, our and our Russian subsidiaries' tax declarations for the preceding three fiscal years were open for further review, assuming no resolution issued based on the results of tax audit of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006. In January 2008, the Russian tax authorities initiated an audit of our compliance with tax legislation for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006. As of the date of this report, the audit has been suspended by the tax authorities. Ukraine There are regulatory uncertainties in Ukraine related to the treatment for VAT purposes of contributions payable to the Ukrainian State Pension Fund ("Pension Fund") in respect of the cash paid for the consumption of telecommunication services by customers. As a result of a tax audit of UMC for the period from October 1, 2002 to June 30, 2004, the tax authorities assessed additional VAT charges (including penalties) calculated on the Pension Fund contributions in the amount of $11.5 million. In 2005, UMC initiated claim in respect of this issue against the tax authorities, and received a favorable ruling from the court upheld on appeal by higher courts (most recently, by the Highest Administrative Court of Ukraine in December 2006). These court rulings are based on the provisions of the Ukrainian Law on VAT that were in effect until March 2005. This law was amended in March 2005 and August 2005. Management believes that the version of the law that came in effect in August 2005 clearly exempts Pension Fund contributions from VAT. However, the wording of the law that was in effect from March 2005 to August 2005 may be interpreted by the tax authorities as requiring us to pay the VAT on such contributions. The most recent tax audit of UMC for the period from July 1, 2004 to April 1, 2007 specifically set aside the Pension Fund contribution taxation matter for later consideration. Management believes that VAT was not applicable to the Pension Fund contributions. Further, management believes that UMC is in line with industry practice and has already defended its position in the courts. At December 31, 2007, no VAT charges in relation to the above litigation were accrued in our financial statements or paid to the tax authorities. 8.A.8. Dividend Distribution Policy On May 15, 2007, the Board of Directors approved a dividend policy, whereby we will aim to make dividend payments to our shareholders in the amount of at least 50% of our annual net income under U.S. GAAP. The dividend amount could vary depending on a number of factors, including the outlook for earnings growth, capital expenditure requirements, cash flow from operations, potential acquisition opportunities, as well as our debt position. On June 29, 2007, the annual general meeting of shareholders approved annual cash dividends in the amount of $747.2 million (including dividends on treasury shares of $6.0 million) for the full year 2006, of which $0.8 million remained payable as of December 31, 2007. Annual dividend payments, if any, must be recommended by our Board of Directors and approved by the annual general meeting of shareholders. We anticipate that any dividends we may pay in the future on the shares represented by the ADSs will be declared and paid to the depositary in rubles and will be converted into U.S. dollars by the depositary and distributed to holders of ADSs, net of the depositary's fees and expenses. Accordingly, the value of dividends received by holders of ADSs will be subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the ruble and the dollar. 127 B. Significant Changes Change to Management On May 29, 2008, our President and CEO, Leonid Melamed, was appointed as President and CEO of Sistema, our controlling shareholder, effective May 30, 2008. On May 29, 2008, our Board of Directors elected Mikhail Shamolin as our President and CEO, effective May 30, 2008. See "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and EmployeesA. Directors and Senior Management." Mergers On April 30, 2008, the Russian registration authorities approved the merger of Astrakhan Mobile and Mar Mobile GSM, our wholly-owned subsidiaries located in the Russian Federation, into MTS OJSC.

Charter and Certain Requirements of Russian Legislation We describe below material provisions of our charter in effect on the date of this document and certain requirements of Russian legislation. In addition to this description, we urge you to review our charter to learn its complete terms. Our Purpose Article 2.1 of our charter provides that our principal purpose is to obtain profits through the planning, marketing and operation of a radiotelephone mobile cellular network on our license territories. We are registered with the Ministry of Taxes and Duties of the Russian Federation under the state registration number 1027700149124. General Matters Pursuant to our charter, we have the right to issue registered common stock, preferred stock and other securities provided for by legal acts of the Russian Federation with respect to securities. Our capital stock currently consists of 1,993,326,138 common shares, each with a nominal value of 0.1 rubles, all of which are issued and fully paid. Under Russian legislation, charter capital refers to the aggregate nominal value of the issued and outstanding shares. We are also authorized to issue an additional 103,649,654 common shares with a nominal value of 0.1 rubles each. No preferred shares are authorized or outstanding. Preferred stock may only be issued if corresponding amendments have been made to our charter pursuant to a resolution of the general meeting of shareholders. We have issued only common stock. The Joint Stock Companies Law requires us to dispose of any of our shares that we acquire within one year of their acquisition or, failing that, reduce our charter capital. We refer to such shares as treasury shares for the purposes hereof. Russian legislation does not allow for the voting of such treasury shares. As of the date of this document, we had more than ten thousand shareholders for purposes of the Joint Stock Companies Law. Rights Attaching to Shares Holders of our common stock have the right to vote at all shareholders' meetings. As required by the Joint Stock Companies Law and our charter, all shares of our common stock have the same nominal value and grant identical rights to their holders. Each fully paid share of common stock, except for treasury shares, gives its holder the right to: freely transfer the shares without consent of other shareholders; receive dividends; participate in shareholders' meetings and vote on all matters within shareholders' competence; transfer voting rights to other Company's shareholders or a representative on the basis of a power of attorney; participate in the election and dismissal of members of the board of directors and review commission; if holding, alone or with other holders, 2% or more of the voting stock, within 100 days after the end of our fiscal year, make proposals for the agenda of the annual shareholders' meeting and nominate candidates to the board of directors, the counting commission, the review commission and for company president; 130 if holding, alone or with other holders, 10% or more of the voting stock, demand from the board of directors the calling of an extraordinary shareholders' meeting or an unscheduled audit by the review commission or an independent auditor; demand, under the following circumstances, the repurchase by us of all or some of the shares owned by it, as long as such holder voted against or did not participate in the voting on the decision approving the following: any reorganization; the conclusion of a major transaction, as defined under Russian law; any amendment of our charter or approval of a restated version of our charter in a manner that restricts the holder's rights; and upon liquidation, receive a proportionate amount of our property after our obligations are fulfilled; have free access to certain company documents, receive copies for a reasonable fee and, if holding alone or with other holders, 25% or more of the voting stock, have access to accounting documents; and exercise other rights of a shareholder provided by our charter, Russian legislation and decisions of shareholders' meeting approved in accordance with its competence. Preemptive Rights The Joint Stock Companies Law and our charter provide existing shareholders with a preemptive right to purchase shares or securities convertible into shares during an open subscription in the amount proportionate to their existing shareholdings. In addition, the Joint Stock Companies Law provides shareholders with a preemptive right to purchase shares or securities convertible into shares, in an amount proportionate to their existing shareholdings, during a closed subscription if the shareholders voted against or did not participate in the voting on the decision approving such subscription. The preemptive right does not apply to a closed subscription to the existing shareholders provided that such shareholders may each acquire a whole number of shares or securities convertible into shares being placed in an amount proportion to their existing shareholdings. We must provide shareholders with written notice of the proposed sale of shares at least 45 days prior to the offering, during which time shareholders may exercise their preemptive rights. Dividends The Joint Stock Companies Law and our charter set forth the procedure for determining the quarterly and annual dividends that we may distribute to our shareholders. We may declare dividends based on our first quarter, six month, nine month or annual results. Dividends are recommended to a shareholders' meeting by a majority vote of the board of directors and approved by the shareholders by a majority vote. A decision on quarterly, six month and nine month dividends must be taken within three months of the end of the respective quarter at the shareholders' meeting; and a decision on annual dividends must be taken at the annual general shareholders' meeting. The dividend approved at the shareholders' meeting may not be more than the amount recommended by the board of directors. Dividends shall be paid up until the end of the year on which the decision to make the payment has been adopted, unless the shareholders' decision provides for a lesser term. Dividends are distributed to holders of our shares as of the record date for the shareholders' meeting approving the dividends. See "General Shareholders' MeetingsNotice and Participation" below. 131 The Joint Stock Companies Law allows dividends to be declared only out of net profits calculated under Russian accounting standards as long as the following conditions have been met: the charter capital of the company has been paid in full; the value of the company's net assets on the date of the adoption of the decision to pay dividends is not less (and would not become less as a result of the proposed dividend payment) than the sum of the company's charter capital, the company's reserve fund and the difference between the liquidation value and the par value of the issued and outstanding preferred stock of the company; the company has repurchased all shares from shareholders having the right to demand repurchase; and the company is not, and would not become, insolvent as the result of the proposed dividend payment. Distributions to Shareholders on Liquidation Under Russian legislation, liquidation of a company results in its termination without the transfer of rights and obligations to other persons as legal successors. The Joint Stock Companies Law and our charter allows us to be liquidated: by a three-quarters majority vote of a shareholders' meeting; or by a court order. Following a decision to liquidate us, the right to manage our affairs would pass to a liquidation commission appointed by a shareholders' meeting. In the event of an involuntary liquidation, the court may assign the duty to liquidate the company to its shareholders. Creditors may file claims within a period to be determined by the liquidation commission, but such period must not be less than two months from the date of publication of notice of liquidation by the liquidation commission. The Civil Code of the Russian Federation gives creditors the following order of priority during liquidation: individuals owed compensation for injuries, deaths or moral damages; employees; federal and local governmental entities claiming taxes and similar payments to the federal and local budgets and to non-budgetary funds; and other creditors in accordance with Russian legislation. Claims of creditors in obligations secured by a pledge of the company's property ("secured claims") are satisfied out of the proceeds of sale of the pledged property prior to claims of any other creditors except for the creditors of the first and second priorities described above, provided that claims of such creditors arose before the pledge agreements in respect of the company's property were made. To the extent that the proceeds of sale of the pledged property are not sufficient to satisfy secured claims, the latter are satisfied simultaneously with claims of the fourth priority creditors as described above. The Federal Law on Insolvency (Bankruptcy), however, provides for a different order of priority for creditors' claims in the event of bankruptcy. 132 The remaining assets of a company are distributed among shareholders in the following order of priority: payments to repurchase shares from shareholders having the right to demand repurchase; payments of declared but unpaid dividends on preferred shares and the liquidation value of the preferred shares determined by the company's charter, if any; and payments to holders of common and preferred shares. Liability of Shareholders The Civil Code of the Russian Federation and the Joint Stock Companies Law generally provide that shareholders in a Russian joint stock company are not liable for the obligations of a joint stock company and bear only the risk of loss of their investments. This may not be the case, however, when one company is capable of determining decisions made by another company. The company capable of determining such decisions is called an "effective parent." The company whose decisions are capable of being so determined is called an "effective subsidiary." The effective parent bears joint and several responsibility for transactions concluded by the effective subsidiary in carrying out these decisions if: this decision-making capability is provided for in the charter of the effective subsidiary or in a contract between such persons; and the effective parent gives binding instructions to the effective subsidiary. Thus, a shareholder of an effective parent is not itself liable for the debts of the effective parent's effective subsidiary, unless that shareholder is itself an effective parent of the effective parent. Accordingly, a shareholder will not be personally liable for our debts or those of our effective subsidiaries unless such shareholder controls our business and the conditions set forth above are met. In addition, an effective parent is secondarily liable for an effective subsidiary's debts if an effective subsidiary becomes insolvent or bankrupt resulting from the action or omission of an effective parent only when the effective parent has used the right to give binding instructions, knowing that the consequence of carrying out this action would be insolvency of this effective subsidiary. This is the case no matter how the effective parent's capability to determine decisions of the effective subsidiary arises, such as through ownership of voting securities or by contract. In these instances, other shareholders of the effective subsidiary may claim compensation for the effective subsidiary's losses from the effective parent that caused the effective subsidiary to take any action or fail to take any action knowing that such action or failure to take action would result in losses. Alteration of Capital Charter Capital Increase We may increase our charter capital by issuing new shares; or increasing the nominal value of previously issued shares. A decision on any issuance of shares or securities convertible into shares by closed subscription, or an issuance by open subscription of common shares or securities convertible into common shares constituting 25% or more of the number of issued common shares, requires a three-quarters majority vote of a shareholders' meeting. Otherwise, a decision to increase the charter capital by increasing the nominal value of issued shares requires a majority vote of a shareholders' meeting. In certain circumstances provided in our charter, a decision to increase the charter capital may be taken by our board of directors. In addition, the issuance of shares above the number provided in our charter 133 necessitates a charter amendment, which requires a three-quarters affirmative vote of a shareholders' meeting. The Joint Stock Companies Law requires that the value of newly issued shares be determined by the board of directors based on their market value but not less than their nominal value, except in limited circumstances where (i) existing shareholders exercise a preemptive right to purchase shares at not less than 90% of the price paid by third parties, or (ii) fees up to 10% are paid to intermediaries, in which case the fees paid may be deducted from the price. The price may not be set at less than the nominal value of the shares. The board of directors shall value any in-kind contributions for the new shares, based on the appraisal report of an independent appraiser. Russian securities regulations set out detailed procedures for the issuance and registration of shares of a joint stock company. These procedures require: prior registration of a share issuance with the Federal Service for Financial Markets (hereinafterFSFM); public disclosure of information relating to the share issuance; and following the placement of the shares, registration and public disclosure of the results of the placement of shares. Charter Capital Decrease; Share Buy-Backs The Joint Stock Companies Law does not allow a company to reduce its charter capital below the minimum charter capital required by law, which is 100,000 rubles for an open joint stock company. The Joint Stock Companies Law and our charter require that any decision to reduce our charter capital, whether through the repurchase and cancellation of shares or a reduction in the nominal value of the shares, be made by a majority vote of a shareholders' meeting. Additionally, within 30 days of a decision to reduce our charter capital, we must issue a written notice to our creditors and publish this decision. Our creditors would then have the right to demand, within 30 days of such notice or publication or receipt of our notice, early termination of relevant obligations by us, as well as compensation for damages. The Joint Stock Companies Law and our charter allow our shareholders or the board of directors to authorize the repurchase of up to 10% of our shares in exchange for cash. The repurchased shares pursuant to a board decision must be resold at the market price within one year of their repurchase or, failing that, the shareholders must decide to cancel such shares and decrease the charter capital. Repurchased shares do not bear voting rights. Shares repurchased pursuant to a decision of our shareholders' meeting to decrease the overall number of shares are cancelled at their redemption. The Joint Stock Companies Law allows us to repurchase our shares only if, at the time of repurchase: our charter capital is paid in full; we are not and would not become, as a result of the repurchase, insolvent; the value of our net assets at the time of repurchase of our shares is not less (and would not become less, as a result of the proposed repurchase) than the sum of our charter capital, the reserve fund and the difference between the liquidation value and par value of our issued and outstanding preferred shares; and we have repurchased all shares from shareholders having the right to demand repurchase of their shares in accordance with Russian law, as described immediately below. 134 The Joint Stock Companies Law and our charter provide that our shareholders may demand repurchase of all or some of their shares as long as the shareholder demanding repurchase voted against or did not participate in the voting on the decision approving any of the following actions: reorganization; conclusion of a major transaction, as defined under Russian law; or amendment of our charter or approval of a restated version of our charter in a manner which restricts shareholders' rights. We may spend up to 10% of our net assets calculated under Russian accounting standards on the date of the adoption of the decision which gives rise to a share redemption demanded by the shareholders. If the value of shares in respect of which shareholders have exercised their right to demand repurchase exceeds 10% of our net assets, we will repurchase shares from each such shareholder on a pro-rata basis. Repurchase of the shares is at a price agreed on by the board of directors, but shall not be less than the market price determined by an independent appraiser. Registration and Transfer of Shares Russian legislation requires that a joint stock company maintains a register of its shareholders. Ownership of our registered shares is evidenced solely by entries made in such register. Any of our shareholders may obtain an extract from our register certifying the number of shares that such shareholder holds. Since May 10, 2000, Registrar NIKoil OJSC has maintained our register of shareholders. The purchase, sale or other transfer of shares is accomplished through the registration of the transfer in the shareholder register, or the registration of the transfer with a depositary if shares are held by a depositary. The registrar or depositary may not require any documents in addition to those required by Russian legislation in order to transfer shares in the register. Refusal to register the shares in the name of the transferee or, upon request of the beneficial holder, in the name of a nominee holder, is not allowed, except in certain instances provided for by Russian legislation, and may be challenged in court. Reserve Fund Russian legislation requires that each joint stock company establish a reserve fund to be used only to cover the company's losses, redeem the company's bonds and repurchase the company's shares in cases when other funds are not available. Our charter provides for a reserve fund of 15% of our charter capital, funded through mandatory annual transfers of at least 5% of our net profits until the reserve fund has reached the 15% requirement. Disclosure of Information Russian securities regulations require us to make the following periodic public disclosures and filings: filing quarterly reports with the FSFM, containing information about us, our shareholders and depositary, the structure of our management bodies, the members of the board of directors, our branches and representative offices, our shares, bank accounts and auditors, important developments during the reporting quarter, and other information about our financial and business activity; filing with the FSFM and publishing any information concerning material facts and changes in our financial and business activity, including our reorganization, certain changes in the amount 135 of our assets, decisions on share issuances, certain changes in ownership and shareholding as well as shareholder resolutions; disclosing information on various stages of share placement, issuance and registration through publication of certain data as required by the securities regulations; disclosing our charter and internal corporate governance documents on our website; disclosing our annual report and annual financial statements prepared in accordance with Russian accounting standards; filing with the FSFM on a quarterly basis a list of our affiliated companies and individuals; and other information as required by applicable Russian securities legislation. General Shareholders' Meetings Procedure The powers of a shareholders' meeting are set forth in the Joint Stock Companies Law and in our charter. A shareholders' meeting may not decide on issues that are not included in the list of its competence by the Joint Stock Companies Law and our charter. Among the issues which the shareholders have the exclusive power to decide are: charter amendments; reorganization or liquidation; election and removal of members of the board of directors; determination of the amount of compensation for members of the board of directors; determination of the number, nominal value, class/type of authorized shares and the rights granted by such shares; changes in our charter capital; appointment and removal of our external auditor and of the members of our review commission and counting commission; approval of certain interested party transactions and major transactions; decision on our participation in holding companies, commercial or industrial groups, or other associations of commercial entities; approval of certain internal documents and corporate records; distribution of profits and losses, including approval of dividends; redemption by the company of issued shares in cases provided by the Joint Stock Companies Law; and other issues, as provided for by the Joint Stock Companies Law and our charter. Voting at a shareholders' meeting is generally based on the principle of one vote per share of common stock, with the exception of the election of the board of directors, which is done through cumulative voting. Decisions are generally passed by a majority vote of the voting shares present at a shareholders' meeting. However, Russian law requires a three-quarters majority vote of the voting shares present at a shareholders' meeting to approve the following: charter amendments; 136 reorganization or liquidation; major transactions involving assets in excess of 50% of the balance sheet value of the company's assets; determination of the number, nominal value, and category (type) of authorized shares and the rights granted by such shares; repurchase by the company of its issued shares; any issuance of shares or securities convertible into shares of common stock by closed subscription; or issuance by open subscription of shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock, in each case, constituting 25% or more of the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The quorum requirement for our shareholders' meetings is met if holders of shares (or their representatives) accounting for more than 50% of the issued voting shares are present. If the 50% quorum requirement is not met, another shareholders' meeting with the same agenda may (and, in case of an annual shareholders' meeting must) be scheduled and the quorum requirement is satisfied if holders of shares (or their representatives) accounting for at least 30% of the issued voting shares are present at that meeting. The annual shareholders' meeting must be convened by the board of directors between March 1 and June 30 of each year, and the agenda must include the following items: election of the members of the board of directors; election of the counting commission; approval of the annual report and the annual financial statements, including the balance sheet and profit and loss statement; approval of distribution of profits, including approval of dividends, and losses, if any; appointment of an independent auditor; and appointment of the members of the review commission. A shareholder or group of shareholders owning in the aggregate at least 2% of the issued voting shares may introduce proposals for the agenda of the annual shareholders' meeting and may nominate candidates for the board of directors, counting commission and review commission. Any agenda proposals or nominations must be provided to the company no later than 100 calendar days after the preceding financial year end. Extraordinary shareholders' meetings may be called by the board of directors on its own initiative, or at the request of the review commission, the independent auditor or a shareholder or group of shareholders owning in the aggregate at least 10% of the issued voting shares as of the date of the request. The decision by the board of directors to call or reject the call for an extraordinary shareholders' meeting shall be sent to the party that requested the meeting within three days after such a decision was made. A general meeting of shareholders may be held in a form of a meeting or by absentee ballot. The form of a meeting contemplates the adoption of resolutions by the general meeting of shareholders through the attendance of the shareholders or their authorized representatives for the purpose of discussing and voting on issues of the agenda, provided that if a ballot is mailed to shareholders for participation at a meeting convened in such form, the shareholders may complete and mail the ballot back to the company without personally attending the meeting. A general meeting of the shareholders 137 by absentee ballot contemplates the determination of collecting shareholders' opinions on issues of the agenda by means of a written poll. The following issues cannot be decided by a shareholders' meeting by absentee ballot: election of the members of the board of directors; election of the review commission; approval of a company's independent auditor; and approval of the annual report, the annual financial statements, including balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and any distribution of profits, including approval of annual dividends and losses, if any. Notice and Participation All shareholders entitled to participate in a general shareholders' meeting must be notified of the meeting, whether the meeting is to be held in the form of a meeting or by absentee ballot, no less than 30 days prior to the date of the meeting, and such notification shall specify the agenda for the meeting. However, if it is an extraordinary shareholders' meeting to elect the board of directors, shareholders must be notified at least 70 days prior to the date of the meeting. Only those items that were set out in the agenda to shareholders may be voted upon at a general shareholders' meeting. If a nominal holder of the shares registers in the register of shareholders, then a notification of the shareholders' meeting shall be sent to the nominal holder. The nominal holder must notify its clients in accordance with Russian legislation or an agreement with the client. The list of shareholders entitled to participate in a general shareholders' meeting is to be compiled on the basis of data in our shareholders register on the date established by the board of directors, which date may neither be earlier than the date of adoption of the board resolution to hold a general shareholders' meeting nor more than 50 days before the date of the meeting (or, in the case of an extraordinary shareholders' meeting to elect the board of directors, not later than 85 days before the date of the meeting). The right to participate in a general meeting of shareholders may be exercised by a shareholder as follows: by personally participating in the discussion of agenda items and voting thereon; by sending an authorized representative to participate in the discussion of agenda items and to vote thereon; by submitting a written ballot reflecting the shareholders' voting on the agenda items; or by delegating the right to submit such written ballot to an authorized representative. Board of Directors Our charter provides that our entire board of directors is up for election at each annual general shareholders' meeting. Our board of directors is elected through cumulative voting. Under cumulative voting, each shareholder may cast an aggregate number of votes equal to the number of shares held by such shareholder multiplied by the number of persons to be elected to our board of directors, and the shareholder may give all such votes to one candidate or spread them between two or more candidates. Before the expiration of their term, the directors may be removed as a group at any time without cause by a majority vote of a shareholders' meeting. 138 The Joint Stock Companies Law requires at least a five-member board of directors for all joint stock companies, at least a seven-member board of directors for a joint stock company with more than 1,000 holders of voting shares, and at least a nine-member board of directors for a joint stock company with more than 10,000 holders of voting shares. Only natural persons (as opposed to legal entities) are entitled to sit on the board. Members of the board of directors are not required to be shareholders of the company. The actual number of directors is determined by the company's charter or a decision of the shareholders' meeting. Our charter provides that our board of directors consists of at least seven members, which number may be increased pursuant to a decision of the general meeting of shareholders. Currently, our board of directors consists of seven members. The Joint Stock Companies Law prohibits a board of directors from acting on issues that fall within the exclusive competence of the general shareholders' meeting. Our board of directors has the power to perform the general management of the company, and to decide, among others, the following issues: determination of our business priorities; convening annual and extraordinary shareholders' meetings, except in certain circumstances specified in the Joint Stock Companies Law; approval of the agenda for the shareholders' meeting and determination of the record date for shareholders entitled to participate in a shareholders' meeting; placement of our bonds and other securities in cases specified in the Joint Stock Companies Law; determination of the price of our property and of our securities to be placed or repurchased, as provided for by the Joint Stock Companies Law; repurchase of our shares, bonds and other securities in certain cases provided for by the Joint Stock Companies Law; appointment and removal of our President; recommendations on the amount of the dividend and the payment procedure thereof; recommendations on the amount of remuneration and compensation to be paid to the members of our review commission and on the fees payable for the services of an independent auditor; the use of our reserve fund and other funds; approval of our internal documents, except for those documents whose approval falls within the competence of our shareholders or the president; the creation and liquidation of branches and representative offices; approval of major and interested party transactions in certain cases provided for by the Joint Stock Companies Law; increasing our charter capital by issuing additional shares within the limits of the authorized charter capital, except in certain circumstances specified in our charter; approval of our share registrar and the terms of the agreement with it; and other issues, as provided for by the Joint Stock Companies Law and our charter. Our charter generally requires a majority vote of the directors present for an action to pass, with the exception of actions for which Russian legislation requires a unanimous vote or a majority vote of the disinterested and independent directors, as described therein. A board meeting is considered duly assembled and legally competent to act when a majority of elected directors is present. 139 Our internal regulation "On the Board of Directors of OJSC Mobile TeleSystems" was approved by the annual shareholders' meeting on June 29, 2007. In accordance with clause 1.8 of the Regulation, the members of the board of directors have the right to: receive information regarding our operations; propose issues to be discussed by the board of directors; review the minutes of the board of directors meetings; express their own point of view during the board of directors meetings; request to include in the minutes of the meetings their personal opinion concerning issues on the agenda and decisions made with respect thereto; and receive a remuneration and/or compensation of expenses related to the execution of their duties as members of the board of directors in accordance with decisions of the general shareholders' meeting. In accordance with clause 1.9 of the Regulation, the members of the board of directors must: act in our interests; execute their duties in a confident and scrupulous manner; act within their rights and in accordance with the purposes of the board of directors; not distribute confidential information concerning us and protect such information from unlawful and improper use and publishing, and not use such confidential information in their own or third parties' commercial purposes; participate in the work of the board of directors; participate in the voting process during the board of directors meetings; complete the tasks assigned by the board of directors; evaluate the risks and consequences of the decisions made; inform us on a timely basis about their participation in the management of other companies and changes in such participation; restrain from voting on issues of personal interest; inform the board of directors about future deals in which they may have a personal interest; disclose information about the holding, disposal or acquisition of our shares and other securities; and restrain from actions, which could lead to a conflict between their personal and our interests. Interested Party Transactions Under the Joint Stock Companies Law, certain transactions defined as "interested party transactions" require approval by disinterested directors or shareholders of the company. "Interested party transactions" include transactions involving a member of the board of directors or member of any executive body of the company (including the company's chief executive office and/or the company's managing organization), any person that owns, together with any affiliates, at least 20% of a company's issued voting shares or any person who is able to direct the actions of the company, if that person 140 and/or that person's spouse, parents, children, adoptive parents or children, brothers or sisters or affiliates, is/are: a party to, or beneficiary of, a transaction with the company, whether directly or as a representative or intermediary; the owner of at least 20% of the issued shares of a legal entity that is a party to, or beneficiary of, a transaction with the company, whether directly or as a representative or intermediary; or a member of the board of directors or a member of any management body of a company that is a party to, or beneficiary of, a transaction with the company, whether directly or as a representative or intermediary, or a member of the board of directors or of any management body of a management organization of such a company. The Joint Stock Companies Law requires that an interested party transaction by a company with more than 1,000 shareholders be approved by a majority vote of the independent directors of the company who are not interested in the transaction. For purposes of this rule, an "independent director" is a person who is not, and within the year preceding the decision to approve the transaction was not, a general director/president, a member of any executive body or an affiliate of the company, or a member of the board of directors or any management body of the company's management organization. Additionally, such person's spouse, parents, children, adoptive parents or children, brothers or sisters may not, and within the year preceding the date of the decision to approve the transaction did not, occupy positions in the executive bodies of the company or positions on the board of directors or of any management body of the company's management organization. For companies with 1,000 or fewer shareholders, an interested party transaction must be adopted by a majority vote of the directors who are not interested in the transaction if the number of these directors is sufficient to constitute a quorum. Approval by a majority of shareholders who are not interested in the transaction is required if: the value of such transaction or a number of interrelated transactions is 2% or more of the balance sheet value of the company's assets determined under Russian accounting standards; the transaction or a number of interrelated transactions involves the issuance, by subscription, of voting shares or securities convertible into voting shares, or a secondary market sale of such securities, in an amount exceeding 2% of the company's issued voting stock; the number of directors who are not interested in the transaction is not sufficient to constitute a quorum; or all the members of the board of directors of the company are interested parties, or none of them is an independent director. Approval by a majority of shareholders who are not interested in the transaction may not be required, until the next annual shareholders' meeting, for an interested party transaction if such transaction is substantially similar to transactions concluded by the company and the interested party in the ordinary course of business before such party became an interested party with respect to the transaction. The approval of interested party transactions is not required in the following instances: the company has only one shareholder that simultaneously performs the functions of the executive body of the company; all shareholders of the company are deemed interested in such transactions; the transactions arise from the shareholders executing their preemptive rights to purchase newly issued shares of the company; 141 the transactions arise from the repurchase, whether mandatory or not, by the company of its issued shares; the company merges with another company, and the latter owns more than three-fourths of the voting capital stock of the company; or the transactions that are mandatory for the company pursuant to Russian law and must be concluded on the basis of fixed prices and tariffs adopted by a competent state body. Major Transactions The Joint Stock Companies Law defines a "major transaction" as a transaction, or a number of interrelated transactions, involving the acquisition or disposal, or a possibility of disposal (whether directly or indirectly) of property having a value of 25% or more of the balance sheet value of the assets of a company determined under Russian accounting standards, with the exception of transactions conducted in the ordinary course of business or transactions involving the placement of common stock, or securities convertible into common stock. Major transactions involving assets having a value ranging from 25% to 50% of the balance sheet value of the assets of a company require unanimous approval by all members of the board of directors or, failing to receive such approval, a simple majority vote of a shareholders' meeting. Major transactions involving assets having a value in excess of 50% of the balance sheet value of the assets of a company require a three-quarters majority vote of a shareholders' meeting. Change in Control Anti-takeover Protection Russian legislation requires the following: A person intending to acquire 30% or more of an open joint stock company's ordinary shares and voting preferred shares (including, for such purposes, shares already owned by such person and its affiliates), will be entitled to make a public tender offer to other holders of such shares or securities convertible into such shares. A person that has acquired 30% or more of the totality of an open joint-stock company's ordinary shares and voting preferred shares (including, for such purposes, shares already owned by such person and its affiliates, but excluding shares that were acquired pursuant to previous voluntary or mandatory offers) will generally be required to make, within 35 days of acquiring such shares, a public tender offer for other shares of the same class and for securities convertible into such shares, at the price which is not less than the price determined based on a weighted market price of the shares, or on a price supplied by an independent appraiser if the shares have no or insufficient trading history. From the moment of acquisition of 30% or more of the shares until the moment of delivery of an offer to the security holders, the person making an offer and its affiliates will be able to register for quorum and vote only 30% of the shares of the company (regardless of the size of their actual holdings). These rules are also applied (or reapplied) to acquisitions resulting in a person or a group of persons owning more than 50% and 75% of a company's outstanding shares. A person that as a result of such an offer becomes (individually or with its affiliates) the owner of more than 95% of the company's ordinary shares and voting preferred shares, must buy out the remaining shares of the company as well as other securities convertible into such shares upon request of the holders of such shares or other securities, and may require such holders to sell such shares and other securities, at a price based on the prices of the preceding acquisition by the offeror. 142 An offer of the kind described in either of the preceding three paragraphs must be accompanied by a bank guarantee of payment. If the company is publicly traded, prior notice of the offer must be filed with the FSFM; otherwise, notice must be filed with the FSFM no later than the date of the offer. The FSFM may order amendments to the terms of the offer (including price) in order to bring them into compliance with the rules. Once such an offer has been made, competing offers for the same securities can be made by third parties and, in certain circumstances, acceptance of the initial offer may be withdrawn by the security holders who choose to accept such competing offer. From the making of such an offer until 20 days after its expiry (which period may in certain cases exceed 100 days) the company's shareholders' meeting will have the sole power to make decisions on charter capital increase, issuance of securities, approval of certain major transactions, and on certain other significant matters. The above rules may be supplemented through FSFM rulemaking, which may result in a wider, narrower or more specific interpretation of these rules by the government and judicial authorities, as well as by market participants. Approval of the Federal Antimonopoly Service Pursuant to the Federal Law on Competition, the Federal Antimonopoly Service must approve in advance acquisitions of voting capital stock of a joint stock company involving (1) companies with a combined value of assets or combined annual revenues under Russian Accounting Standards exceeding a certain threshold, or (2) companies registered as having more than a 35% share of a certain commodity market, and which would result in a shareholder (or a group of affiliated shareholders) holding more than 25%, 50% or 75% of the voting capital stock of such company, or in a transfer between such companies of assets or rights to assets, the value of which exceeds a certain amount. Disclosure of Ownership Effective July 1, 2006, a holder of our common shares is required to publicly disclose an acquisition of 5% or more of the outstanding common shares of the company, as well any change in the amount of common shares held by such holder, if as a result of such change the percentage of common shares held by the holder becomes greater or lesser than 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 50% or 75% of the outstanding common shares of the company. Notification of Foreign Ownership Foreign persons registered as individual entrepreneurs in Russia who acquire shares in a Russian joint stock company and foreign companies that acquire shares in a Russian joint stock company may need to notify the Russian tax authorities within one month following such acquisition. However, the procedure for notifying the Russian tax authorities by foreign companies that are not registered with such tax authorities at the time of their share acquisition remains unclear. C. Material Contracts The following is a description of contracts that we and/or our subsidiaries are a party to and that are or may be material to our business: Syndicated Loans and Credit Facilities On April 21, 2006, we signed a syndicated loan facility with several international financial institutions, including: The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Bayerische Landesbank, HSBC Bank plc, ING Bank N.V., Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich AG, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking 143 Corporation Europe Limited.

Notes Indentures and Guarantees We completed a $400.0 million notes offering through Mobile TeleSystems Finance S.A. on January 30, 2003. The 9.75% notes were issued under an indenture dated January 30, 2003. These notes were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us and matured on January 30, 2008. Interest on the notes was payable in arrears on January 30 and July 30 of each year, commencing on July 30, 2003. The net proceeds from this offering of $396.1 million were used for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of 57.7% and 26.0% stakes in UMC in March and June 2003, respectively, and other acquisitions of mobile operators in Russia. The notes were listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. These notes were fully paid in January 2008. We completed a $400.0 million notes offering through Mobile TeleSystems Finance S.A. on October 14, 2003. The 8.375% notes were issued under an indenture dated October 14, 2003. Interest on the notes is payable in arrears on April 14 and October 14 of each year, commencing on April 14, 145 2003. These notes are guaranteed by us and mature on October 14, 2010. They are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The net proceeds from this offering of $395.4 million were used for general corporate purposes, including dividend payments, capital expenditures and repayment of existing indebtedness incurred in connection with our acquisitions of mobile operators in Russia and Ukraine. We completed a $400.0 million notes offering through Mobile TeleSystems Finance S.A. on January 28, 2005. The 8.00% notes were issued under an indenture dated January 28, 2005. Interest on the notes is payable in arrears on January 28 and July 28 of each year, commencing on July 28, 2005. These notes are guaranteed by us and mature on January 28, 2012. They are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The net proceeds from this offering of $398.9 million were used to repay a $140 million loan we received from Credit Suisse First Boston International in October 2004 for general corporate purposes. We used the remaining net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and increasing our interests in certain of our subsidiaries. Each of the indentures sets forth various occurrences, each of which would constitute an event of default. If an event of default, other than an event of default arising from events of bankruptcy, insolvency or bankruptcy-related reorganization, occurs and is continuing, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding notes may accelerate the maturity of all of the notes. After acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes may, under circumstances set forth in the indenture, rescind the acceleration if all events of default, other than the nonpayment of principal of the notes which have become due solely because of the acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in the indenture. If an event of default arising from events of our bankruptcy, insolvency or bankruptcy-related reorganization occurs and is continuing, then the principal of, and accrued interest on, all of the notes will automatically become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the holders of notes or the trustee. Each of the indentures contains covenants limiting: (a) the ability of the issuer, us and our subsidiaries to incur debt; (b) the ability of the issuer, us and our subsidiaries to create liens; (c) the ability of the issuer, us and our subsidiaries to lease properties sold or transferred by us; (d) our ability to enter into loan facilities with affiliates; (e) our ability to merge or consolidate with another person or convey our properties and assets to another person; and (f) our ability to sell or transfer any of our or our subsidiaries' GSM licenses for the Moscow and St. Petersburg license areas, the GSM license for the Krasnodar license area, and UMC's licenses for Ukraine. In addition, if we experience certain types of mergers, consolidations or other changes in control, noteholders will have the right to require us to redeem the notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest. We are also required to take all commercially reasonable steps necessary to maintain a rating of the notes from Moody's or Standard & Poor's. The notes also have cross default provisions with publicly traded debt issued by Sistema. If we fail to meet these covenants, after certain notice and cure periods, the noteholders can accelerate the debt to be immediately due and payable. We believe that we are in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants provisions during the three-year period ended December 31, 2007. Pursuant to the guarantees contained in each indenture, we fully and unconditionally guaranteed all payments of principal and interest on the notes. These guarantees are our general unsecured obligation, senior to all our existing and future subordinated obligations, equal to all our existing and future unsecured obligations, and effectively junior to all our existing and future secured obligations and all existing and future obligations of our subsidiaries. 146 D. Exchange Controls The Federal Law on Currency Regulation and Currency Control which came into effect on June 18, 2004, sets forth certain restrictions on settlements between residents of Russia with respect to operations involving foreign securities (including GDRs), including requirements for settlement in Russian rubles. Repatriation of Export Proceeds Russian companies must repatriate 100% of their receivables from the export of goods and services (with a limited number of exceptions concerning, in particular, certain types of secured financing). Restrictions on the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to non-residents The Federal Law on Foreign Investments in the Russian Federation of July 9, 1999, specifically guarantees foreign investors the right to repatriate their earnings from Russian investments. However, the evolving Russian exchange control regime may materially affect your ability to do so. Currently, ruble dividends on common shares may be converted into U.S. dollars without restriction. However, the ability to convert rubles into U.S. dollars is also subject to the availability of U.S. dollars in Russia's currency markets. Although there is an existing market within Russia for the conversion of rubles into U.S. dollars, including the interbank currency exchange and over-the-counter and currency futures markets, the further development of this market is uncertain. E. Taxation The following discussion describes the material United States federal and Russian income and withholding tax consequences to you if you are a U.S. holder (generally, a "United States person," as the term is defined in the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) of common stock or ADSs and a resident of the United States for purposes of the United States-Russia income tax treaty and are fully eligible for benefits under the United States-Russia income tax treaty. Subject to certain provisions of the United States-Russia income tax treaty relating to limitations on benefits, a U.S. resident under the treaty is generally defined as a person liable, under the laws of the United States, to U.S. tax (other than taxes in respect only of income from sources in the United States or capital situated therein) by reason of your domicile, residence, citizenship, place of incorporation, or any other similar criterion (and, for income derived by a partnership, trust or estate, residence is determined in accordance with the residence of the person liable to tax with respect to such income). The treaty also provides for a procedure to resolve matters where a resident of the United States qualifies as a Russian tax resident under Russian domestic rules. For individuals, a non-resident means a physical person who holds securities and is actually present in the Russian Federation for less than 183 days (excluding days of arrival to Russia, but including days of departure from Russia) in any 12-month rolling period. Presence in Russia is not interrupted if an individual departs for short periods (less than six months) for the purpose of medical treatment or education. The benefits under the United States-Russia income tax treaty discussed in this document generally are not available to U.S. persons who hold ADSs or common stock in connection with the conduct of a business in the Russian Federation through a permanent establishment as defined in the United States-Russia income tax treaty. Subject to certain exceptions, a U.S. person's permanent establishment under the United States-Russia income tax treaty is a fixed place of business through which such person carries on business activities in the Russian Federation (generally including, but not limited to, a place of management, a branch, an office and a factory). Under certain circumstances, a U.S. person may be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the Russian Federation as a result of activities carried 147 on in the Russian Federation through agents of the U.S. person. This summary does not address the treatment of holders described in this paragraph. The following discussion is based on: the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof; Russian legislation; and the United States-Russia income tax treaty (and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof); all as in effect on the date of this document. All of the foregoing is subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, after the date of this document. This discussion is also based, in part, on representations of the depositary, and assumes that each obligation in the deposit agreement and any related agreements will be performed in accordance with its terms. The discussion with respect to Russian legislation is based on our understanding of current Russian law and Russian tax rules, which are subject to frequent change and varying interpretations. We believe, and the following discussion assumes, that for United States federal income tax purposes, we were not a passive foreign investment company for the taxable year ending in 2007, we will not be a passive foreign investment company for the current taxable year and we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future. However, passive foreign investment company determinations are made annually and may involve facts that are not within our control. If we were to be a passive foreign investment company, materially adverse tax consequences could apply to investors who are "United States persons" as defined in the Code. The following discussion is not intended as tax advice to any particular investor. It is also not a complete analysis or listing of all potential United States federal or Russian income and withholding tax consequences to you of ownership of common stock or ADSs. We urge you to consult your own tax adviser regarding the specific United States federal, state, and local and Russian tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the common stock or ADSs under your own particular factual circumstances. Russian Income and Withholding Tax Consequences The Russian tax rules applicable to U.S. holders are characterized by significant uncertainties and limited interpretive guidance. Russian tax authorities have provided limited guidance regarding the treatment of ADS arrangements, and there can be no certainty as to how the Russian tax authorities will ultimately treat those arrangements. In 2005, the Russian Ministry of Finance stated that ADS holders must be treated as the beneficial owners of the underlying shares for purposes of the double tax treaty provisions applicable to taxation of dividend income from the underlying shares. However, double tax treaty relief is available only if the tax treaty residence of the holder is duly confirmed. It is currently unclear whether depositories will be willing or able to provide residency certificates for ADS holders or implement procedures for holders to benefit from applicable tax treaties. Thus, while a U.S. holder may technically be entitled to benefit from the provisions of the United States-Russia income tax treaty, in practice such relief may be difficult or impossible to obtain. However, if the Russian tax authorities were not to treat U.S. holders as the beneficial owners of the underlying shares, then the benefits discussed below regarding the United States-Russia income tax treaty would not be available to U.S. holders. Russian tax law and procedures are also not well developed, and local tax inspectors have considerable autonomy and often interpret tax rules without regard to the rule of law. Both the substantive provisions of Russian tax law and the interpretation and 148 application of those provisions by the Russian tax authorities may be subject to more rapid and unpredictable change than in jurisdictions with more developed capital markets. Taxation of Dividends Dividends paid to U.S. holders generally will be subject to Russian withholding tax at a 15% rate. The tax burden may be reduced to 5% to 10% under the United States-Russia income tax treaty for U.S. holders; a 5% rate applies for U.S. holders who are legal entities owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares, and a 10% rate applies to dividends paid to U.S. holders, including individuals and legal entities owning less than 10% of the company's outstanding shares. See "United States-Russia Income Tax Treaty Procedures." Notwithstanding the foregoing, treaty relief may not be available to non-resident holders of ADSs. In 2005 and 2006, the Ministry of Finance expressed an opinion that ADS holders (rather than the depositary) should be treated as the beneficial owners of dividends for the purposes of the double tax treaty provisions applicable to taxation of dividend income from the underlying ordinary shares, provided that the tax residencies of the ADS holders are duly confirmed. However, in the absence of any specific provisions in the Russian tax legislation with respect to the concept of tax treaty beneficial ownership and taxation of income of beneficial owners, it is unclear how the Russian tax authorities and courts would ultimately treat the ADS holders in this regard. Moreover, from a practical perspective, it may not be possible for the depositary to collect residence confirmations from all ADS holders and submit such information to us and, in addition, we may be unaware of the exact amount of income payable to each holder. Therefore, with respect to legal entities or organizations who are U.S. holders, we may be obligated to withhold income tax at the rate of 15% from dividend payments made to the depositary, unless prior to making such dividend payments to the depositary, we are provided with confirmation that U.S. holders are beneficial owners of dividends within the meaning of the United States-Russia income tax treaty and all administrative requirements for claiming treaty benefits are met. Although non-resident holders of ADSs may apply for a refund of a portion of the tax withheld under an applicable tax treaty, the procedure to do so may be time consuming and no assurance can be given that the Russian tax authorities will grant a refund. See "United States-Russia Income Tax Treaty Procedures." With respect to individuals who are U.S. holders of ADSs, we may also be obligated to withhold income tax at the rate of 15% from dividend payments made to the depositary. Where withholding of personal income tax is not performed, individuals who are U.S. holders of ADSs will then be required to submit an annual personal tax return to the Russian tax authorities and pay Russian income tax at the rate of 15%. When submitting the tax return, individuals who are U.S. holders may claim an application of the reduced rates of withholding tax established by the relevant treaty, provided that the procedures described in "United States-Russia Income Tax Treaty Procedures" are complied with. Obtaining the respective approvals from the tax authorities may be time-consuming and burdensome. If the appropriate documentation has not been provided to us before the dividend payment date, we are required to withhold tax at the full rate, and U.S. holders qualifying for a reduced rate under the United States-Russia income tax treaty then would be required to file claims for refund within three years with the Russian tax authorities. For individuals claiming treaty relief, the documents substantiating the right for treaty benefits should be submitted to the Russian tax authorities within one year after the end of the year to which these benefits relate. In practice, where withholding is performed, the tax authorities may refuse to refund or credit the 15% tax withheld from payment of dividends to the depositary and, therefore, it is possible that individuals who are U.S. holders may be subject to up to a 30% effective tax rate on their share of dividends. 149 Taxation of Capital Gains U.S. holders generally should not be subject to any Russian income or withholding taxes in connection with the sale, exchange, or other disposition of ADSs or common stock outside of Russia if the shares or ADSs are not sold to a Russian resident. Sales or other dispositions of ADSs or common stock to Russian residents, however, may be subject to Russian income or withholding taxes, and for such a sale by a U.S. holder, the Russian resident purchaser may be required to withhold 20% to 30% of any gain realized on the sale (20% of gross proceeds or 24% of gross proceeds less expenses incurred for legal entities, and 30% of gross proceeds less expenses incurred for individuals). However, there is no mechanism by which a Russian purchaser would be able to effect this withholding upon purchasing ADSs from a U.S. holder in connection with the sale of ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange. Non-residents who are individuals are taxable on Russian-source income. Provided that gains arising from the disposition of the foregoing types of securities and derivatives outside of Russia by U.S. holders who are individuals not resident in Russia for tax purposes will not be considered Russian source income, such income should not be taxable in Russia. The Russian tax laws do not give clear indication as to how the sale of ADSs should be sourced for individuals, other than that income from the sale of securities "in Russia" should be considered as Russian source income. As there is no further definition of what should be considered to be a sale "in Russia," the Russian tax authorities have a certain amount of freedom to conclude what transactions take place in or outside Russia, including looking at the place of the transaction, the place of the issuer of the shares or other similar criteria. Therefore, gains arising from the disposition of the same securities and derivatives in Russia by U.S. holders who are individuals not resident in Russia for tax purposes may be subject to tax either at the source in Russia or based on an annual tax return, which they may be required to submit to the Russian tax authorities. U.S. holders may be able to claim the benefits of a reduced rate of withholding under the United States-Russia income tax treaty on the disposition of shares of common stock or ADSs to Russian residents, or obtain a refund of any withheld amounts at rates different from provided in the treaty, by relying on the United States-Russia income tax treaty and complying with the appropriate procedures described below. Regardless of the residence of the purchaser, a U.S. holder should not be subject to any Russian income or withholding taxes in connection with the sale, exchange, or other disposition of ADSs if immovable property situated in Russia constitutes 50% or less of our assets or if ADSs are sold via foreign exchanges where they are legally circulated. United States-Russia Income Tax Treaty Procedures Under current rules, to claim the benefit of a reduced rate of withholding under the United States-Russia income tax treaty, a non-resident generally must provide official certification from the U.S. tax authorities of eligibility for the treaty benefits in the manner required by Russian law. A U.S. holder may obtain the appropriate certification by mailing completed forms, together with the holder's name, taxpayer identification number, the tax period for which certification is required, and other applicable information, to the United States Internal Revenue Service. The procedures for obtaining certification are described in greater detail in the instructions to Internal Revenue Service Form 8802. As obtaining the required certification from the Internal Revenue Service may take at least six to eight weeks, U.S. holders should apply for such certification as soon as possible. For individuals, advance relief from withholding taxes will generally be impossible as it is very unlikely that the supporting documentation for the treaty relief can be provided to the tax authorities and approval from the latter obtained before the payment takes place. 150 Self-assessment of treaty relief is not allowed in Russia. Therefore, in order to apply for a treaty relief, personal tax return, an application with supporting documents, should be submitted to the Russian tax authorities. In practice, application of double tax treaty provisions may be time consuming and burdensome as the Russian tax authorities may require many additional documents. Accordingly, the application of the Russian double tax treaty relief may be further aggravated by the difficulties resulting from the lack of a direct documentary link between income received by the individual from the depositary and the tax withheld by us on dividend distributions. If tax is withheld by a Russian resident on dividends or other amounts at a rate different from provided in the tax treaty, a U.S. holder may apply for a tax refund by filing a package of documents with the Russian local tax inspectorate to which the withholding tax was remitted within three years from the withholding date for U.S. holders which are legal entities, and within one year from the end of the year in which the withholding occurred for individual U.S. holders. The package should include the application (for legal entitiesform 1011DT (2002) for non-dividend income and 1012DT (2002) for dividend income, for individualsa free form), confirmations of residence of the foreign holder (IRS Form 6166), a copy of the agreement or other documents substantiating the payment of income, documents confirming the beneficial ownership of the dividends recipient and the transfer of tax to the budget. Under the provisions of the Tax Code, the refund of the tax should be effected within one month after the submission of the documents. However, procedures for processing such claims have not been clearly established, and there is significant uncertainty regarding the availability and timing of such refunds. Neither the depositary nor us has or will have any obligation to assist an ADS holder with the completion and filing of any tax forms. United States Federal Income Tax Consequences The following is a general description of the material United States federal income tax consequences that apply to you if you are, for United States federal income tax purposes, a beneficial owner of ADSs or common stock who is a citizen or resident of the United States, a corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. tax regardless of its source, or a trust, if a United States court can exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons can control all substantial trust decisions, or if the trust was in existence on August 20, 1996 and has properly elected to continue to be treated as a United States person. If a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of ADSs or common stock, the United States federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Since your United States federal income and withholding tax treatment may vary depending upon your particular situation, you may be subject to special rules not discussed below. Special rules will apply, for example, if you are: an insurance company; a tax-exempt organization; a financial institution; a person subject to the alternative minimum tax; a person who is a broker-dealer in securities; an S corporation; an expatriate subject to Section 877 of the Code; 151 an owner of, directly, indirectly or by attribution, 10% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock; or an owner holding ADSs or common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, synthetic security or conversion transaction. In addition, this summary is generally limited to persons holding common stock or ADSs as "capital assets" within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code and whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar. The discussion below also does not address the effect of any United States state or local tax law or foreign tax law. For purposes of applying United States federal income and withholding tax law, a holder of an ADS should be treated as the owner of the underlying shares of common stock represented by that ADS. The United States Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom ADSs are pre-released may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming, by United States persons holding ADSs, of foreign tax credits for United States federal income tax purposes. Such actions would also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced rate of tax applicable to dividends received by certain non-corporate United States persons, as described below. Accordingly, the analysis of the creditability of Russian taxes described below, and the availability of the reduced tax rate for dividends received by certain non-corporate United States persons, could be affected by future actions that may be taken by the United States Treasury. Taxation of Dividends on Common Stock or ADSs For United States federal income tax purposes, the gross amount of a distribution, including any Russian withholding taxes, with respect to common stock or ADSs will be treated as a taxable dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, computed in accordance with United States federal income tax principles. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011, if you are a non-corporate taxpayer such dividends may be taxed at the lower applicable capital gains rate provided (1) certain holding period requirements are satisfied, (2) either (a) our ADSs continue to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (or other national securities exchange that is registered under section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Nasdaq Stock Market) or (b) we are eligible for the benefits of the United States-Russia income tax treaty, and (3) we are not, for the taxable year in which the dividend was paid, or in the preceding taxable year, a "passive foreign investment company." Non-corporate U.S. holders are strongly urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the applicability of the lower capital gains rate to dividends received with respect to ADSs or shares of common stock. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will be applied against and will reduce your tax basis in common stock or ADSs and, to the extent in excess of such tax basis, will be treated as gain from a sale or exchange of such common stock or ADSs. You should be aware that we do not intend to calculate our earnings and profits for United States federal income tax purposes and, unless we make such calculations, you should assume that any distributions with respect to common stock or ADSs generally will be treated as a dividend, even if that distribution would otherwise be treated as a return of capital or as capital gain pursuant to the rules described above. If you are a corporation, you will not be allowed a deduction for dividends received in respect of distributions on common stock or ADSs, which is generally available for dividends paid by U.S. corporations. If a dividend distribution is paid in rubles, the amount includible in income will be the U.S. dollar value of the dividend, calculated using the exchange rate in effect on the date the dividend is includible in income by you, regardless of whether the payment is actually converted into U.S. dollars. Any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations during the period from the date the dividend is includible in your income to the date the rubles are converted into U.S. dollars will be treated as 152 ordinary income or loss. You may be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss on the receipt of a refund of Russian withholding tax pursuant to the United States-Russia income tax treaty to the extent the United States dollar value of the refund differs from the dollar equivalent of that amount on the date of receipt of the underlying dividend. Russian withholding tax at the rate applicable to you under the United States-Russia income tax treaty should be treated as a foreign income tax that, subject to generally applicable limitations and conditions, is eligible for credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability or, at your election, may be deducted in computing taxable income. If, however, the holder of an ADS is not treated as the owner of the underlying common stock represented by the ADS for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then Russian withholding tax would not be treated as a foreign income tax eligible for credit as described in the preceding sentence. If Russian tax is withheld at a rate in excess of the rate applicable to you under the United States-Russia income tax treaty, you may not be entitled to credits for the excess amount, even though the procedures for claiming refunds and the practical likelihood that refunds will be made available in a timely fashion are uncertain. For United States foreign tax credit purposes, a dividend distribution will be treated as "passive category income" but could, in the case of certain U.S. holders, constitute "general category income." The rules relating to the determination of the foreign tax credit, or deduction in lieu of the foreign tax credit, are complex and you should consult your own tax advisors with respect to those rules. Taxation on Sale or Exchange of Common Stock or ADSs The sale of common stock or ADSs will generally result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale and your adjusted basis in such common stock or ADSs. That gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common stock or ADSs are capital assets in your hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the common stock or ADSs have been held for more than one year. If you are an individual, such realized long-term capital gain is generally subject to a reduced rate of United States federal income tax. Limitations may apply to your ability to offset capital losses against ordinary income. Deposits and withdrawals of common stock by you in exchange for ADSs will not result in the realization of gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Gain realized on the sale of common stock or ADSs will generally be treated as U.S. source income and therefore the use of foreign tax credits relating to any Russian taxes imposed upon such sale may be limited. You are strongly urged to consult your own tax advisors as to the availability of tax credits for any Russian taxes withheld on the sale of common stock or ADSs. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Dividends and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of common stock or ADSs that are paid in the United States or by a U.S.-related financial intermediary will be subject to U.S. information reporting rules and U.S. backup withholding tax, unless you are a corporation or other exempt recipient. In addition, you will not be subject to backup withholding if you provide your taxpayer identification number and certify that no loss of exemption from backup withholding has occurred. Holders that are not U.S. persons generally are not subject to information reporting or backup withholding, but such holders may be required to provide certification as to their non-U.S. status. F.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Foreign exchange risks exist to the extent our revenues, costs and debt obligation are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in the countries of our operations. We are subject to market risk deriving from changes in interest rates, which may affect the cost of our financing. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to variability in cash flow risk related to our variable interest rate debt and exposed to fair value risk related to our fixed-rate notes. As of December 31, 2007, $2,196.5 million, or 64.6% of our total indebtedness, including capital leases, was variable interest rate debt, while $1,205.2 million, or 35.4% of our total indebtedness, including capital leases, was fixed interest rate debt. The table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates for indebtedness by contractual maturity dates as of December 31, 2007. 154 Contractual Maturity Date as of December 31, 2007 Variable debt Currency 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Annual interest rate (Actual interest rate at December 31, 2007) (amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars) ING Bank N.V., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Bayerische Landesbank, HSBC, Raiffeisen, Sumitomo USD $  $ 630,000 $  $  $  $  $ 630,000 5.40 % ING Bank N.V., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Bayerische Landesbank, HSBC, Raiffeisen, Sumitomo USD 161,538 215,385 215,385 107,692   700,000 5.60 % Citibank International plc and ING Bank N.V USD 19,741 19,741 19,741 19,741 19,741 31,762 130,467 4.90 % HSBC Bank plc and ING BHFBANK AG USD 21,801 21,801 21,801 21,801 21,801 19,180 128,185 5.02 % EBRD USD 18,462 18,462 18,462 18,462 18,462 27,690 120,000 7.70 % Commerzbank AG, ING Bank AG and HSBC Bank plc USD 14,790 14,790 14,790 14,790 14,790 29,583 103,533 4.90 % HSBC Bank plc, ING Bank AG and Bayerische Landesbank USD 15,472 15,472 15,472 15,472 15,472 23,207 100,567 4.90 % EBRD USD 14,872 14,872 14,872 14,872 14,872 22,306 96,666 6.11 % Barclays bank plc USD 10,306 10,306 10,306 10,306 10,306 15,458 68,988 4.73 % ABN AMRO N.V.

We would have experienced an additional interest expense of approximately $18.7 million on an annual basis as a result of a hypothetical increase in the LIBOR/EURIBOR by 1% over the current rate as of December 31, 2006. The decrease by 19.3% in an additional interest expense is primarily attributable to the LIBOR/EURIBOR fluctuations and change in our debt structure during the year ended December 31, 2007. The fair value of our publicly traded fixed-rate long-term notes as of December 31, 2007, ranged from 100.0% to 103.8% of the notional amount. As of December 31, 2007, the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of other fixed rate debt, including capital lease obligations, was immaterial. For details of our fixed-rate debt, refer to Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements. The fair value of variable rate debt approximates its carrying value. 155 We use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates. We primarily focus on reducing risk caused by the fluctuations in interest rates for our variable-rate long-term debt. According to our policy, we entered into several interest rate swap agreements for long-term debt with maturity of more than 3 years. The swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and the hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting. The table below presents a summary of our interest rate swap agreements. Type of derivative Period Notional amount Mark to Market Value as of December 31, 2007 (amounts in millions of U.S. dollars) Interest Rate Swap Agreements Swap agreement with HSBC Bank Plc to pay a fixed rate of 3.29% and receive a variable interest rate of EURIBOR April 28, 2006 to October 29, 2013 38.1 1.1 Swap agreement with HSBC Bank Plc to pay a fixed rate of 4.14% and receive a variable interest rate of LIBOR March 31, 2008 to September 30, 2014 96.1 (0.2 ) Swap agreement with Rabobank to pay a fixed rate of 4.16% and receive a variable interest rate of LIBOR April 9, 2008 to April 9, 2014 86.1 (0.2 ) Swap agreement with Citibank N.A. to pay fixed rate of 4.29% and receive a variable interest rate of LIBOR September 28, 2007 to September 30, 2013 53.5 (0.2 ) Swap agreement with ING Bank N.V. to pay fixed rate of 4.19% and receive a variable interest rate of LIBOR February 29, 2008 to February 28, 2014 92.6 (0.5 ) Swap agreement with ING Bank N.V. to pay fixed rate of 4.41% and receive a variable interest rate of LIBOR July 16, 2007 to January 15, 2014 67.0 (0.4 ) As of December 31, 2007, approximately 20% of our variable interest rate debt was hedged against interest rate risks. We continue to consider other financial instruments available to us to mitigate exposure to interest rate fluctuations. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 156 Foreign Currency Risk The following tables show, for the periods indicated, certain information regarding the exchange rate between the ruble and the U.S. dollar, based on data published by the Central Bank of Russia. These rates may differ from the actual rates used in preparation of our financial statements and other financial information provided herein.

The exchange rate between the ruble and the U.S. dollar quoted by the Central Bank of Russia for June 10, 2008 was 23.52 rubles per U.S. dollar. The following tables show, for the periods indicated, certain information regarding the exchange rate between the hryvnia and the U.S. dollar, based on data published by the National Bank of Ukraine.

The exchange rate between the hryvnia and the U.S. dollar quoted by the National Bank of Ukraine for June 10, 2008 was 4.85 hryvnias per U.S. dollar. Our principal exchange rate risk involves changes in the value of the U.S. dollar and euro relative to the Russian ruble, Ukrainian hryvnia, Uzbekistan som, Turkmenistan manat and Armenian dram. We have not entered into any significant currency hedging arrangements, but we continue to consider different financial instruments available to us in order to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. A significant part of our capital expenditures, borrowings and certain operating costs (roaming expenses, cost of customer equipment and other) are either denominated in U.S. dollars or tightly linked to the U.S. dollar exchange rate. In order to hedge against a risk of exchange rate currency fluctuations, we previously denominated a majority of our tariffs in Russia, which are payable in rubles, in "conventional" units linked to the U.S. dollar and required accounts to be settled at the official exchange rate of the Central Bank of Russia on the date of payment. However, in the middle of 2006, we introduced a fixed exchange rate for converting U.S. dollar-denominated tariffs and charges into Russian rubles in order to address anticipated regulatory changes and competitive pressures on the Russian market and starting from January 1, 2007, moved to ruble-denominated tariffs and invoicing. As a result of these changes, we reevaluated the functional currency criteria under SFAS No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation," and determined that, beginning January 1, 2007, the functional currency of our subsidiaries domiciled in Russia was the ruble. For more information, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements. The change was adopted prospectively beginning January 1, 2007 in accordance with SFAS No. 52. No restatement of comparative amounts will be made for the change in functional currency. Consequently, currency exchange gains and losses in Russia were the result of operations denominated in currencies other than the ruble in 2007, and will continue to be so in future years, assuming the ruble remains our functional currency. During 2006, the U.S. dollar was our functional currency and, therefore, currency exchange gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were the result of operations involving currencies other than the U.S. dollar. If either of the ruble, hryvnia, som, manat or dram declines against the U.S. dollar and tariffs cannot be maintained for competitive or other reasons, our revenues and operating margins could be adversely affected and we could have difficulty repaying or refinancing our U.S. dollar-denominated indebtedness. Our U.S. dollar-denominated debt represents our primary future risk of exchange loss in U.S. dollar terms. If the value of the ruble, hryvnia, som, manat or dram declines, our net ruble, hryvnia, som, manat or dram monetary asset position results in currency remeasurement losses as the amount of these currencies required to repay U.S. dollar-denominated debt increases. A portion of our capital expenditures, borrowings and certain operating costs (roaming expenses, costs of customer equipment and other) are denominated in euros. We currently do not hedge against 158 the risk of decline in the ruble, hryvnia, som, manat or dram against the euro because settlements denominated in euros are not significant. We would experience a currency exchange loss of $313.5 million on our U.S. dollar-denominated net monetary liabilities as a result of a hypothetical 10.0% increase in the ruble/hryvnia/som/manat/dram to U.S. dollar exchange rate at December 31, 2007. The large increase in a hypothetical currency remeasurement loss resulted from a change in our functional currency from the U.S. dollar to the ruble in 2007 (i.e. in 2007, a currency exchange loss would be generated by dollar-denominated net monetary liabilities while, in 2006, it would have been generated by ruble/hryvnia-denominated net monetary assets). We would experience a currency exchange loss of $3.3 million in the fair value of our euro-denominated net monetary liabilities as a result of a hypothetical 10.0% increase in the ruble/hryvnia/som/manat/dram to euro exchange rate at December 31, 2007. The increase in a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our euro-denominated monetary liabilities was mainly the result of ruble to euro exchange rate fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2007. We are unable to estimate future loss of earnings as a result of such changes. Item 12. Description of Securities Other Than Equity Securities Not applicable. 159 PART II Item 13. Defaults, Dividend Arrearages and Delinquencies None. Item 14. Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds A.-E. Not Applicable. Item 15. Controls and Procedures (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As required by Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2007. Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding our required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. In assessing disclosure controls and procedures, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Auditing Standard No. 5 defines a material weakness as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In accordance with this definition, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2007 were effective at a reasonable assurance level. (b) Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting refers to a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our 160 receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and members of our board of directors; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. As a result of management's evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, management concludes that internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, was effective. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, has been audited and assessed as effective by independent registered public accounting firm ZAO Deloitte & Touche CIS who has also audited and reported on our consolidated financial statements. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2007, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. (c) Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. To the Shareholders of OJSC Mobile TeleSystems: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Mobile TeleSystems, a Russian Open Joint-Stock Company, and subsidiaries ("the Group") as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Group's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Group's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A Group's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Group's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Group's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Group's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Group; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Group are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Group; and 161 (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Group's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 of the Group and our report dated April 15, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. /s/ ZAO Deloitte & Touche CIS Moscow April 15, 2008 (d) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. Management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, whether any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this annual report have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on the evaluation we conducted, management has concluded that no such changes have occurred. Remediation Activities In our annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that existed as of December 31, 2006 with respect to the interpretation and application of generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a put and call option agreement, dated as of November 2005, entered into with Nomihold Securities providing a right of the latter to sell the remaining 49% stake in Tarino Limited, the company controlling Bitel, to MTS Finance S.A. in accordance with the requirements of FASB Statement No. 140 "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, a replacement of FASB Statement 125." To remediate this material weakness, we adopted and exercised the following changes: In June 2007, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors directed management to strengthen control and reporting procedures over significant non-routine transactions where management's judgment, interpretation and application of complex accounting principles is exercised. During 2007, all such transactions were approved by the Audit Committee. Pursuant to the Audit Committee's directive, management has strengthened control and reporting procedures over significant non-routine transactions involving the exercise of interpretive judgment or application of complex accounting principles by adopting and implementing a policy pursuant to which such transactions require advance review and approval in accordance with the Audit Committee's directive. 162 Item 16A.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Group's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

F-8 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Business of the GroupOJSC Mobile TeleSystems and its subsidiaries ("MTS" or "the Group") is the largest provider of mobile telecommunications services in the Russian Federation ("RF", or "Russia"), Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Armenia and the second largest in Ukraine in terms of the number of subscribers and revenues. The Open Joint-Stock Company Mobile TeleSystems ("MTS OJSC", or "the Company") was created on March 1, 2000, through the merger of MTS CJSC and RTC CJSC, a wholly-owned subsidiary. MTS CJSC started its operations in the Moscow license area in 1994 and began expanding into nearby regions in 1997. Since that time, MTS has continued to grow by applying for Global System for Mobile Communication ("GSM") licenses in new regions and acquiring existing GSM license holders and operators. The Group provides a wide range of voice and data mobile telecommunications services, including text messages ("SMS"), picture messages ("MMS") and other data services. Services are provided to both consumers and corporate customers, through a variety of both prepaid and contract tariff arrangements. The Group's mobile services are currently offered over a GSM network, on which a General Packet Radio Service ("GPRS") service is also provided. In July 2006, Ukrainian Mobile Communications ("UMC"), MTS subsidiary in Ukraine, acquired a new CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) license, which is a 3G telecommunications standard, ratified by the International Telecommunication Union. UMC plans to start rendering services through the 3G network in 2008. In April 2007, MTS received a federal license allowing it to provide 3G services in Russia. In accordance with the conditions set forth in the tender documentation, the winning companies are required to begin commercial exploitation of a 3G network within two years from the time they receive the license. The Company is planning to start rendering commercial services under 3G license in 2008. In April 2007, the Communication and Information Agency of Uzbekistan allocated 2500-2700 MHz frequencies to Uzdunrobita, MTS subsidiary in Uzbekistan, thus allowing the Group to provide WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) services on the entire territory of the country. MTS plans to start providing access to the Internet using WiMAX in Tashkent by the end of 2008. Additionally, in April 2007 Uzdunrobita received a 3G license valid until the end of 2016 for the entire territory of Uzbekistan. 3G network will be launched in the major cities of the country, where there is effective customer demand and a need to increase network capacity. The Group is planning to launch its 3G network in 2008 in Tashkent followed by Samarkand, Bukhara and Andijan. In October 2007, the Public Services Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Armenia allocated 3G frequencies to CJSC K-Telecom ("K-Telecom"), MTS subsidiary thus allowing the Group to provide 3G services in Armenia. The allocation is valid for ten years. K-Telecom is licensed to offer 3G (UMTS) services by virtue of its general telecommunication license. The Group is organized by geography of its operations. MTS principal mobile operations are located in Russia, Ukraine and other CIS countries. In 2006, the Group established a new Business unit "MTS Russia", that is responsible for the operational management of all Russian macro-regions; Business unit "MTS Ukraine"; and Business unit "Foreign subsidiaries" that includes Uzdunrobita in F-9 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) Uzbekistan, Barash Communications Technologies, Inc. ("BCTI") in Turkmenistan, K-Telekom in Armenia and MTS Belarus, an equity accounted affiliate of MTS, in Belarus.

During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 MTS repurchased 17,402,835 and 11,161,000 of its own common shares, respectively, that represent 3,480,567 and 2,232,200 ADSs for $254.4 million and $110.0 million, respectively. As a result, the total shares in treasury stock of the Group comprised 32,476,837 and 15,922,128 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Sistema owned 100% of Sistema Holding, Invest-Svyaz, and VAST, which collectively resulted in Sistema's effective ownership in MTS of 53.6% and 53.1% (or 1,050,165,886 of common shares) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Each ADS initially represented 20 shares of common stock of the Company. Effective January 2005, the ratio was changed from 1 ADS per 20 ordinary shares to 1 ADS per 5 ordinary shares. The Company initially issued a total of 17,262,204 ADS, representing 345,244,080 common shares. Subsequently, due to the change in ratio of ADS per ordinary shares, trading of shares on the open market and the repurchase of 5,712,767 ADS by MTS during 2007 and 2006 the number of ADS changed to 155,479,301 and 155,310,125 (representing underlying ownership of 777,396,505 and 776,550,625 shares) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Since 2003, common shares of MTS OJSC have been traded on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange ("MICEX"). In 2007, the Board of Directors approved a dividend policy, whereby the Group will aim to make dividend payments to shareholders in the amount of at least 50% of annual net income under F-10 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) U.S. GAAP. The dividend could vary depending on a number of factors, including the outlook for earnings growth, capital expenditure requirements, cach flow operations, potential acquisition opportunities, as well as Group's debt position. Annual dividend payments, if any, must be recommended by the Board of Directors and approved by the shareholders. In accordance with Russian laws, earnings available for dividends are limited to profits determined in accordance with Russian statutory accounting regulations, denominated in rubles, after certain deductions. The net income of MTS OJSC for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 that is distributable under Russian legislation totalled 37,696 million rubles ($1,473.8 million, unaudited), 32,094 million rubles ($1,181.0 million) and 12,544 million rubles ($444.4 million), respectively.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting principlesMTS maintains its accounting books and records in Russian rubles for its subsidiaries located in the Russian Federation, in Ukrainian hryvnias for UMC, Uzbek som for Uzdunrobita, U.S. Dollars for BCTI, Turkmenian manat for the branch of BCTI in Turkmenistan and Armenian drams for K-Telecom based on respective local accounting and tax legislations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in order to present MTS financial position and its results of operations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") and are expressed in terms of U.S. Dollars. The accompanying consolidated financial statements differ from the financial statements used for statutory purposes in that they reflect various adjustments, not recorded on the entities' books, which are appropriate to present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance F-11 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) with U.S. GAAP. The principal adjustments are related to revenue recognition, foreign currency translation, deferred taxation, consolidation, acquisition accounting and depreciation and valuation of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and investments. Basis of consolidationWholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries where the Group has operating and financial control are consolidated. Those ventures where the Group exercises significant influence, but does not have operating and financial control are accounted for using the equity method. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. Investments in which the Group does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for under the cost method and included in other investments in the consolidated balance sheets. The Group's share in the net income of unconsolidated associates is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and disclosed in Note 17. Results of operations of subsidiaries acquired are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the date of their acquisition.

Translation methodologyUntil January 1, 2007, the functional currency for the majority of the Group's subsidiaries, excluding UMC, Kuban-GSM and BCTI where the functional currency was the local country currency, was the United States dollar ("U.S. Dollar") as the majority of revenue, cost, property and equipment purchased, debt and trade liabilities were either priced, incurred, payable or otherwise measured in U.S. Dollars. In April 2007, an amendment to the Russian Federal law on protection of consumer's rights was enforced prohibiting companies to set up prices in currencies other than Russian rubles. Following the expected changes in regulatory environment and due to growth in share of expenditures denominated or fixed in Russian rubles, the Group's subsidiaries in the Russian Federation began pricing its services and invoicing customers in Russian rubles from January 1, 2007. As a result of these changes, the Company reevaluated the functional currency criteria under SFAS No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation" ("SFAS No. 52"), and determined that, starting January 1, 2007, the functional currency of the Company's subsidiaries domiciled in Russia was the Russian ruble. Pursuant to SFAS No. 52 provisions, the change was adopted prospectively beginning January 1, 2007, and no retroactive restatement of previously issued financial statements was made. Non-monetary assets and liabilities acquired prior to when Russian economy ceased to be highly inflationary on January 1, 2003, were translated from U.S. Dollars to Russian rubles by using exchange rate at that date in accordance with EITF 92-4, "Accounting for a Change in Functional Currency When an Economy Ceases to Be Considered Highly Inflationary". The resulting balance became historical Russian ruble cost basis. For non-monetary assets and liabilities acquired subsequently January 1, 2003, the historical Russian ruble amounts were retained. F-13 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) The impact of the change in functional currency on the financial statements was an increase in the opening translated carrying values of the following non-monetary assets and liabilities and the related deferred taxes as of January 1, 2007: January 1, 2007 Property, plant and equipment, net 329,475 Intangible assets, net 66,235 Goodwill 9,961 Other non-current assets 6,501 Net deferred tax liability (57,798 ) Other, net 4,623 Total increase 358,997 This increase has been reflected in shareholders equity as a part of other comprehensive income as of January 1, 2007. MTS Belarus, the Group's equity investee, changed its functional currency from U.S. Dollar to Belarusian ruble prospectively from January 1, 2007. The impact of this change on MTS Belarus statement of financial position was not material to the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2007, the functional currencies of the Group entities were the following: For Russian entitiesRussian ruble; For UMCUkrainian hryvnia; For Turkmen branch of BCTITurkmenian manat; For UzdunrobitaU.S. Dollar; For K-TelecomArmenian dram; For MTS-BelarusBelarusian ruble; and For other entitiesU.S. Dollar. Each of the legal entities domiciled in Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Armenia and Belarus maintain their records and prepare their financial statements in the local currency, either Russian ruble, Ukrainian hryvnia, Uzbek som, Turkmenian manat, Armenian dram or Belarusian ruble, in accordance with the requirements of local statutory accounting and tax legislation. The Group has retained the U.S. Dollar as its reporting currency. Remeasurement of financial statements into functional currencies where applicable and translation of financial statements into U.S. Dollars has been performed in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 52: For entities whose records are not maintained in their functional currencies, monetary assets and liabilities have been remeasured at the period end exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities have been remeasured at historical rates. Revenues, expenses and cash flows have been remeasured at average rates. Remeasurement differences resulting from the use of these rates have been accounted for as currency exchange and transaction gains and losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. F-14 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) For Russian entities, UMC, K-Telecom, and for the Turkmen branch of BCTI where the functional currency is other than the reporting currency, the Russian ruble, Ukrainian hryvnia, Armenian dram and Turkmenian manat, respectively, all year-end balance sheet items have been translated into U.S. Dollars at the period-end exchange rate. Revenues and expenses have been translated at period average exchange rate. Translation differences resulting from the use of these rates are reported as a component of other comprehensive income. Management estimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for inventory obsolescence, business combinations, FIN No. 48 estimates, the recoverability of intangible assets and other long-lived assets, certain accrued liabilities and valuation of financial instruments. Cash and cash equivalentsCash represents cash on hand and in MTS bank accounts and short-term investments, including term deposits, having original maturities of less than three months. Short-term investmentsShort-term investments represent investments in time deposits, which have original maturities in excess of three months but less than twelve months. These investments are accounted for at cost. Allowance for doubtful accountsMTS provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management's periodic review for recoverability of accounts receivable from customers and other receivables. Prepaid expensesPrepaid expenses are primarily comprised of advance payments made to vendors for inventory and services. InventoryInventory mainly consists of handsets and accessories held for sale, spare parts, to be used for equipment maintenance within the next twelve months, advertising materials, and other inventory items. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value. Inventory cost is determined using the weighted average cost ("WAC") method. Handsets and accessories held for sale are expensed when sold. The Group periodically assesses its inventories for obsolete and slow-moving stock. Value-added tax ("VAT")Value-added tax related to sales is payable to the tax authorities on an accrual basis based upon invoices issued to the customer. VAT incurred for purchases may be reclaimed from the state, subject to certain restrictions, against VAT related to sales. Assets held for saleIn 2006, the Group management decided to discontinue use of certain telecommunication equipment ("Lucent equipment") in MTS Russia in accordance with the Group's network development strategy. The Group accounts for Lucent equipment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS No. 144") and reports Lucent equipment at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. The equipment had a fair value less costs to sell of approximately $67.4 million and $63.2 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. F-15 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) The Group has initially negotiated with a third party to sell this equipment during the year ended December 31, 2007. However, due to a wide range of geographical areas the equipment is located and its diversity, the Group reconsidered the time needed to sell the equipment in 2007 and, as a result, the original plan of sale was extended for another two years. Accordingly, part of Lucent equipment in the amount of $35.4 million, which is expected to be sold during 2008, was classified as other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. The remaining portion of equipment in the amount of $32.0 million, which is expected to be sold during 2009, was recorded in other non-current assets in the Group's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. Due to the fact that initial plan of sale was reconsidered, the fair value of Lucent equipment as of December 31, 2007, was determined using the discounted cash flows based on updated expected timing of sale. As a result, an impairment loss on Lucent equipment in the amount of $6.8 million was recorded as other operating expenses in the Group's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007. This loss is entirely attributable to "Russia" operating reportable segment. Property, plant and equipmentProperty, plant and equipment, including improvements that extend useful lives, are stated at cost. Property, plant and equipment with a useful life of more than one year is capitalized at historical cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Network and base station equipment 5 - 12 years Leasehold improvements shorter of 8 - 10 years or lease term Office equipment and computers 5 years Buildings 50 years Vehicles 4 years Construction in progress and equipment held for installation is not depreciated until the constructed or installed asset is ready for its intended use. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred, while upgrades and improvements are capitalized. Interest expense incurred during the construction phase of MTS network under development is capitalized as part of property, plant and equipment until the relevant projects are completed and placed into service. Asset retirement obligationsIn accordance with SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" and FASB Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligationsan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143" ("FIN No. 47"), the Group calculates an asset retirement obligation and an associated asset retirement cost when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation in connection with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. The adoption of FIN No. 47 did not have material impact on the Group's financial position or results of operations. The Group's obligations under SFAS No. 143 relate primarily to the cost of removing its equipment from sites. As of December 31, 2005, the estimated asset retirement obligations were not significant to the Group's consolidated financial position and results of operations. F-16 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the estimated present value of the Group's asset retirement obligations and change in liabilities were as follows: Balance as of December 31, 2006 $ 10,821 Liabilities incurred in the current period 3,115 Accretion expense 1,138 Revisions in estimated cash flows 44,453 Balance as of December 31, 2007 $ 59,527 The Group recorded the present value of assets retirement obligations as other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. Revisions in estimated cash flows are attributable to the increase in dismantlement works cost in dollar terms and change in the inflation rate forecast used for the calculation. License costsLicense costs are capitalized as a result of (a) the purchase price allocated to licenses acquired in business combinations and (b) licenses purchased directly from government organizations, which require license payments. The current operating licenses of the Group do not provide for automatic renewal upon expiration. As the Group and the industry do not have sufficient experience with the renewal of licenses, license costs are being amortized during the initial license period without consideration of possible future renewals, subject to periodic review for impairment, on a straight-line basis over three to fifteen years starting from the date such license becomes commercially operational. Other intangible assets and goodwillIntangible assets represent various purchased software costs, telephone numbering capacity, acquired customer base, rights to use radio frequencies and rights to use premises. A part of the rights to use premises was contributed by shareholders to the Group's charter capital. Telephone numbering capacity with a finite contractual life is being amortized over the contract period which varies from five to ten years and the rights to use premises are being amortized over five to fifteen years. Amortization of numbering capacity costs starts immediately upon the purchase of numbering capacity. Telephone numbering capacity with unlimited contractual life is not amortized, but is reviewed, at least annually, for impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"). Software and other intangible assets are amortized over one to fifteen years. Customer bases are amortized over their respective estimated average subscriber life, being from 20 to 60 months. Rights to use radio frequencies are amortized over the period of their contractual life, being from two to fifteen years. All finite-life intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. Goodwill represents an excess of the cost of business acquired over the fair market value of identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever it is determined that one or more impairment indicators exist. The Group determines whether impairment has occurred by assigning goodwill to the reporting unit identified in accordance with SFAS No. 142, and comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit to the fair value of the reporting unit. If an impairment of goodwill has occurred, the Group recognizes a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of goodwill. To date, no impairment of goodwill has occurred. F-17 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) Leasing arrangementsThe Group accounts for leases based on the requirements of SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases." Entities of the Group lease operating facilities, which include switches, base stations and other cellular network equipment. The Group also leases premises and other sites to install base stations equipment and towers. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease. For capital leases, the present value of future minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease is reflected as an asset and a liability in the balance sheet. Amounts due within one year are classified as short-term liabilities and the remaining balance as long-term liabilities. Investments impairmentManagement periodically assesses the recoverability of the carrying values of investments and, if necessary, records impairment losses to write the investments down to fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2005, no impairment of investments occurred. In 2006, the Group's investment in Bitel LLC ("Bitel") in the amount of $150 million was written down to $nil (Note 20). Impairment of long-lived assetsMTS periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144 Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets may not be recoverable, MTS compares undiscounted net cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets to the carrying amount of those assets. When these undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts of the assets, MTS records impairment losses to write the asset down to fair value, measured by the estimated discounted net future cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the assets. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2007 amounted to $10.0 million. No impairment loss occurred during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Subscriber prepaymentsMTS requires the majority of its customers to pay in advance for telecommunication services. All amounts received in advance of services provided are recorded as a subscriber prepayment liability and are not recorded as revenues until the related services have been provided to the subscriber. Treasury stockShares of common stock repurchased by the Group are recorded at cost as treasury stock and reduce the shareholders' equity in the Group's consolidated financial statements. Revenue recognitionThe Group records its revenues net of VAT. Revenues are recognized only when all of the following conditions have been met: (i) there is pervasive evidence of an arrangement; (ii) delivery of services and goods has occurred; (iii) the fees are fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectibility of the fees is reasonably assured. MTS categorizes its revenue sources in the statements of operations as follows: Service revenue and connection fees: (a) usage charges; (b) subscription fees; (c) value added service fees; (d) fees for connecting users of other operators' fixed line and wireless networks to MTS network ("interconnect fees"); (e) roaming fees charged to other operators for guest roamers utilizing MTS network; (f) connection fees; and Sales of handsets and accessories. F-18 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) Usage chargesUsage charges consist of fees determined based on airtime used by a subscriber, the destination of the call and the service utilized, and access charges. MTS recognizes revenues related to usage charges and access charges in the period when services are rendered. Subscription feesMTS recognizes revenues related to the monthly network subscription fees in the month when the service is provided to the subscriber. Value added service feesValue added service fees are determined based on the usage of airtime or the volume of data transmitted for value added services, such as short message services ("SMS"), including content services via SMS, internet usage and data services. The Group evaluates the criteria outlined in Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 99-19 "Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent" in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of services provided and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Revenue is recorded gross when MTS is primarily obligated in a transaction, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers of services, or has several but not all of these indicators. Roaming feesMTS charges roaming per-minute fees to other wireless operators for non-MTS subscribers utilizing MTS network. MTS recognizes such revenues when the services are provided. Interconnect feesEffective July 1, 2006, an amendment to the RF Federal Law on Communications implemented the "calling party pays", or CPP, principle prohibiting mobile operators from charging their subscribers for incoming calls. Previously, MTS charged subscribers in Russia for incoming calls. Under the new system, MTS charges the telecommunication operators of the calling party for incoming calls, and, in its turn, MTS pays other operators for the outgoing calls of its subscribers. MTS recognizes interconnect fees for incoming calls to customers from fixed line or wireless networks owed by other operators in the month when services to the customer are actually provided. Connection feesMTS defers the initial connection fees on its prepaid and postpaid tariff plans from the moment of initial signing of the contract with subscribers and activation of value added services over the estimated average subscriber life. Based on management analysis of the subscriber base in the regions where the Group operates the average expected subscriber life ranged from 12 to 60 months in 2005 and 2006, and from 14 to 60 months in 2007. Sales of handsets and accessoriesMTS sells wireless handsets and accessories to customers who are entering into contracts for service and also as separate distinct transactions. The Group recognizes revenues from the sale of wireless handsets and accessories when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as it is considered to be a separate earnings process from the sale of wireless services in accordance with EITF Issue No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables". The costs of wireless handsets and accessories, whether sold to subscribers through the distribution channel or as part of the service contract, are expensed when the associated revenue is recognized. Customer incentivesIncentives provided to customers are usually offered on signing a new contract or as part of a promotional offering. Incentives, representing the reduction of the selling price of the service (free minutes and discounts) are recorded in the period to which they relate, when the respective revenue is recognized, as a reduction to both accounts receivable and revenue. However, if the sales incentive is a free product or service delivered at the time of sale, the fair value of the free F-19 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) product or service is classified as an expense. In particular, MTS sells handsets at prices below cost to contract subscribers. Such subsidies are recognized in the cost of handsets and accessories when the sale is recorded. Prepaid phone cardsMTS sells prepaid phone cards to subscribers, separately from the handset. These cards allow subscribers to make a predetermined allotment of wireless phone calls and/or take advantage of other services offered by the Group, such as short messages and value-added services. The Group recognizes revenue from the services in the month when the services were actually rendered. Revenue from the sale of prepaid cards is deferred until the service is rendered to the customer uses the airtime or the card expires. Cost of servicesExpenses incurred by MTS in connection with the provision of wireless communication services mainly relate to interconnect and line rental costs, roaming expenses and costs of handsets and accessories sold. Calls made by MTS subscribers from areas outside of the territories covered by the Group's licenses are subject to roaming fees charged by the wireless provider in those territories. These fees are recorded as roaming expenses, as MTS acts as the principal in the transaction with the subscriber, being a primary obligor in providing the services, bearing the credit risk and having latitude in establishing roaming prices. MTS charges its subscribers for roaming fees paid to other networks based on the Group's existing tariffs and records such roaming fees as service revenues at the time the services are performed. TaxationDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of existing differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, and for the loss or tax credit carry-forwards using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect at the time these differences are realized. Valuation allowances are recorded for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. Accounting for uncertainty in income taxOn January 1, 2007, the Group adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN No. 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of SFAS No. 109". FIN No. 48 creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax position and clarifies the accounting for income taxes recognized by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statement. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on recognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, disclosure and transition. The Group recognizes interests and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The adoption of FIN No. 48 resulted in reduction on Group's accumulated income and additional accrual for unrecognized tax benefit, potential penalties and interest in the total amount of $0.6 million, $5.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively, which were recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2007 (see also Note 13). Sales and marketing expensesSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of dealers' commissions and advertising costs. Dealers' commissions are linked to revenues received during the six-month period from the date a new subscriber is activated by a dealer. MTS expenses these costs as incurred. Advertising costs for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, were $374,885, $321,451 and $248,610, respectively. F-20 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) Borrowing costsBorrowing costs include interest incurred on existing indebtedness and debt issuance costs. Interest costs for assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use are capitalized and amortized over the related assets' estimated useful lives. The capitalized interest costs for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $88,810, $70,274 and $54,229, respectively. Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the respective borrowings using the effective interest method. Interest expenses net of amounts capitalized and amortization of debt issuance costs, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, were $129,880, $138,977 and $110,422, respectively. Government Pension FundThe Group contributes to the local state pension and social funds, on behalf of all its employees. In Russia all social contributions are represented by a unified social tax ("UST") calculated by the application of a regressive rate from 26% to 2% of the annual gross remuneration of each employee. The UST is allocated to three social funds, including the pension fund, where the rate of contributions varies from 20% to 2%, depending on the annual gross salary of employee. These contributions are expensed as incurred. The amount of UST paid by the Group in Russia amounted to $42.8 million, $35.8 million and $35.3 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Armenia the subsidiaries of the Group are required to contribute a specified percentage of each employee payroll up to a fixed limit to the local pension fund, unemployment and social security funds. Payments to the pension fund in the Ukraine amounted to $11.7 million, $9.1 million and $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Amounts contributed to the pension funds in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Armenia were not significant. The Group does not participate in any pension funds other then described above. Earnings per shareBasic earnings per shares ("EPS") have been determined using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS reflect the potential dilutive effect of stock options granted to employees. There are 1,397,256, 1,435,001 and 3,187,240 stock options outstanding as at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The following is the reconciliation of the share component for basic and diluted EPS with respect to the Group's net income: December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding, basic 1,973,354,348 1,987,610,121 1,986,819,999 Dilutive effect of stock options, as if exercised 720,560 35,894 290,040 Weighted average number of common shares and potential shares outstanding, diluted 1,974,074,908 1,987,646,015 1,987,110,039 Financial instruments and hedging activitiesFrom time to time in its acquisitions, the Group uses financial instruments, consisting of put and call options on all or part of the minority stakes of acquired companies, to defer payment of the purchase price and provide optimal acquisition structuring. These F-21 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) put and call options qualify as freestanding financial instruments and are accounted in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 150 "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" and EITF 00-6 "Accounting for Freestanding Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, the Stock of a Consolidated Subsidiary". From time to time the Group enters into variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to variability in expected future cash flows of its variable-rate long term debt, which is caused by interest rate fluctuations. The Group accounts for these swaps in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and SFAS No. 149 "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." All derivatives are recorded as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measured at their respective fair values. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement. The Group's interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and the hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting. Accordingly, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements is recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to interest expense in the same period that the related cash flows of the hedged transaction affect the interest expense. At the inception of the hedge, and on a quarterly basis, the Group performs an analysis to assess whether changes in the cash flows of its interest rate swap agreements are deemed highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged debt. If at any time the correlation assessment indicates that the interest rate swap agreements are no longer effective as a hedge, the Group discontinues hedge accounting and all subsequent changes in fair value are recorded in net income. The Group does not use financial instruments for trading purposes. Fair value of financial instrumentsThe fair market value of financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, derivative financial instruments, accounts receivable and accounts payable, which are included in current assets and liabilities, approximates the carrying value of these items due to the short term nature of these amounts. Based on the Luxemburg stock exchange quotes as of December 31, 2007, the $400 million Notes due in 2008 had a fair value of 100.0% or $400 million, the $400 million Notes due in 2010 had a fair value of 103.8% or $415 million and the $400 million Notes due in 2012 had a fair value of 103.1% or $412 million. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of other fixed rate debt including capital lease obligations approximated its carrying value. The fair value of variable rate debt approximates its carrying value. F-22 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) Comprehensive incomeComprehensive income is defined as net income plus all other changes in net assets from non-owner sources. The following is the reconciliation of total comprehensive income, net of tax for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net income $ 2,071,504 $ 1,075,738 $ 1,126,405 Effect of change in functional currency 358,997   Currency translation adjustment 256,390 41,315 24,898 Change in fair value of interest rate swaps, net of tax of $352, $794 and $1,033, respectively (1,114 ) (2,013 ) 3,272 Total comprehensive income $ 2,685,777 $ 1,115,040 $ 1,154,575 Stock-based compensationPrior to December 31, 2005, MTS accounted for stock options issued to employees under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, Compensation" ("APB No.25"), as permitted by FASB Statement No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No.123") and SFAS No. 148 "Accounting for Stock Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure, an Amendment to FASB Statement No. 123". Under the requirements of these statements, the Group elected to use the intrinsic method to measure share-based awards for the purposes of recording share-based compensation expense for awards granted to employees. Effective from January 1, 2006, MTS adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 123R "Share based payments" (SFAS No. 123R), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123. Under SFAS No. 123R companies must calculate and record the cost of equity instruments, such as stock options awarded to employees for services received in income statement. The cost of the equity instruments is to be measured based on the fair value of the instruments on the day they are granted (with certain exceptions) and is recognized over the period during which the employees are required to provide services in exchange for equity instruments. The Group adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified-prospective-application transition method. Under this transition method, compensation cost for all share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2006, was determined based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original requirements of SFAS No. 123, using the same assumptions and taken into account the estimated forfeitures. F-23 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) If the Group had recognized compensation costs following the provisions of the SFAS No. 123 in the year ended December 31, 2005, net income and earning per share amounts would have been as follows: December 31, 2005 Net income as reported $ 1,126,405 Add: Stock-based compensation included in reported net income, net of related tax effects 1,175 Less: Pro forma stock-based compensation under SFAS No.123, net of related tax effects (2,891 ) Pro forma net income $ 1,124,689 Earnings per sharebasic and diluted As reported $ 0.57 Pro forma $ 0.57 Comparative informationCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. New and recently adopted accounting pronouncementsIn September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair value measurements" ("SFAS No. 157"). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure requirements of fair value measurement. SFAS No. 157 is applicable to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement, and accordingly, does not require any fair value measurement. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Group adopted SFAS No. 157 as of January 1, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material impact on the Group's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities"including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" ("SFAS No.159"), which permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 159 offers an irrevocable option to carry the vast majority of financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings (the fair value option, or FVO). The Statement's objective is to improve financial reporting by allowing entities to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by the measurement of related assets and liabilities using different attributes, without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS No.159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. The Group does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141R, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141R"), and FAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of ARB No. 51" ("SFAS No. 160"). These statements substantially elevate the role played by fair value and dramatically change the way companies account for business combinations and noncontrolling interests (minority interests in current GAAP). SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No.160 will require among other changes: (a) more assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at fair value as of the F-24 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) acquisition date; (b) liabilities related to contingent consideration to be remeasured at fair value in each subsequent reporting period; (c) an acquirer to expense acquisition-related costs; and (d) noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries initially to be measured at fair value and classified as a separate component of equity. Both Statements are to be applied prospectively (with one exception related to income taxes) for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. However, SFAS No.160 requires entities to apply the presentation and disclosure requirements retrospectively (e.g., by reclassifying noncontrolling interests to appear in equity) to comparative financial statements, if presented. Both standards prohibit early adoption. The Group is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160 may have on its financial position and results of operations. In connection with the issuance of SFAS No. 160, the SEC revised EITF Topic D-98 "Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities" ("Topic D-98") to include the SEC Staff's views regarding the interaction between Topic D-98 and SFAS No. 160. The revised Topic D-98 indicates that the classification, measurement, and earnings-per-share guidance required by Topic D-98 applies to noncontrolling interests (e.g., when the noncontrolling interest is redeemable at a fixed price by the holder or upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer). This includes noncontrolling interests redeemable at fair value. The revisions to Topic D-98 that are specific to accounting for noncontrolling interests should be applied no later than the effective date of SFAS No. 160. The Group is currently evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS No. 160 and Topic D-98 will have on the accounting and disclosure of the Group's minority interest. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 161"). The new standard is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. It is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The Group is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 161 on the Group's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 3.

The Group is also required to take all commercially reasonable steps necessary to maintain a rating of the notes from Moody's or Standard & Poor's. The notes also have cross default provisions with publicly traded debt issued by Sistema, the shareholder of the Group. If the Group fails to meet these covenants, after certain notice and cure periods, the noteholders can accelerate the debt to be immediately due and payable. Management believes that the Group is in compliance with all restrictive notes covenants provisions during the three year period ended December 31, 2007.

None of the stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2007 were exercisable. The fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2005, was estimated using the lattice model based on the following assumptions: 2007 2005 Risk free rate 3.1 % 4.7 % Expected dividend yield 0.3 % 3 % Expected volatility 40.3 % 40.0 % Expected life, years 2 2 Fair value of options (per share), U.S. Dollar $ 5.95 $ 1.74 Compensation costs under Stock Option Plan of $2.8 million, $1.7 million and $1.5 million was recognized in consolidated statements of operations during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.54 years. In accordance with the Russian legislation, MTS Board members and key employees may be considered insiders with respect to the Group and thus may be restricted from selling their shares. Phantom Stock Plan In June 2007, MTS board of directors approved the Phantom Stock Plan to provide deferred compensation to certain key employees (the "Participants") of the Group. The plan is based on units equivalent to the Company's common shares (the "Phantom Shares"). Under the Phantom Stock Plan, the Participants are entitled to a cash payment equal to the difference between the initial grant price and the exercise price of Phantom Shares, multiplied by the number of Phantom Shares granted, upon vesting of the award. The initial grant price is determined based on average market share price during the hundred day period preceding the grant date. The exercise price of Phantom Shares is determined based on average market share price during the hundred day period preceding the vesting date. The vesting period is two years from the grant date, contingent upon the continuing employment of the Participants by the Group. Further, the award shall vest only if at the end of the vesting period the cumulative percentage of the Company's market capitalization growth since the grant date exceeds the cumulative cost of equity determined by the Board of Directors for the same period. The Group has a maximum of 3,600,000 phantom ADSs, or 18,000,000 Phantom Shares, reserved for issuance under the Phantom Stock Plan, of which 720,000 ADSs, or 3,600,000 Phantom Shares, were granted in 2007.

The respective liability of $7.6 million was included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, there was $23.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested Phantom Shares. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years. The Group is required to estimate expected forfeiture rate, as well as the probability that performance conditions that affect the vesting of Phantom Shares awards will be achieved and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. The Group's estimated forfeiture rate was 5.1%. The effect of forfeitures amounted to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Rosno OJSC ("Rosno")MTS arranged medical insurance for its employees and property insurance with Rosno (a subsidiary of Sistema until February, 2007). Insurance premiums paid to Rosno for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, amounted to $11.3 million and $12.6 million, respectively. Staring from February, 2007, Rosno is no longer a related party of the Group, as Sistema sold its controlling stake in Rosno to Allianz. SitronicsSitronics Telecom Solutions Czech Republic and Russia, formerly Strom Telecom and Mediatel, are subsidiaries of Sistema. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Group acquired from these companies telecommunications equipment, billing systems (FORIS) and related services for approximately $67.1 million, $231.2 million and $179.2 million, respectively.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES General and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, comprised the following: December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Salaries and social contributions $ 562,924 $ 430,443 $ 336,203 Rent 179,436 123,378 79,869 General and administrative 145,109 125,934 100,257 Repair and maintenance 142,969 94,242 90,609 Taxes other than income 141,254 88,089 62,102 Billing and data processing 36,052 44,886 37,287 Consulting expenses 23,742 23,352 26,486 Insurance 12,063 10,723 16,804 Inventory obsolescence expense   9,112 General and administrative expenses $ 1,243,549 $ 941,047 $ 758,729 17. INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO ASSOCIATES At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Group's investments in and advances to associates comprised the following: December 31, 2007 2006 MTS Belarusequity investment $ 188,622 $ 119,802 MTS Belarusloans receivable  21,341 Coral/Sistema Strategic Fundequity investment 6,916  Receivables from other investee companies 370 330 Total investments in and advances to associates $ 195,908 $ 141,473 F-48 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) MTS BelarusAs of December 31, 2006, the Group provided MTS Belarus with a total of $21.3 million in loans. These loans bore interest of 3% to 11% per annum. As of December 31, 2007 these loans were fully repaid. Coral/Sistema Strategic FundIn August 2007, the Group purchased an equity interest in a strategic fund organized by Sistema in order to invest in various projects in the telecommunications and high-technology area. The fund is organized in the form of limited partnership. The Group has committed to invest up to $26.3 million if called upon by the General Partner. The equity investment in TS-Retail is recorded at $nil as of December 31, 2007. See also Note 15. The Group's share in net income of associates is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, this share amounted to $72.7 million, $58.1 million and $42.4 million, respectively. 18. RESTRICTED CASH Restricted cash of $28.6 million and $24.8 million, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, consists of cash deposited by Uzdunrobita in a special bank account, which was created to be in compliance with government regulation of local currency conversion into foreign currencies. The cash deposited will be further converted from Uzbek som into U.S. Dollars and used for settlements with suppliers of equipment and software. 19. OPERATING LICENSES In connection with providing telecommunication services, the Group has been issued various operating GSM licenses by the Russian Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications. In addition to the licenses received directly from the Russian Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications, the Group has been granted access to various telecommunication licenses through acquisitions. In foreign subsidiaries, the licenses are granted by the local Communication authorities. F-49 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the recorded values of the Group's telecommunication licenses were as follows: December 31, 2007 2006 Moscow license area $ 302,724 $ 233,970 Armenia 246,917  Uzbekistan 196,517 40,861 Asian Russian regions 196,119 179,473 NorthWest region 96,648 74,639 Ukraine 63,535 63,535 Far East 58,091 48,107 European Russia Regions 53,382 111,198 Turkmenistan 50,504 50,503 Krasnodar, Adygeya and Northern Osetia 9,985 149,986 Tatarstan Republic  104,159 Other 100,027 96,143 Licenses, at cost 1,374,449 1,152,574 Accumulated amortization (708,844 ) (747,076 ) Licenses, net $ 665,605 $ 405,498 Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, amounted to $195.7 million, $211.3 million and $194.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, operating licenses related to Tatarstan Republic and the majority of licenses related to Krasnodar, Adygeya and Northern Osetia were fully amortized and their respective cost and accumulated amortization were written off from the consolidated balance sheet. Based on the cost of amortizable operating licenses existing at December 31, 2007, the estimated future amortization expenses are $148.1 million during 2008, $86.0 million during 2009, $78.8 million during 2010, $55.5 million during 2011, $42.0 million during 2012 and $255.2 million thereafter. The actual amortization expense reported in future periods could differ from these estimates as a result of new intangible assets acquisitions, changes in useful lives and other relevant factors. In 2006, each of the Group's licenses, except for the licenses covering the Moscow license area and Uzbekistan, contained a requirement for service to be commenced and for subscriber number and territorial coverage targets to be achieved by a specified date. In 2007, there were alterations in terms of licenses covering the Russian Federation. The requirements for subscriber numbers and territorial coverage targets were revoked. Instead, the targets were set for start date of service. Management believes that the Group is in compliance with all material terms of its licenses. The Group's operating licenses do not provide for automatic renewal. However, licenses that expired during the year ended December 31, 2007, were renewed. The cost to renew the licenses was not significant. The Group has limited experience with the renewal of its existing licenses. Management believes that licenses required for the Group's operations will be renewed upon expiration. F-50 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) 20. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Capital commitmentsAs of December 31, 2007, the Group had executed purchase agreements of approximately $252.7 million to acquire property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Operating leasesThe Group has entered into non-cancellable agreements to lease the space for telecommunication equipment, offices and transmission channels, which expire in various years up to 2056. Rental expenses under the operating leases of $179.4 million, $123.4 million and $73.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, are included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Future minimum lease payments due under these leases at December 31, 2007 are as follows: Payments due in the years ended December 31, 2008 $ 184,281 2009 32,963 2010 23,186 2011 12,759 2012 9,372 Thereafter 37,553 Total $ 300,114 Operating environmentThe Russian and Ukrainian economies, while deemed to be of market status, continue to display certain traits consistent with that of an emerging market. These characteristics have in the past included higher than normal inflation, insufficient liquidity of the capital markets, and the existence of currency controls. The continued success and stability of the Russian and Ukrainian economies will be subject to their government's continued actions with regard to supervisory, legal and economic reforms. The Federal Law on Communications sets the legal basis for the telecommunications business in Russia and defines the status that state bodies have in the telecommunications sector. In addition, the law created a universal service fund ("USF") charge, which became effective May 3, 2005, calculated as 1.2% of revenue from services provided to customers, excluding interconnection and other operators' traffic routing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Group incurred approximately $64.8 million, $54.2 million and $30.3 million in USF charges, respectively, which are recorded in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Group's operations in Turkmenistan are subject to certain restrictions in accordance with the local regulatory environment including, but not limited to, the sale of hard currency on the local market and hard currency repatriation. The effect of those restrictions on the financial statements is represented by a loss from currency translation transactions in Turkmenistan of $22.0 million and $24.3 million recognized as other non-operating expense in the Group's consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The amount of loss from currency translation transactions for the year ended December 31, 2005 was insignificant. TaxationRussia and Ukraine currently have a number of laws related to various taxes imposed by both federal and regional governmental authorities. Applicable taxes include VAT, corporate income tax (profits tax), a number of turnover-based taxes, and payroll (social) taxes, together with others. Laws F-51 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) related to these taxes have not been in force for significant periods, in contrast to more developed market economies; therefore, the government's implementation of these regulations is often inconsistent or nonexistent. Accordingly, few precedents with regard to tax rulings have been established. Tax declarations, together with other legal compliance areas (for example, customs and currency control matters), are subject to review and investigation by a number of authorities, which are enabled by law to impose extremely severe fines, penalties and interest charges. These facts create tax risks in Russia that are more significant than typically found in countries with more developed tax systems. In September 2006, the Russian tax authorities audited MTS OJSC's compliance with tax legislation for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004. Based on the results of this audit, the Russian tax authorities assessed that 1,283,660 thousand rubles (approximately $52.3 million as of December 31, 2007) of additional taxes, penalties and fines were payable by the Group. The Group has prepared and filed a petition with the Arbitration Court of Moscow to recognize the tax authorities' resolution to be partially invalid. The amount of disputed taxes and fines equals 1,220,096 thousand rubles (approximately $49.7 million). In 2007, a final court hearing considered this matter which resulted in a judgment in favour of the Group. Tax authorities prepared an appeal with Court of Appeal; however the judgment was not changed. As of December 31, 2007, no provision in relation to the above tax audit was accrued in the Group's financial statements or paid to tax authorities. Generally, according to Russian tax legislation tax declarations remain open and subject to inspection for a period of three years following the tax year. As of December 31, 2007, tax declarations of MTS OJSC and other subsidiaries in Russia for the preceding three fiscal years were open for further review, assuming no resolution issued based on the results of tax audit of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006. In January 2008, the Russian tax authorities started auditing MTS OJSC's compliance with tax legislation for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006. As of the date of these statements, the audit has not been finalized. Official resolution is not expected before July 2008, and it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome. There are regulatory uncertainties in Ukraine related to the treatment for VAT purposes of contributions payable to the Ukrainian State Pension Fund ("Pension Fund") in respect of the cash paid for the consumption of telecommunication services by customers. Also it could have influence on income tax and other taxes paid by the Group. As a result of a tax audit of the period from July 1, 2004 to April 1, 2007, additional VAT charges (including penalties) calculated on the Pension Fund contributions could be up to $11.5 million. In 2005, UMC initiated a litigation case in respect of this issue against the tax authorities, and has received favorable rulings from the courts on three occasions (the most recent from the Highest Administrative Court of Ukraine). Management believes that VAT was not applicable to the Pension Fund contributions during the period under the tax authorities' review. Further, management believes that UMC is in line with industry practice and has already defended its position in the courts. At December 31, 2007, no VAT charges in relation to the above litigation was accrued in the Group's financial statements or paid to the tax authorities. In 2008, tax authorities completed audit procedures in Uzdunrobita, BCTI and K-Telekom for the year ended December 31, 2006. According to the local tax legislation of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Armenia tax declarations remain open for further inspection for five, six and three years, respectively. F-52 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) Further, MTS purchases supplemental software from the foreign suppliers of the telecommunication equipment in the ordinary course of business. The Group's management believes that custom duties are calculated in compliance with the legislation. However there is a risk that the customs authorities may take a different view and impose additional custom duties. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, no provision was recorded in the consolidated financial statements in respect of such additional duties. Management believes that it has adequately provided for tax and customs liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the provision accrued amounted to $25.4 million and $29.8 million, respectively. However, the risk remains that the relevant authorities could take differing positions with regard to interpretive issues and the effect could be significant. BitelIn December 2005, MTS Finance acquired a 51% stake in Tarino Limited ("Tarino") for $150.0 million in cash from Nomihold Securities Inc. ("Nomihold"). Tarino was at that time the indirect owner, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, of Bitel LLC ("Bitel"), a Kyrgyz company holding a GSM 900/1800 license for the entire territory of Kyrgyzstan. Concurrently with the purchase of a 51% stake, the Group entered into a put and call option agreement with Nomihold to acquire the remaining 49% interest in Tarino. The call option was exercisable by the Group from November 22, 2005 to November 17, 2006, and the put option was exercisable by the seller from November 18, 2006 to December 8, 2006. The call and put option price was $170.0 million. The put and call option was recorded at fair value, which approximated $nil at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, a liability of $170.0 million was recorded. After the decision of the Kyrgyz Supreme Court on December 15, 2005, Bitel's corporate offices were seized by a third party. The Group could not re-gain operating control over Bitel's operations. During 2006, the Group took steps to vindicate its ownership rights on Bitel although these efforts so far have not proven to be successful. The matter was brought to the Kyrgyz Prosecutor General for investigation. On January 15, 2007, the Prosecutor General informed the Group that it sees no grounds to become involved in the ownership dispute over Bitel and additionally stated that the Group had no basis to appeal the decision of the Kyrgyz courts in connection with ownership of Bitel. In addition, an appeal to overturn certain adverse Kyrgyz courts rulings connected with ownership rights to Bitel was also filed with the Kyrgyz Supreme Court on December 15, 2006, but the time period in which the appeal should have been heard has expired without any action by the court. Consequently the decision was made by the Group to write off the costs associated with the purchase of 51% stake in Bitel. As of December 31, 2006, the investment was fully impaired and the related charge of $150.0 million was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Furthermore, as noted above, with the impairment of the underlying asset, a liability of $170.0 million was recorded with an associated charge to non-operating expenses. In January 2007, Nomihold commenced an arbitration proceeding against MTS Finance in the London Court of International Arbitration in order to compel MTS Finance to purchase the remaining 49% stake in Tarino Limited for $170.0 million. Nomihold seeks specific performance of the put option, unspecified monetary damages, interest, and costs. The matter is currently pending. F-53 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) A group of individual shareholders of Sistema, the majority shareholder of MTS OJSC, has agreed to compensate MTS Finance for any potential loss up to $170.0 million should the arbitration decision regarding exercise of the aforementioned put option prove unfavourable to MTS Finance. In a separate arbitration proceeding initiated against the KFG Companies (three Isle of Man companies affiliated with the Group) by Kyrgyzstan Mobitel Investment Company Limited (KMIC) under the rules of the London Court of International Arbitration, the arbitration tribunal in its award found that the KFG Companies breached a May 31, 2003 Transfer Agreement concerning the shares of Bitel. Tarino owned Bitel through KFG Companies. The Transfer Agreement was made between the KFG Companies and IPOC International Growth Fund Limited (IPOC) although IPOC subsequently assigned its interest to KMIC, and KMIC was the claimant in the arbitration. The tribunal ruled that the KFG Companies breached the Transfer Agreement when they failed to establish a date on which the equity interests in Bitel were to be transferred to KMIC and by failing to take other steps to transfer the Bitel interests. This breach occurred prior to MTS Finance's acquisition of the KFG Companies. The arbitration tribunal ruled that KMIC is entitled only to damages in an amount to be determined in future proceedings. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these proceedings or the amount of damages to be paid, if any. In addition, the KFG Companies have been named defendants in lawsuits filed by Bitel in the Isle of Man seeking the return of dividends received by these three companies in the first quarter of 2005 from Bitel in the amount of approximately $25.2 million plus compensatory damages, and to recover approximately $3.7 million in losses and accrued interest. In the event that the defendants do not prevail in these lawsuits, MTS may be liable to Bitel for such claims. The KFG Companies have also asserted counterclaims against Bitel, and claims against other defendants including Altimo and Altimo Holding, for the wrongful appropriation and control of Bitel. In November 2007 the Isle of Man court declined the jurisdiction for this claim which decision was immediately appealed by the KFG Companies. It is not possible at this time to predict the outcome or resolution of these claims. In the ordinary course of business, MTS may be party to various legal, tax and customs proceedings, and subject to claims, certain of which relate to the developing markets and evolving fiscal and regulatory environments in which MTS operates. In the opinion of management, the Group's liability, if any, in all such pending litigation, other legal proceeding or other matters will not have a material effect upon its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of MTS. 21. SEGMENT INFORMATION SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information", established standards for reporting information about operating segments in financial statements. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise engaging in business activities about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker or group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Group has three business units: business unit "MTS Russia", which is responsible for the centralized operational management of business in all Russian macro-regions, all of which operate in the same economic environment and possess similar economic characteristics; business unit "MTS Ukraine", MTS subsidiary in Ukraine; and business unit "Foreign subsidiaries" that include F-54 OJSC MOBILE TELESYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share amounts or if otherwise stated) Uzdunrobita in Uzbekistan, Barash Communications Technologies, Inc. in Turkmenistan, K-Telekom in Armenia and MTS Belarus, an equity accounted affiliate of MTS in Belarus. Countries of operations are managed separately due to their different economic and regulatory environment that requires separate marketing and investment strategies. The chief operating decision maker evaluates performance based on the operating income of each business unit. The Group's management has defined two operating reportable segments: Russia and Ukraine. Intercompany eliminations presented below consist primarily of sales transactions between segments conducted under the normal course of operations.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Mobilnye Sistemy Svyazi (MSS)In line with the Group's strategy of consolidating ownership in its subsidiaries, MTS purchased an additional 9% stake in its Omsk subsidiary, Mobilnye Sistemy Svyazi, from a private investor for $16.0 million in cash. As a result of this transaction, MTS' ownership in the subsidiary increases to 100%. Redemption of $400 million EurobondThe Group redeemed its $400.0 million Eurobond which matured on January 30, 2008. The coupon payments for the entire period, including the last coupon, which took place simultaneously with the retirement of Eurobond, amounted to $195.0 million. The Eurobond was issued in January 2003 in the amount of $400.0 million with a semi-annual coupon rate of 9.75%.
