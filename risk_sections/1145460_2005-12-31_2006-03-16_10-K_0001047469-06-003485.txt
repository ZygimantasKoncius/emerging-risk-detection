Risk Factors," which begins on page 11 of this report, as well as those factors identified from time to time in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. This report and, in particular, the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, should be read in light of those risks and uncertainties and in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Financial Overview Net revenues in 2005 of $421.9 million increased by $47.9 million, or 13%, from $374.0 million in 2004 as a result of acquisitions completed during 2005 and from higher license revenue principally resulting from a settlement and licensing arrangement that we entered into in April 2005. The acquisitions that we completed during 2005 were principally within our professional diagnostics segment. These acquisitions, including Binax in March 2005, the Determine rapid diagnostics business in June 2005, and BioStar and IDT in September 2005, added market leading flu and HIV tests to our expanding portfolio of rapid diagnostic tests and, in the case of IDT, expanded our direct distribution capabilities in Spain and Portugal. In addition to these acquisitions, we also expanded our depth in cardiology with the March 2005 acquisition of Ischemia. Ischemia's product is the only FDA-cleared in vitro diagnostic test targeted to the diagnosis of cardiac ischemia. Gross profit increased by $5.3 million, or 4%, to $152.3 million in 2005 from $147.0 million in 2004 principally as a result of higher gross profit on increased license revenue and from gross profit earned on incremental revenues from acquired businesses. Offsetting these increases were a variety of charges discussed in more detail below totaling $8.1 million associated with the closing of one of our manufacturing facilities in 2005 and with charges associated with excess inventories and a product recall. Gross profit from our nutritional supplements business also decreased $6.0 million principally as a result of continuing pricing pressures in our private label nutritional supplements business. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to better integrate and utilize our existing and recently acquired or established manufacturing facilities in 2006 in an effort to continue to enhance our ability to deliver high quality products on an increasingly cost effective basis. We continue to invest aggressively in research and development of new products and technologies. While reported research and development expense decreased by $1.0 million in 2005 from 2004, our expenditures in 2005 are reported net of $17.2 million arising from the co-development funding arrangement that we entered into with ITI Scotland in February 2005. Research and development 30 expense before considering the co-development funding was $48.2 million in 2005, an increase of $16.2 million from 2004. The increase in spending resulted in part from expenditures of $5.0 million in our professional diagnostics business associated with our acquisitions of Binax, BioStar and Ischemia. The remaining research and development spending primarily related to our continued significant investment in the development of products in the field of cardiology. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net Product Sales. Net product sales increased by $41.0 million, or 11%, to $406.5 million in 2005 from $365.4 million in 2004. Excluding the unfavorable impact of currency translation, net product sales in 2005 grew by approximately $41.8 million, or 11%, over 2004. Revenue increased as a result of our acquisitions in 2005: (i) Binax, acquired on March 31, 2005, contributed $18.4 million of such increase, (ii) the Determine rapid diagnostics business, acquired June 30, 2005, contributed revenues of $17.2 million, (iii) BioStar, acquired September 30, 2005, contributed revenues of $6.9 million, and (iv) various less significant acquisitions contributed an aggregate of $9.7 million of such increase. Net Product Sales by Business Segment. Net product sales by business segment for 2005 and 2004 are as follows: 2005 2004 % Increase (decrease) (in thousands) (restated) Consumer diagnostic products $ 161,695 $ 158,706 2 % Vitamins and nutritional supplements 75,411 77,923 (3 )% Professional diagnostic products 169,351 128,803 31 % Total net product sales $ 406,457 $ 365,432 11 % The currency adjusted increase in net product sales from our consumer diagnostic products was $3.5 million, or 2%, comparing 2005 to 2004. Of the currency adjusted increase, $1.9 million resulted from our acquisition of the consumer pregnancy test business of Advanced Clinical Systems Pty Ltd, or ACS, in January 2005. Organic growth, principally in the U.S., accounted for the remaining growth. Net product sales of our vitamins and nutritional supplements decreased by $2.5 million, or 3%, comparing 2005 to 2004. The decrease was primarily our brand name nutritional business. Our aggregate sales of all of our brand name nutritional products, including, among others, Ferro-Sequels, Stresstabs, Protegra, Posture, SoyCare, ALLBEE, and Z-BEC, have declined on an annual basis over the past several years. We believe that these products have under-performed because they are, for the most part, aging brands with limited brand recognition that face increasing private label competition. The currency adjusted increase in net product sales from our professional diagnostic products was $40.8 million, or 32%, comparing 2005 to 2004. Of the currency adjusted increase, revenue increased as a result of our acquisitions in 2005: (i) Binax contributed $18.4 million of such increase, (ii) the Determine rapid diagnostics business contributed revenues of $17.2 million, (iii) BioStar contributed revenues of $6.9 million, and (iv) various less significant acquisitions contributed an aggregate of $7.8 million of such increase. 31 Net Product Sales by Geographic Location. Net product sales by geographic location for 2005 and 2004 are as follows: 2005 2004 % Increase (in thousands) (restated) United States $ 234,229 $ 218,251 7 % Europe 108,981 98,136 11 % Other 63,247 49,045 29 % Total net product sales $ 406,457 $ 365,432 11 % The growth in net product sales in all geographic regions resulted from the various acquisitions discussed above. License and Royalty Revenue. License and royalty revenue represents license and royalty fees from intellectual property license agreements with third-parties. License and royalty revenue increased by $6.8 million, or 80%, to $15.4 million in 2005 from $8.6 million in 2004. The increase primarily relates to royalty revenues received as a result of the settlement and licensing arrangement that we entered into with Quidel Corporation in April 2005. Gross Profit and Margin. Gross profit increased by $5.3 million, or 4%, to $152.3 million in 2005 from $147.0 million in 2004. The increase in gross profit was attributable to higher gross margins on the increased license revenue discussed above. Offsetting this increase was: (i) the inclusion in cost of sales of a $4.1 million charge principally associated with our decision to close our CDIL manufacturing facility, (ii) a charge of $2.4 million associated with a reserve established during the second quarter of 2005 at our Wampole subsidiary for excess quantities of certain raw materials and finished goods, including certain finished goods held at distributors but subject to rights of return, and (iii) a $1.6 million provision for returns and inventory reserve which was established as a result of our recall of the drugs of abuse diagnostic products during the first quarter of 2005, offset in part by the gross profit earned on increased professional diagnostics products revenue, as discussed above. Gross profit from our nutritional supplements business decreased $6.0 million from $8.8 million in 2004 to $2.7 million in 2005. Our private label nutritional supplements business has suffered from excess capacity in the industry and increasing price competition. Overall gross margin was 36% in 2005 compared to 39% in 2004. Overall gross margin in 2005 was adversely affected by the $4.1 million charge associated with the CDIL closing, the $2.4 million Wampole inventory reserve, and the $1.6 million returns and inventory reserve associated with the drugs of abuse product recalls discussed above. Excluding these charges, gross margin was 38% for 2005. Gross Profit from Net Product Sales by Business Segment. Gross profit from net product sales represents total gross profit less gross profit associated with license revenue. Gross profit from total net product sales decreased by $0.3 million to $141.5 million in 2005 from $141.8 million in 2004. Gross profit from net product sales by business segment for 2005 and 2004 are as follows: 2005 2004 % Increase (decrease) (in thousands) (restated) Consumer diagnostic products $ 76,515 $ 82,909 (8 )% Vitamins and nutritional supplements 2,738 8,775 (69 )% Professional diagnostic products 62,252 50,079 24 % Total gross profit from net product sales $ 141,505 $ 141,763 0 % 32 Gross profit from our consumer diagnostic product sales decreased by $6.4 million, or 8%, comparing 2005 to 2004. Included in cost of sales, and adversely effecting gross profit, was a $4.1 million charge principally associated with our decision to close our CDIL manufacturing facility. Gross profit from our consumer diagnostic product sales was 47% for 2005 compared to 52% in 2004. Excluding the $4.1 million CDIL closure charge discussed above, gross margin from our consumer diagnostic products segment was 50% in 2005. The remaining decrease in gross margin from our consumer diagnostic product sales resulted from change in product mix. Gross profit in our vitamins and nutritional supplements business decreased by $6.0 million, or 69%, comparing 2005 to 2004. Our private label nutritional supplements business has suffered from excess capacity in the industry which led to increasing price competition and generally decreasing margins. Revenue decreases in our brand named nutritional products also contributed to lower gross profit in 2005 than 2004. Gross profit from our professional diagnostic products increased by $12.2 million, or 24%, comparing 2005 to 2004, principally as a result of gross profit earned on revenues from acquired businesses, as discussed above. Reducing gross margin for 2005 were a charge of $2.4 million associated with a reserve established during the second quarter of 2005 at our Wampole subsidiary for excess quantities of certain raw materials and finished goods, including certain finished goods held at distributors but subject to rights of return, and a $1.6 million provision for returns and inventory reserve which were established as a result of our recall of the drugs of abuse diagnostic products during the first quarter of 2005. Excluding these charges, gross profit from our professional diagnostic products segment increased by $16.2 million comparing 2005 to 2004. Gross margin from our professional diagnostic product sales was 37% in 2005, compared to 39% in 2004. Excluding the $2.4 million Wampole inventory reserve and the $1.6 million drugs of abuse charge discussed above, gross margin from our professional diagnostic product sales was 39% for 2005. Research and Development Expense. Research and development expense decreased by $1.0 million, or 3%, to $31.0 million in 2005 from $32.0 million in 2004. Research and development expense in 2005 is reported net of co-development funding of $17.2 million arising from the co-development funding arrangement that we entered into with ITI Scotland in February 2005. Research and development expense before considering the co-development funding was $48.2 million in 2005, an increase of $16.2 million from 2004. The increase in spending resulted in part from expenditures of $5.0 million in our professional diagnostics business associated with our acquisitions of Binax, BioStar and Ischemia. The remaining research and development spending primarily related to our continued significant investment in the development of products in the field of cardiology. Sales and Marketing Expense. Sales and marketing expense increased by $14.1 million, or 24%, to $72.1 million in 2005 from $58.0 million in 2004. Acquisitions completed during 2005 accounted for $8.3 million of the increase. Approximately $1.8 million of the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted from our increased advertising efforts to promote our premium consumer diagnostic products in 2005. The remaining increase in sales and marketing expense resulted from our expanded sales and marketing infrastructure to support the anticipated growth in our professional diagnostics business. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net product sales increased to 18% in 2005 from 16% in 2004. The increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net product sales primarily resulted from our investment in advertising efforts for our premium consumer diagnostic products and sales and marketing infrastructure to support our anticipated growth in the professional diagnostics business. 33 General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense increased by $7.3 million, or 14%, to $60.0 million in 2005 from $52.7 million in 2004. Acquisitions completed during 2005 accounted for $4.2 million of the increase. The remaining increase in general and administrative expense resulted from an increase in consulting and legal spending, due to the formal order of investigation in connection with the previously disclosed revenue recognition matter at Wampole and our active pursuits and defenses in litigations, including our lawsuits and settlements with Quidel and Princeton BioMeditech Corporation, or PBM. General and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was consistent in 2005 and 2004 at 14%. Interest Expense. Interest expense includes interest charges, the write-off and amortization of deferred financing costs and the amortization of non-cash discounts associated with our debt issuances in 2004, and the change in market value of our interest rate swap agreement of $0.7 million which did not qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes. Interest expense decreased by $0.3 million, or 1%, to $21.8 million in 2005 from $22.1 million in 2004. In 2004, we recorded a charge of $3.8 million representing the write-off of deferred financing costs and prepayment fees and penalties related to the repayment of borrowings under our primary senior credit facility and certain subordinated notes with the proceeds from our $150.0 million bond offering in February 2004. Excluding such charge, interest expense increased $3.5 million in 2005. Such increase was primarily due to a higher average outstanding debt balance which was $215.3 million during 2005, compared to $194.4 million during 2004, primarily as a result of the borrowings to finance various acquisitions and operations, offset in part by funds raised from our sale of common stock in August 2005. Additionally, the 8.75% interest rate on the $150.0 million bonds, together with its 50 basis points interest penalty during a portion of the first quarter of 2005 due to the late registration of the related exchange offer, coupled with the impact of the increase in short-term interest rates which effected the borrowings under our senior credit facility, increased our average cash interest rate to 9.0% for 2005 from 8.8% for 2004. The bonds, which are due in 2012, provide us with a long-term fixed rate on a significant portion of our indebtedness, as compared to the variable rates under our senior credit facility. Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, includes interest income, realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses, and other income and expense. The components and the respective amounts of other income (expense), net, are summarized as follows: (in thousands) 2005 2004 Interest income $ 1,035 $ 1,050 Foreign exchange (losses) gains, net (340 ) (720 ) Other 19,483 3,077 Total other income (expense), net $ 20,178 $ 3,407 Included in other income (expense), net, for 2005 are the following items: (i) $15.0 million in income, being the portion of our settlement with Quidel relating to periods prior to 2005, (ii) an $8.4 million gain from a legal settlement of class action suit against several raw material suppliers in our vitamins and nutritional supplements business (iii) $2.6 million of income related to the value of an option received under a licensing arrangement, (iv) a $2.7 million charge related to a legal settlement of a nutritional segment commercial dispute arising from a distribution arrangement entered into in September 1996, and (v) a $4.3 million charge related to a legal settlement with PBM. Included in other income (expense), net, for 2004 are the following items: (i) $0.5 million of royalties received attributable to periods prior to 2004 associated with a license arrangement that had historically been underpaid, (ii) $0.9 million in release of a pre-acquisition legal contingency reserve upon reaching and signing a settlement agreement, and (iii) $0.5 million in litigation settlement gain. 34 Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes increased by $4.5 million, or 200%, to $6.8 million in 2005 from $2.3 million in 2004. The effective tax rate in 2005 was (55)%, compared to (16)% in 2004. The increase in the provision for income taxes from 2004 to 2005 is primarily related to taxes on foreign income. The primary components of the 2005 provision for income taxes related to the recognition of U.S. deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences between the book and tax bases of goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives and to taxes on foreign income. The amount related to the U.S. deferred tax liabilities is approximately $2.9 million. In 2004, we recognized $0.8 million of benefit from the reduction of the valuation allowance related to net operating loss, or NOL, carryforward of two of our foreign subsidiaries due to our assessment that we would more likely than not realize the benefit of these NOLs. Net (Loss) Income. We incurred a net loss of $19.2 million in 2005, while we incurred a net loss of $16.6 million in 2004. After taking into account charges for redemption interest and amortization of a beneficial conversion feature related to our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, we had a net loss available to common stockholders of $17.3 million in 2004. Net loss per common share available to common stockholders was $0.79 per basic and diluted common share in 2005 as compared to net loss of $0.87 per basic and diluted common share in 2004. The net loss in 2005 and 2004 resulted from the various factors as discussed above. See Note 12 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the calculation of net (loss) income per share. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net Product Sales. Net product sales increased by $80.0 million, or 28%, to $365.4 million in 2004 from $285.4 million in 2003. Excluding the favorable impact of currency translation, net product sales in 2004 grew by approximately $69.6 million, or 24%, over 2003. A significant portion of the revenue increase resulted from our acquisitions in 2003 and 2004: (i) ABI contributed $14.0 million of such increase, (ii) the rapid diagnostics business of Abbott contributed $28.1 million, and (iii) various less significant acquisitions contributed an aggregate of $5.6 million of such increase. The remaining currency adjusted net product sales increase of $21.9 million resulted from our organic growth, primarily due to the launch of our Clearblue Easy Digital pregnancy test in June 2003, the commencement of our supply of the digital version of Pfizer's e.p.t pregnancy test in December 2003 and the visual version of Pfizer's e.p.t pregnancy test in June 2004 and the launch of our Clearblue Easy Digital ovulation test in June 2004. Net Product Sales by Business Segment. Net product sales by business segment for 2004 and 2003 are as follows: 2004 2003 % Increase (in thousands) (restated) (restated) Consumer diagnostic products $ 158,706 $ 127,056 25 % Vitamins and nutritional supplements 77,923 71,637 9 % Professional diagnostic products 128,803 86,737 49 % Total net product sales $ 365,432 $ 285,430 28 % 35 The currency adjusted increase in net product sales from our consumer diagnostic products was $23.6 million, or 19%, comparing 2004 to 2003. Of the currency adjusted increase, $1.2 million and $7.6 million resulted from the acquisition of ABI and Abbott's Fact plus line of consumer diagnostic pregnancy tests, respectively. The remaining currency adjusted increase of $14.8 million resulted from our organic growth, primarily due to the launch of our Clearblue Easy Digital pregnancy test in June 2003, the commencement of our supply of the digital version of Pfizer's e.p.t pregnancy test in December 2003 and the visual version of Pfizer's e.p.t pregnancy test in June 2004, and the launch of our Clearblue Easy Digital ovulation test in June 2004. Net product sales of our vitamins and nutritional supplements increased by $6.3 million, or 9%, comparing 2004 to 2003. The increase was primarily in our private label nutritional supplements sales. The currency adjusted increase in net product sales from our professional diagnostic products was $39.7 million, or 46%, comparing 2004 to 2003. Of the currency adjusted increase, $12.8 million resulted from the acquisition of ABI, $20.5 million resulted from the acquisition of the Abbott Testpack and Signify product lines and an aggregate of $5.6 million resulted from various less significant acquisitions. The remaining currency adjusted increase of $0.8 million resulted from our organic growth, primarily due to increased sales of our rapid diagnostic tests for the point of care market. Net Product Sales by Geographic Location. Net product sales by geographic location for 2004 and 2003 are as follows: 2004 2003 % Increase (in thousands) (restated) (restated) United States $ 218,251 $ 181,026 21 % Europe 98,136 69,594 41 % Other 49,045 34,810 41 % Total net product sales $ 365,432 $ 285,430 28 % The growth in our US business resulted primarily from the full year effect of the 2003 acquisitions of ABI and the portion of the Abbott rapid diagnostic business distributed in the US, as well as the launch of our Clearblue Easy Digital pregnancy test in June 2003, the commencement of our supply of the digital version of Pfizer's e.p.t pregnancy test in December 2003 and the visual version of Pfizer's e.p.t pregnancy test in June 2004, and the launch of our Clearblue Easy Digital ovulation test in June 2004. Our growth in Europe and the rest of the world was primarily attributable to the portion of the Abbott rapid diagnostic business distributed in each geography, as well as, with respect to Europe, the sales contributions from various less significant acquisitions. License and Royalty Revenue. License and royalty revenue represents license and royalty fees from intellectual property license agreements with third-parties. License revenue decreased by $1.1 million, or 11%, to $8.6 million in 2004 from $9.7 million in 2003. The decrease is a function of the net results of royalties collected under new licenses and a decrease in royalties under expired licenses. Gross Profit and Margin. Gross profit increased by $19.5 million, or 15%, to $147.0 million in 2004 from $127.5 million in 2003. Included in cost of sales in 2004 was a $1.7 million restructuring charge covering all costs for severance, early retirement and outplacement services arising from a completed plan of termination at our manufacturing facility in Bedford, England. The total number of involuntarily terminated employees was 18, all of whom were terminated as of December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2004, substantially all restructuring costs were paid. Excluding this charge, gross profit increased by $21.2 million, or 17%, comparing 2004 to 2003. 36 The gross profit increase of $21.2 million, comparing 2004 to 2003 and adjusted for the restructuring charge, as discussed above, primarily resulted from the businesses that we acquired in the second half of 2003. The acquisition of ABI contributed $4.3 million of such gross profit increase. The rapid diagnostics business we acquired from Abbott contributed $15.6 million of such gross profit increase and its gross margin increased to 51% in 2004 from 39% in 2003 as a result of our transitioning the manufacturing of a portion of the Signify and Fact plus products from a third-party manufacturer to our own manufacturing facility. The increased profitability arising from our transition of production of Signify to our own manufacturing is attributable to synergies that we expected to benefit from when we acquired the Abbott rapid diagnostics business. The remaining increase of $1.3 million in our gross profit, adjusted for the restructuring charge, as discussed above, was primarily a result of the launch of our Clearblue Easy Digital pregnancy and ovulation tests and the commencement of our supply of the Pfizer e.p.t products, offset by declining profits from our nutritional supplements business. Gross profit from our nutritional supplements business, principally the private label products, declined by $5.8 million, comparing 2004 to 2003, while its sales increased by $6.3 million. Our private label nutritional supplements business has suffered from excess capacity in the industry which has led to increased price competition. Overall gross margin was 39% in 2004, compared to 43% in 2003. The restructuring charge, as discussed above, had the effect of reducing gross margin by 46 basis points in 2004. Gross margin was also adversely impacted in 2004 by the continuing weak U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pounds Sterling. Such movements in foreign exchange currencies negatively impacted the gross margin percentage of our products manufactured at our European subsidiaries and sold in U.S. Dollars. This currency impact had the effect of reducing gross margins by 177 basis points, comparing 2004 to 2003. Further, as discussed above, due to competitive pricing in the nutritional supplements business, gross margin from our nutritional supplements sales, principally in our private label products, has declined significantly. Comparing 2004 to 2003, the margin erosion of the nutritional supplements business affected our overall gross margin by 188 basis points. Somewhat offsetting the negative impact on gross margin was the improved gross margin of the rapid diagnostic products of Abbott, as discussed above. Gross Profit from Net Product Sales by Business Segment. Gross profit from net product sales represents total gross profits less gross profit associated with license revenue. Gross profit from total net product sales increased by $20.7 million, or 17%, to $141.8 million in 2004 from $121.1 million in 2003. Gross profit from net product sales by business segment for 2004 and 2003 are as follows: 2004 2003 % Increase/ (decrease) (in thousands) (restated) Consumer diagnostic products $ 82,909 $ 70,910 17 % Vitamins and nutritional supplements 8,775 14,577 (40 )% Professional diagnostic products 50,079 35,562 41 % Total gross profit from net product sales $ 141,763 $ 121,049 17 % Gross profit from our consumer diagnostic product sales increased by $12.0 million, or 17%, comparing 2004 to 2003. Of the increase in gross profit from our consumer diagnostic product sales, $4.0 million resulted from our acquisition of the Fact plus line of consumer diagnostic pregnancy tests from Abbott in September 2003. Organic growth, primarily as a result of the launch of our Clearblue Easy Digital pregnancy and ovulation tests and the commencement of our supply of the e.p.t pregnancy tests to Pfizer, contributed to the remaining increase in our gross profit from our consumer diagnostic product sales. Gross margin from our consumer diagnostic product sales was 52% in 2004, compared to 56% in 2003. The restructuring charge, as discussed above, had the effect of reducing gross margin from our 37 consumer diagnostic product sales by 109 basis points, comparing 2004 to 2003. The movements in foreign currencies, comparing 2004 to 2003, negatively impacted gross margin by 416 basis points for our consumer diagnostic products manufactured at our European subsidiaries and sold in U.S. Dollars. The negative margin impact of the restructuring charge and foreign currency movements was offset in part by the sales of our digital pregnancy tests, which, as state-of-the-art, first-to-market products are able to generate higher gross profit per unit sold than traditional pregnancy tests. Despite sales increase, as discussed above, gross profit from our nutritional supplements business, principally the private label products, declined by $5.8 million, or 40%, comparing 2004 to 2003, as a result of margin erosion due to pricing competition. This was evident by its gross margin of 11% in 2004, compared to 20% in 2003. The increase in gross profit from our professional diagnostic product sales of $14.5 million, comparing 2004 to 2003, primarily resulted from our acquisitions of the Abbott TestPack and Signify product lines and ABI. The Abbott professional diagnostic products contributed $11.7 million of the increase in gross profit, comparing 2004 to 2003. The acquisition of ABI contributed $4.3 million of the increase in gross profit from our professional diagnostic product sales. Gross margin from our professional diagnostic product sales was 39% in 2004, compared to 41% in 2003. The decline in gross margin of our professional diagnostic products primarily resulted from the ABI products which on average have been generating lower margins than our other professional diagnostic products. Research and Development Expense. Research and development expense increased by $7.7 million, or 32%, to $32.0 million in 2004 from $24.3 million in 2003. A significant portion of our research and development spending occurs at our facilities in the United Kingdom. As a result, the weak U.S. Dollar against the British Pounds Sterling causes an increase in the dollar value of research and development expense at translation. Adjusted for the unfavorable impact of currency translation, research and development expense increased by $5.2 million, or 21%, when comparing 2004 to 2003. Our acquisition of ABI, primarily in the field of professional diagnostic testing, contributed $1.6 million of the currency adjusted increase in research and development expense. The remaining increase in research and development expense, comparing 2004 to 2003, resulted from an increase in our cardiology research and development expenditures from $11.3 million in 2003 to $17.9 million in 2004 (an increase of $4.7 million on a currency adjusted basis). Sales and Marketing Expense. Sales and marketing expense increased by $5.5 million, or 10%, to $58.0 million in 2004 from $52.5 million in 2003. A significant portion of our sales and marketing spending takes place at our European subsidiaries. Accordingly, and as a result of the continued weak U.S. Dollar, the currency adjusted increase in sales and marketing expense, comparing 2004 to 2003, was $3.1 million, or 6%. Of the currency adjusted increase in sales and marketing expense, $2.4 million resulted from the amortization of customer related intangible assets which we acquired as part of our acquisition of the rapid diagnostics business of Abbott. The remaining currency adjusted increase in sales and marketing expense of $0.7 million resulted from our acquisition of ABI. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net product sales decreased to 16% in 2004, from 18% in 2003. The percentage decrease primarily resulted from the shift to our professional diagnostics business which generally incurs lower sales and marketing expense as a percentage of sales from our vitamins and nutritional supplements business. In addition, marketing synergies realized due to our integration of the Fact plus product line acquired from Abbott with only nominal increases in consumer sales and marketing infrastructure accounted for approximately 34 basis points of the reduction in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of sales from 2003 to 2004. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense increased by $17.2 million, or 48%, to $52.7 million in 2004 from $35.5 million in 2003. Excluding the impact of 38 foreign currency translation, general and administrative expense increased $15.6 million, or 44%, when comparing 2004 to 2003. Included in general and administrative expense for 2004 was the establishment of a specific reserve for a doubtful accounts receivable balance of $1.4 million. Legal expenses in 2004 increased by $4.0 million, compared to 2003, due to our active pursuits and defenses in litigations, primarily related to intellectual property infringements. Our acquisitions since June 2003 contributed an additional $6.6 million to general and administrative expenses in 2004, compared to 2003. In 2004, we also spent an additional $1.7 million in audit and consulting costs associated with our preparation for compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Rule 404 regarding internal control over financial reporting. The remaining currency adjusted increase of $1.9 million in general and administrative expense from 2003 to 2004 resulted from investments in our infrastructure to support the growth of our business. For the factors discussed herein, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue increased to 14% in 2004 from 12% in 2003. Interest Expense. Interest expense includes interest charges, the write-off and amortization of deferred financing costs and the amortization of non-cash discounts associated with our debt issuances and the change in market value of our interest rate swap agreement which did not qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes. Interest expense increased by $12.4 million, or 128%, to $22.1 million in 2004 from $9.7 million in 2003. In 2004, we recorded a charge of $3.8 million representing the write-off of deferred financing costs and prepayment fees and penalties related to the repayment of borrowings under our primary senior credit facility and certain subordinated notes with the proceeds from our $150.0 million bond offering in February 2004. Excluding such charge, interest expense increased by $8.6 million, comparing 2004 to 2003. Such increase was primarily due to a higher average outstanding debt balance which was $194.4 million during 2004, compared to $140.4 million during 2003, primarily as a result of the borrowings to finance the acquisitions of ABI and the rapid diagnostics business from Abbott in the second half of 2003. Additionally, the 8.75% interest rate on the $150.0 million bonds increased our average cash interest rate to 8.8% as of December 31, 2004, compared to 6.1% as of December 31, 2003. The bonds, which are due in 2012, provide us with a long-term fixed rate on a significant portion of our indebtedness, as compared to the variable rates under our senior credit facilities. Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, includes interest income, realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses, and other income and expense. The components and the respective amounts of other income (expense), net, are summarized as follows: (in thousands) 2004 2003 Interest income $ 1,050 $ 1,043 Foreign exchange (losses) gains, net (720 ) 5 Other 3,077 5,393 Total other income (expense), net $ 3,407 $ 6,441 The foreign exchange loss of $0.7 million in 2004 primarily resulted from the continuing weakening U.S. Dollar against the British Pounds Sterling and the Euro, as certain receivables of our Irish and U.K. subsidiaries are denominated in U.S. Dollar while their functional currency is their respective local currency. Included in other income for 2004 are the following items: (i) $0.5 million of royalties received attributable to periods prior to 2004 associated with a license arrangement that had historically been underpaid, (ii) $0.9 million in release of a pre-acquisition legal contingency reserve upon reaching and signing a settlement agreement, and (iii) $0.5 million in litigation settlement gain. Included in other income for 2003 is $1.2 million of past royalties received as part of a patent infringement settlement and a one-time gain of $3.8 million recorded in connection with an agreement with Unilever Plc (the 39 seller of the Unipath business) which resolved certain issues that arose out of our acquisition of the Unipath business. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased by $0.6 million, or 21%, to $2.3 million in 2004 from $2.9 million in 2003. The effective tax rate in 2004 was (16)%, compared to 25% in 2003. The decrease in the provision for income taxes from 2003 to 2004 related to the recognition and benefit of certain current year losses and certain deferred tax assets. In 2004, we recognized $0.8 million of benefit from the reduction of the valuation allowance related to net operating loss, or NOL, carryforward of two of our foreign subsidiaries due to our assessment that we would more likely than not realize the benefit of these NOLs. The primary component of the 2004 provision for income taxes related to the recognition of a U.S. deferred tax liability for temporary differences between the book and tax bases of goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives. Net (Loss) Income. We incurred a net loss of $16.6 million in 2004, while we generated net income of $8.7 million in 2003. After taking into account charges for redemption interest and amortization of a beneficial conversion feature related to our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, we had a net loss available to common stockholders of $17.3 million, or $0.87 per basic and diluted common share, in 2004, compared to net income available to common stockholders of $7.7 million, or $0.49 and $0.44 per basic and diluted common share, respectively, in 2003. The net loss in 2004 and net income in 2003 primarily resulted from the various factors as discussed above. See Note 12 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the calculation of net (loss) income per share. Liquidity and Capital Resources Based upon our current working capital position, current operating plans and expected business conditions, we believe that our existing capital resources, credit facilities, expected funding resulting from our co-development funding agreement with ITI Scotland and the proceeds from our February 2006 equity offering will be adequate to fund our operations, including our outstanding debt and other commitments, as discussed below, for the next 12 months. In the long run, we expect to fund our working capital needs and other commitments primarily through the co-development funding program with ITI Scotland and through our operating cash flow, since we expect to grow our business through new product introductions and by continuing to leverage our strong intellectual property position. We also expect to rely on our credit facilities and the capital markets to fund a portion of our capital needs and other commitments. Our funding plans for our working capital needs and other commitments may be adversely impacted by unexpected costs associated with prosecuting and defending our existing lawsuits and/or unforeseen lawsuits against us, integrating the operations of Ischemia, Binax, BioStar, IDT and the Determine business and executing our cost savings strategies. We also cannot be certain that our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will be realized. In addition, we intend to continue to make significant investments in our research and development efforts related to the substantial intellectual property portfolio we own. We may also choose to further expand our research and development efforts and may pursue the acquisition of new products and technologies through licensing arrangements, business acquisitions, or otherwise. We may also choose to make significant investment to pursue legal remedies against potential infringers of our intellectual property. If we decide to engage in such activities, or if our operating results fail to meet our expectations, we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financings or other arrangements. In such event, adequate funds may not be available when needed, or, may be available only on terms which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible securities, dilution to then existing stockholders may result. 40 Changes in Cash Position As of December 31, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalents of $34.3 million, a $17.5 million increase, or 105%, from December 31, 2004. Since our split-off from our former parent company in November 2001, we have funded our business through operating cash flows, proceeds from borrowings and the issuance of equity securities. During 2005, we generated cash of $26.6 million from our operating activities, which resulted from a net loss of $19.2 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $36.0 million and a net working capital increase, excluding the change in cash balance and adjusted for acquired assets, of $9.8 million. The increase in adjusted working capital primarily resulted from an increase in our inventory and prepaid assets, offset by a decrease in accounts receivable. A net payment of $17.0 million from Quidel under an infringement litigation settlement is included in our net loss for 2005. Our non-equity financing activities, primarily borrowings under our primary senior credit facility, net of various debt repayments and financing costs, provided us with cash of $66.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. In addition, we received $97.4 million in net proceeds from an equity offering and the exercises of common stock options during the year ended December 31, 2005. In 2005, we used cash of $170.8 million for investing activities which consisted of $149.0 million paid for transaction costs associated with previously acquired businesses and the 2005 acquisitions of ACS, Ischemia, Binax, the Determine business, BioStar and IDT. Additionally, we used cash to fund $20.0 million in capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of equipment and a $1.8 million increase in other non-current assets. Fluctuations in foreign currencies negatively impacted our cash balance by $2.1 million in 2005. Investing Activities During the year ended December 31, 2005, we incurred $20.0 million in capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of equipment. Significant capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2005 included: $1.9 million in connection with upgrading one of our vitamins and nutritional supplements plants and machinery; $0.9 million in connection with the transition of the manufacturing of the TestPack product, which we acquired as part of the rapid diagnostics business from Abbott, to our facilities, $2.0 million related to equipment in support of our research and development efforts at our facility in Stirling, Scotland, and $1.4 million in connection with our manufacturing facility in Bedford, England related to expansion of our production capabilities. The remaining capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 were incurred for the purchase of additional or replacement equipment to support our organic growth and various research and development activities and to furnish our new facility in China. On January 24, 2005, we acquired the consumer pregnancy test business of ACS for an aggregate purchase price of $4.9 million which consisted of $4.6 million in cash and $0.3 million in estimated direct acquisition costs. In acquiring the business, we obtained the rights to the Crystal Clear brand. Crystal Clear is the leading consumer pregnancy test in Australia and has a leading position in New Zealand. On March 16, 2005, we acquired Ischemia, a privately held, venture-backed company that developed, manufactured and marketed the only FDA-cleared in vitro diagnostic test targeted on cardiac ischemia. The aggregate purchase price was $27.2 million, which consisted of 968,000 shares of our common stock with an aggregate fair value of $22.8 million, estimated exit costs of $1.5 million to vacate Ischemia's manufacturing and administrative facilities, estimated direct acquisition costs of $2.4 million and $0.5 million in assumed debt. On March 31, 2005, we acquired Binax, a privately held developer, manufacturer and distributor of rapid diagnostic products for infectious disease testing, primarily related to the respiratory system. The aggregate purchase price was $44.7 million, which consisted of $9.0 million in cash, 1,422,000 shares of our common stock with an aggregate fair value of $35.2 million and $0.5 million in estimated direct 41 acquisition costs. The terms of the acquisition agreement also provide for $11.0 million of contingent cash consideration payable to the Binax shareholders upon the successful completion of certain new product developments during the five years following the acquisition. On June 30, 2005, we acquired the Determine business. The Determine business produces diagnostic tests that are designed to provide rapid qualitative results for detecting several diseases, including hepatitis, HIV 1/2 and syphilis. The aggregate purchase price was $58.1 million, which consisted of $56.5 million in cash and $1.6 million in estimated direct acquisition costs. On September 30, 2005, we acquired IDT, a Spanish distributor of diagnostic products. The aggregate purchase price was $20.3 million, which consisted of $11.7 million in cash, an $8.4 million working capital adjustment, which was paid during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, and $0.2 million in estimated direct acquisition costs. On September 30, 2005, we acquired BioStar, a leading developer and manufacturer of high-performance, rapid diagnostic tests, including tests for the detection of infectious diseases. The aggregate purchase price was $53.7 million, which consisted of $53.1 million in cash, $0.5 million in estimated direct acquisition costs and $0.1 million in estimated exit costs. Financing Activities On February 10, 2004, we completed the sale of $150.0 million of 8.75% senior subordinated notes, or bonds, due 2012 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. The proceeds from the bond issuance were used to repay certain of our then existing debt and provided us with additional funds for our operations. These bonds accrue interest from the date of their issuance, or February 10, 2004, at the rate of 8.75% per year. Interest on the bonds are payable semi-annually in arrears on each February 15 and August 15, which commenced on August 15, 2004. As we were unable to consummate the exchange offer until March 28, 2005, interest on the bonds increased by 0.25% point per year for the first 90-day period immediately following the default and an additional 0.25% point per year with respect to each subsequent 90-day period up to a maximum amount of additional interest of 1% point. As of December 31, 2005, accrued interest related to the bonds amounted to $5.4 million. The bonds are unsecured and are subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt, including our guarantee of all borrowings under our primary senior credit facility. The bonds are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities, including trade payables, of those of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the bonds. The bonds are guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries that are guarantors or borrowers under our primary senior credit facility. The guarantees are general unsecured obligations of the guarantors and are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior debt of the applicable guarantors, which includes their guarantees of, and borrowings under our primary senior credit facility. In August 2005, we sold 4,000,000 shares of common stock to funds affiliated with 3 accredited institutional investors in a private placement. Net proceeds from the private placement were approximately $92.8 million. Of this amount, we repaid principal and interest outstanding under our senior credit facility of $84.4 million, with the remainder of the net proceeds retained for general corporate purposes. $20.0 million of the repayment was used to permanently reduce the outstanding term loan balance under the senior credit facility. On February 8 and 9, 2006, we sold 3,400,000 shares of our common stock at $24.41 per share to funds affiliated with 14 accredited institutional investors in a private placement. Proceeds from the private placement were approximately $79.3 million, net of issuance costs of $3.7 million. Of this amount, we repaid principal and interest outstanding under our senior credit facility of $74.1 million, with the remainder of the net proceeds retained for general corporate purposes. 42 On February 28, 2006, we acquired 67.45% of the capital stock of CLONDIAG chip technologies GmbH, a private company located in Jena in Germany which has developed a multiplexing technology for nucleic acid and immunoassay based diagnostics, in exchange for 218,502 shares of our common stock and approximately $3.1 million in cash. We also agreed to settle obligations totaling approximately $10.0 million during the first quarter of 2006, primarily using cash. Under our agreement with the CLONDIAG shareholders, we will acquire the remaining 32.55% of the capital stock of CLONDIAG on or about August 31, 2006 for an additional $4.9 million based on current exchange rates. The agreement also calls for contingent consideration totaling approximately $8.9 million consisting of 224,316 shares of common stock and approximately $3.0 million of cash or stock in the event that four specified products are developed on CLONDIAG's platform technology during the three years following the date of the initial stock purchase. Our primary senior credit facility with a group of banks, as amended, currently provides us with revolving lines of credit in the aggregate amount of up to $100.0 million, subject to continuing covenant compliance. As of December 31, 2005, we had $89.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving lines of credit. $73.6 million of the outstanding debt was used to fund the acquisitions of BioStar and IDT. We may repay any future borrowings under the revolving lines of credit at any time but in no event later than March 31, 2008. We are required to make mandatory prepayments under our primary senior credit facility if we meet certain cash flow thresholds, issue equity securities or subordinated debt, or sell assets not in the ordinary course of our business above certain thresholds. Borrowings under the revolving lines of credit bear interest at either (1) the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, as defined in the credit agreement, plus applicable margins or, at our option, (2) a floating Index Rate, as defined in the credit agreement, plus applicable margins. Applicable margins if we choose to use the LIBOR or the Index Rate can range from 2.75% to 3.75% or 1.50% to 2.50%, respectively, depending on the quarterly adjustments that are based on our consolidated financial performance. As of December 31, 2005, the applicable interest rate under the revolving lines of credit, including the applicable margin, ranged from 6.84% to 9.25%. Borrowings under our primary senior credit facility are secured by the stock of our U.S. and European subsidiaries, substantially all of our intellectual property rights and the assets of our businesses in the U.S. and Europe, excluding those assets of Orgenics Ltd., our Israeli subsidiary, Inverness Medical Shanghai Co., Ltd., our subsidiary in China, Inverness Medical Australia Pty. Ltd., our Australian subsidiary, and Unipath Scandinavia AB, our Swedish subsidiary, and the stock of Orgenics and certain smaller subsidiaries. Under the senior credit agreement, as amended, we must comply with various financial and non-financial covenants. The primary financial covenants pertain to, among other things, fixed charge coverage ratio, capital expenditures, various leverage ratios, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and a minimum cash requirement. Additionally, the senior credit agreement currently prohibits us from paying dividends. We are currently in compliance with the covenants, as amended. On September 20, 2002, we sold units having an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million to private investors to help finance our acquisition of Wampole Laboratories. The 10% subordinated notes accrue interest on the outstanding principal amount at 10% per annum, which is payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of each calendar quarter, which started on October 1, 2002. The 10% subordinated notes mature on September 20, 2008, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances, and we may prepay the 10% subordinated notes at any time, subject to certain prepayment penalties and the consent of our senior lenders. The 10% subordinated notes are expressly subordinated to up to $150.0 million of indebtedness for borrowed money incurred or guaranteed by our company plus any other indebtedness that we incur to finance or refinance an acquisition. 43 As of December 31, 2005, we had an aggregate of $1.7 million in outstanding capital lease obligations which are payable through 2009. Income Taxes As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $170.2 million and $26.0 million of domestic and foreign net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards, respectively, which either expire on various dates through 2025 or can be carried forward indefinitely. The NOL carryforward for CDIL is approximately $14.7 million. The CDIL NOL is fully reserved and may never be realized, due to the closing of the facility. These losses are available to reduce federal and foreign taxable income, if any, in future years. These losses are also subject to review and possible adjustments by the applicable taxing authorities. In addition, the domestic operating loss carryforward amount at December 31, 2005 included approximately $71.2 million of pre-acquisition losses at IMN, Ischemia, Ostex and ADC. The future benefit of these losses will be applied first to reduce to zero any goodwill and other non-current intangible assets related to the acquisitions, prior to reducing our income tax expense. Also included in our domestic NOL carryforwards at December 31, 2005 was approximately $2.6 million resulting from the exercise of employee stock options, the tax benefit of which, when recognized, will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid-in capital rather than a reduction of income tax. Furthermore, all domestic losses are subject to the Internal Revenue Service Code Section 382 limitation and may be limited in the event of certain cumulative changes in ownership interests of significant shareholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%. Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the use of these losses to an amount equal to the value of the company at the time of the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate. We have recorded a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses and certain of our other deferred tax assets to reflect uncertainties that might affect the realization of such deferred tax assets, as these assets can only be realized via profitable operations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2005. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods.

Critical Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The accounting policies discussed below are considered by our management and our audit committee to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application depends on management's judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. In addition, the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include a comprehensive summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition We primarily recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (3) the fee is fixed and determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. The majority of our revenues are derived from product sales. We recognize revenue upon title transfer of the products to third-party customers, less a reserve for estimated product returns and allowances. Determination of the reserve for estimated product returns and allowances is based on our management's analyses and judgments regarding certain conditions, as discussed below in the critical accounting policy "Use of Estimates for Sales Returns and Other Allowances and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts." Should future changes in conditions prove management's conclusions and judgments on previous analyses to be incorrect, revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected. In connection with the acquisitions of the rapid diagnostics business in September 2003 and the Determine business in June 2005 from Abbott, we entered into a transition services agreement with Abbott, whereby Abbott would continue to distribute certain of the acquired products for a period of up to 18 months following each acquisition. During the transition period, we recognized revenue on sales of the products when title transferred from Abbott to third party customers. We also receive license and royalty revenue from agreements with third-party licensees. Revenue from fixed fee license and royalty agreements are recognized on a straight-line basis over the obligation period of the related license agreements. License and royalty fees that the licensees calculate based on their sales, which we have the right to audit under most of our agreements, are generally recognized upon receipt of the license or royalty payments unless we are able to reasonably estimate the fees as they are earned. License and royalty fees that are determinable prior to the receipt thereof are recognized in the period they are earned. 45 Use of Estimates for Sales Returns and Other Allowances and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Certain sales arrangements require us to accept product returns. From time to time, we also enter into sales incentive arrangements with our retail customers, which generally reduce the sale prices of our products. As a result, we must establish allowances for potential future product returns and claims resulting from our sales incentive arrangements against product revenue recognized in any reporting period. Calculation of these allowances requires significant judgments and estimates. When evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances, our management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends, and changes in customer and consumer demand and acceptance of our products. When such analysis is not available and a right of return exists, we record revenue when the right of return is no longer applicable. Material differences in the amount and timing of our product revenue for any reporting period may result if changes in conditions arise that would require management to make different judgments or utilize different estimates. Our total provision for sales returns and other allowances related to sales incentive arrangements amounted to $51.2 million, $55.2 million and $46.2 million, or 13%, 15% and 16% of net product sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which have been recorded against product sales to derive our net product sales. Similarly, our management must make estimates regarding uncollectible accounts receivable balances. When evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, management analyzes specific accounts receivable balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms and patterns. Our accounts receivable balance was $70.5 million and $61.3 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $9.7 million and $9.4 million, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Valuation of Inventories We state our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the estimated current market value of the inventory. In addition, we periodically review the inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory. This provision reduces the carrying value of our inventory and is calculated based primarily upon factors such as forecasts of our customers' demands, shelf lives of our products in inventory, loss of customers and manufacturing lead times. Evaluating these factors, particularly forecasting our customers' demands, requires management to make assumptions and estimates. Actual product sales may prove our forecasts to be inaccurate, in which case we may have underestimated or overestimated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. If, in future periods, our inventory is determined to be overvalued, we would be required to recognize the excess value as a charge to our cost of sales at the time of such determination. Likewise, if, in future periods, our inventory is determined to be undervalued, we would have over-reported our cost of sales, or understated our earnings, at the time we recorded the excess and obsolete provision. Our inventory balance was $71.2 million and $61.2 million, net of a provision for excess and obsolete inventory of $7.7 million and $4.1 million, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived and Intangible Assets Our long-lived assets include (1) property, plant and equipment, (2) goodwill and (3) other intangible assets. As of December 31, 2005, the balances of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, were $72.2 million, $322.2 million and $188.3 million, respectively. Goodwill and other intangible assets are initially created as a result of business combinations or acquisitions of intellectual property. The values we record for goodwill and other intangible assets represent fair values calculated by accepted valuation methods. Such valuations require us to provide 46 significant estimates and assumptions which are derived from information obtained from the management of the acquired businesses and our business plans for the acquired businesses or intellectual property. Critical estimates and assumptions used in the initial valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets include, but are not limited to: (i) future expected cash flows from product sales, customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents, (ii) expected costs to complete any in-process research and development projects and commercialize viable products and estimated cash flows from sales of such products, (iii) the acquired companies' brand awareness and market position, (iv) assumptions about the period of time over which we will continue to use the acquired brand, and (v) discount rates. These estimates and assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate because unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. If estimates and assumptions used to initially value goodwill and intangible assets prove to be inaccurate, ongoing reviews of the carrying values of such goodwill and intangible assets, as discussed below, may indicate impairment which will require us to record an impairment charge in the period in which we identify the impairment. Where we believe that property, plant and equipment and intangible assets have finite lives, we depreciate and amortize those assets over their estimated useful lives. For purposes of determining whether there are any impairment losses, as further discussed below, our management has historically examined the carrying value of our identifiable long-lived tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including their useful lives where we believe such assets have finite lives, when indicators of impairment are present. In addition, SFAS No. 142 requires that impairment reviews be performed on the carrying values of all goodwill on at least an annual basis. For all long-lived tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, if an impairment loss is identified based on the fair value of the asset, as compared to the carrying value of the asset, such loss would be charged to expense in the period we identify the impairment. Furthermore, if our review of the carrying values of the long-lived tangible and intangible assets with finite lives indicates impairment of such assets, we may determine that shorter estimated useful lives are more appropriate. In that event, we will be required to record additional depreciation and amortization in future periods, which will reduce our earnings. Valuation of Goodwill We have goodwill balances related to our consumer diagnostics and professional diagnostics reporting units, which amounted to $85.7 million and $236.5 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005. As of September 30, 2005, we performed our annual impairment review on the carrying values of such goodwill using the discounted cash flows approach. Based upon this review, we do not believe that the goodwill related to our consumer diagnostics and professional diagnostics reporting units were impaired. Because future cash flows and operating results used in the impairment review are based on management's projections and assumptions, future events can cause such projections to differ from those used at September 30, 2005, which could lead to significant impairment charges of goodwill in the future. No events or circumstances have occurred since our review as of September 30, 2005, that would require us to reassess whether the carrying values of our goodwill have been impaired. Valuation of Other Long-Lived Tangible and Intangible Assets Factors we generally consider important which could trigger an impairment review on the carrying value of other long-lived tangible and intangible assets include the following: (1) significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; (2) significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; (3) underutilization of our tangible assets; (4) discontinuance of product lines by ourselves or our customers; (5) significant negative industry or economic trends; (6) significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; (7) significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value; and (8) goodwill impairment identified during an impairment review under SFAS No. 142. Although we 47 believe that the carrying value of our long-lived tangible and intangible assets was realizable as of December 31, 2005, future events could cause us to conclude otherwise. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as reserves and accruals and lives assigned to long-lived and intangible assets, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we must include an expense within our tax provision. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $96.7 million as of December 31, 2005 due to uncertainties related to the future benefits, if any, from our deferred tax assets related primarily to our U.S. businesses and certain foreign net operating losses and tax credits. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reduce our current valuation allowance which could materially impact our tax provision. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we established reserves for tax contingencies that reflect our best estimate of the transactions and deductions that we may be unable to sustain or that we could be willing to concede as part of a broader tax settlement. We are currently undergoing routine tax examinations by various state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax authorities periodically challenge certain transactions and deductions we reported on our income tax returns. We do not expect the outcome of these examinations, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA contains a series of provisions, several of which are pertinent to our company. The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for U.S. multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. We did not repatriate any of our foreign earnings under this provision. It has been our company's practice to permanently reinvest all foreign earnings into foreign operations and we currently expect to continue to reinvest foreign earnings permanently into our foreign operations. Should we plan to repatriate any foreign earnings in the future, we will be required to establish an income tax expense and related tax liability on such earnings. Legal Contingencies In the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled "Item 3. Legal Proceedings," we have reported on material legal proceedings. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we may from time to time be subject to commercial disputes, consumer product claims or various other lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business, and we expect this will continue to be the case in the future. These lawsuits generally seek damages, sometimes in substantial amounts, for commercial or personal injuries allegedly suffered and can include claims for punitive or other special damages. In 48 addition, we aggressively defend our patent and other intellectual property rights. This often involves bringing infringement or other commercial claims against third parties, which can be expensive and can result in counterclaims against us. We do not accrue for potential losses on legal proceedings where our company is the defendant when we are not able to reasonably estimate our potential liability, if any, due to uncertainty as to the nature, extent and validity of the claims against us, uncertainty as to the nature and extent of the damages or other relief sought by the plaintiff and the complexity of the issues involved. Our potential liability, if any, in a particular case may become reasonably estimable and probable as the case progresses, in which case we will begin accruing for the expected loss. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections," which replaces ABP Opinion No. 20, "Accounting Changes," and FASB Statement No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements," and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date SFAS No. 154 was issued. At the present time, we do not believe that adoption of SFAS No. 154 will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations," which is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." The interpretation requires a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation be recognized if the fair value of the liability can be reasonable estimated. The interpretation is effective for years ending after December 15, 2005. The interpretation is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchange of Nonmonetary Assetsan amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions." SFAS No. 153 is based on the principle that exchange of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair market value of the assets exchanged. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the exception of nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS No. 153 and do not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which addresses the accounting for transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the company or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. It eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using APB Opinion No. 25, and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. As permitted by the current SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, we have been accounting for share-based compensation to employees using APB Opinion No. 25's intrinsic value method and, as such, we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options. Under the original guidance of SFAS No. 123R, we were to adopt the statement's provisions for the interim period beginning after June 15, 2005. However, in April 2005, as a result of an action by the Securities and Exchange 49 Commission, companies were allowed to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R at the beginning of their fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005. Consequently, we adopted SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006. If we had adopted this standard in 2005, our net loss for 2005 would have been $6.2 million (or $0.25 per diluted share) higher than reported in 2005. While we expect that the requirement to expense stock options and other equity interests that have been or will be granted pursuant to our equity incentive program will significantly increase our operating expenses and result in lower earnings per share, the amount of the increase in operating expenses will depend on the level of future grants, the terms and fair values of such grants, and expected volatilities, among other factors, present at the grant dates. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have no impact on our cash flows. In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costsan amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material should be recognized as current period charges in all circumstances. Additionally, SFAS No. 151 requires that a facility's fixed production overhead be charged to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facility. As required, we adopted SFAS No. 151 on January 1, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 151 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through our investing and financing activities. In addition, our ability to finance future acquisition transactions or fund working capital requirements may be impacted if we are not able to obtain appropriate financing at acceptable rates. Our investing strategy, to manage interest rate exposure, is to invest in short-term, highly liquid investments. Our investment policy also requires investment in approved instruments with an initial maximum allowable maturity of eighteen months and an average maturity of our portfolio that should not exceed six months, with at least $500,000 cash available at all times. Currently, our short-term investments are in money market funds with original maturities of 90 days or less. At December 31, 2005, our short-term investments approximated market value. At December 31, 2005, we had revolving lines of credit available to us of up to $100.0 million in the aggregate under our primary senior credit facility, against which $89.0 million was outstanding. We may repay any future borrowings under the revolving lines of credit at any time but in no event later than March 31, 2008. Borrowings under the revolving lines of credit bear interest at either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, as defined in the credit agreement, plus applicable margins or, at our option, (ii) a floating Index Rate, as defined in the agreement, plus applicable margins. Applicable margins if we choose to use the LIBOR or the Index Rate can range from 2.75% to 3.75% or 1.50% to 2.50%, respectively, depending on the quarterly adjustments that are based on our consolidated financial performance. 50 As of December 31, 2005, the LIBOR and Index rates applicable under our primary senior credit facility were 4.37% and 7.25%, respectively. Assuming no changes in our leverage ratio, which would affect the margin of the interest rate under the senior credit agreement, the effect of interest rate fluctuations on outstanding borrowings under the revolving lines of credit as of December 31, 2005 over the next twelve months is quantified and summarized as follows: (in thousands) Interest Expense Increase Interest rates increase by 1 basis point $ 890 Interest rates increase by 2 basis points $ 1,780 Foreign Currency Risk We face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates whenever we, or any of our subsidiaries, enter into transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our, or its, functional currency. Intercompany transactions between entities that use different functional currencies also expose us to foreign currency risk. During 2005, the net impact of foreign currency changes on transactions was a loss of $0.3 million. Historically, we have not used derivative financial instruments or other financial instruments with original maturities in excess of three months to hedge such economic exposures. However, during 2005 we entered into forward exchange contracts totaling $24.9 million with monthly maturity dates of January 18, 2005 to February 15, 2006. Maturing forward exchange contracts were used to lock in U.S. dollar to British Pound Sterling (GBP) or U.S. dollar to Euro exchange rates and hedge anticipated intercompany sales. The change in value of the derivative was analyzed quarterly for changes in the spot and forward rates based on rates given by the issuing financial institution for each quarter end date. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported in other comprehensive income ("OCI") during the period prior to the forecasted purchase or sale. For forecasted sales on credit, the amount of income ascribed to each forecasted period was reclassified from OCI to income or expense on the date of the sale. The income or cost ascribed to each period encompassed within the periods of the recognized foreign-currency- denominated receivable or payable was reclassified from OCI to income or expense at the end of each reporting period. The changes in the derivative instrument's fair values from inception of the hedge were compared to the cumulative change in the hedged item's fair value attributable to the risk hedged. Effectiveness was based on the change in the spot rates. At December 31, 2005, we had two forward exchange contracts outstanding for $1.5 million each against the GBP. The contracts maturing during January and February 2006 effectively hedge existing receivables and therefore are considered fair value hedges and accordingly, as of December 31, 2005, the forward contracts remain effective against future exchange rate changes. Gross margins of products we manufacture at our European plants and sell in U.S. dollar are also affected by foreign currency exchange rate movements. Our gross margin on total net product sales was 34.8% in 2005. If the U.S. dollar had been stronger by 1%, 5% or 10%, compared to the actual rates during 2005, our gross margin on total net product sales would have been 34.9%, 35.4% and 36.0%, respectively. In addition, because a substantial portion of our earnings is generated by our foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar (in which we report our consolidated financial results), our earnings could be materially impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates upon the translation of the earnings of such subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar had been stronger by 1%, 5% or 10%, compared to the actual average exchange rates used to 51 translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries, our net revenue and net income would have been lower by approximately the following amounts: (in thousands) Approximate decrease in net revenue Approximate increase in net loss If during 2005, the U.S. dollar was stronger by: 1% $ 1,277 $ 13 5% $ 6,385 $ 63 10% $ 12,770 $ 126 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The financial statements and supplementary data, except for selected quarterly financial data which are summarized below, are listed under Item 15.(a) and have been filed as part of this report on the pages indicated. As discussed on page 27 of Item 6. "Selected Consolidated Financial Data" and in Note 2(p) of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have previously restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the quarters therein and for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 to correct errors under GAAP relating to the recognition of revenue. We determined that certain customers of one of our diagnostics divisions were provided return or exchange rights in connection with the sale of certain products for which reliable estimates of return or exchange had not been made, as a result of which the revenue associated with those sales should not have been recognized upon shipment to the customers under GAAP. As a result, we recorded $2.6 million in net revenue reversal with a $2.1 million gross profit and corresponding net loss impact spread over each of the quarters of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005. 52 The following presents selected unaudited quarterly financial data for each of the quarters in the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. 2005 First Quarter(2) Second Quarter(3) Third Quarter(4) Fourth Quarter(5) restated (in thousands, except per share data) Net revenue $ 91,920 $ 102,271 $ 106,294 $ 121,365 Gross profit $ 32,189 $ 34,713 $ 39,635 $ 45,775 Net (loss) income $ (7,802 ) $ 2,503 $ (6,572 ) $ (7,338 ) Net (loss) income available to common stockholdersbasic and diluted(1) $ (7,802 ) $ 2,503 $ (6,572 ) $ (7,338 ) Net (loss) income per common sharebasic(1) $ (0.37 ) $ 0.11 $ (0.25 ) $ (0.27 ) Net (loss) income per common sharediluted(1) $ (0.37 ) $ 0.11 $ (0.25 ) $ (0.27 ) 2004 First Quarter(6) Second Quarter(7) Third Quarter(8) Fourth Quarter(9) restated restated restated restated Net revenue $ 91,108 $ 89,143 $ 96,677 $ 97,063 Gross profit $ 37,197 $ 35,328 $ 37,716 $ 36,763 Net loss $ (3,383 ) $ (6,733 ) $ (2,880 ) $ (3,600 ) Net loss available to common stockholdersbasic and diluted(1) $ (4,132 ) $ (6,733 ) $ (2,880 ) $ (3,600 ) Net loss per common sharebasic and diluted(1) $ (0.22 ) $ (0.34 ) $ (0.14 ) $ (0.18 ) (1)Net (loss) income available to common stockholders and basic and diluted net (loss) income per common share are computed as consistent with the annual per share calculations described in Notes 2(k) and 12 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (2)Included in net loss in the first quarter of 2005 is a charge of $1.6 million associated with a recall of certain drugs of abuse products and an $8.4 million gain from a legal settlement in our nutritionals business. (3)Included in net income in the second quarter of 2005 is a charge of $2.4 million associated with a reserve for excess quantities of certain raw materials and finished goods, a charge of $3.5 million associated with our decision to cease operations at our facility in Galway, Ireland, a charge of $4.2 million related to a legal settlement with PBM, and a $15.0 million gain related to an intellectual property settlement with Quidel relating to periods prior to 2005. (4)Included in net loss in the third quarter of 2005 is a charge of $0.7 million associated with our decision to cease operations at our facility in Galway, Ireland. (5)Included in net loss in the fourth quarter of 2005 is a charge of $0.9 million principally associated with our decision to cease operations at our facility in Galway, Ireland. (6)Included in net loss in the first quarter of 2004 is a charge of $3.5 million in interest expense representing the write-off of deferred financing costs and prepayment fees and penalties related to the repayment of borrowings under our primary senior credit facility and certain subordinated notes with the proceeds from our $150.0 million bond offering in February 2004. (7)Included in net loss in the second quarter of 2004 is an additional charge of $0.3 million in interest expense representing the write-off of financing costs related to the repayment of borrowings under our primary senior credit facility with the proceeds from our $150.0 million bond offering in 53 February 2004 and the establishment of a specific reserve for potential bad debt and unsaleable inventory totaling $1.5 million associated with a customer that failed to perform under the terms of our agreement and is currently subject to legal action. (8)Included in net loss in the third quarter of 2004 is a $1.7 million restructuring charge covering all expected severance, early retirement and outplacement services arising from a completed plan of termination at our manufacturing facility in Bedford, England. (9)Included in net loss in the fourth quarter of 2004 are: (i) $0.9 million in release of a pre-acquisition legal contingency reserve upon reaching and signing a settlement agreement, and (ii) $0.5 million in litigation settlement gain. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Management's conclusions regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at that time. We and our management understand nonetheless that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. In reaching their conclusions stated above regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, our CEO and CFO concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date at the "reasonable assurance" level. Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the CEO and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of our company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal 54 controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on management's assessment and those criteria, management determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In conducting management's evaluation of the effectiveness of our Company's internal control over financial reporting, management excluded the acquisitions of Binax, BioStar and IDT, which were completed in 2005. The contribution from these acquisitions represented approximately 3.8%, 1.6% and 0.9% of net revenues and 3.2%, 2.9% and 3.0% of total assets, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005. Refer to Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these acquisitions and other acquisitions and their impact on our consolidated financial statements. As indicated in its Attestation Report included below, BDO Seidman, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this report, has attested to our management's assessments regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. and Subsidiaries: We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9a, that Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operation effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 55 recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of annual internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Binax, BioStar and IDT, which are included in the 2005 consolidated financial statements of Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries and constituted approximately 3.8%, 1.6%, and 0.9% of consolidated net revenues and 3.2%, 2.9%, and 3.0% of consolidated total assets, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005. Management did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting at these entities because Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries acquired these entities during 2005. Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these acquisitions and their impact on Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the entities referred to above. In our opinion, management's assessment that Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, is based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Accounting Oversight Board (United States) the consolidated financial statements of Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries and our report therein dated March 14, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion. /s/ BDO Seidman, LLP Boston, MA March 14, 2006 Changes in internal control over financial reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As discussed in Note 2(p) of the consolidated financial statements, the Company has previously restated its financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 to account properly for previously unidentified return or exchange rights in connection with the sale of certain products for which reliable estimates of return or exchange had not been made, as a result of which the revenue associated with those sales should not have been recognized upon shipment. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Our report dated March 14, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on management's assessment on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. /s/ BDO Seidman, LLP Boston, Massachusetts March 14, 2006 F-2 INVERNESS MEDICAL INNOVATIONS, INC.

F-11 INVERNESS MEDICAL INNOVATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) Description of Business and Basis of Presentation Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries develop, manufacture and market in vitro diagnostic products for the over-the-counter pregnancy and fertility/ovulation test market and the professional rapid diagnostic test market worldwide. In addition, we manufacture a variety of vitamins and nutritional supplements that we market under our brands and those of private label retailers in the consumer market primarily in the United States. Our business is organized into three primary operating segments: (i) consumer diagnostic products, (ii) vitamins and nutritional supplements, and (iii) professional diagnostic products. The consumer diagnostic products segment includes our over-the-counter pregnancy and fertility/ovulation tests. The vitamins and nutritional supplements segment includes branded and private label vitamins and nutritional supplements that are sold over-the-counter. The professional diagnostic products segment includes an array of innovative rapid diagnostic test products and other in vitro diagnostic tests marketed to medical professionals and laboratories for detection of infectious diseases, drugs of abuse and pregnancy. Our company was incorporated on May 11, 2001 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Inverness Medical Technology, Inc. ("IMT"). On November 21, 2001, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Split-Off and Merger dated May 23, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), Johnson & Johnson acquired IMT in a merger transaction and, simultaneously, our company, a then subsidiary of IMT, was split-off from IMT as a separate publicly traded company. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and related agreements, immediately prior to the consummation of the transaction, IMT restructured its operations so that all of its non-diabetes businesses (women's health, nutritional supplements and professional diagnostics) were held by our company and our subsidiaries. At the closing of the transaction, all of the shares of our common stock held by IMT were split-off from IMT. Since the consummation of the split-off and merger described above, we have completed a number of acquisitions. During 2005, we acquired Thermo BioStar, Inc. ("BioStar") on September 30, 2005, Innogenetics Diagnostica Y Terapeutica, S.A.U. ("IDT") on September 30, 2005, the Determine/DainaScreen assets of Abbott Laboratories' rapid diagnostic business (the "Determine business") on June 30, 2005, Binax, Inc. ("Binax") on March 31, 2005, Ischemia Technologies, Inc. ("Ischemia") on March 16, 2005 and the consumer pregnancy test business of Advanced Clinical Systems Pty Ltd ("ACS") on January 24, 2005 (Note 4 (a)). BioStar develops and manufactures high-performance, rapid diagnostic tests, including tests for the detection of infectious diseases. IDT is a Spanish distributor of diagnostic products. The Determine business produces diagnostic tests that are designed to provide rapid qualitative results for detecting several diseases, including hepatitis, HIV 1/2 and syphilis. Binax is a developer, manufacturer and distributor of rapid diagnostic products for infectious disease testing, primarily related to the respiratory system. Ischemia was a privately held, venture-backed company that developed, manufactured and marketed the only FDA-cleared in vitro diagnostic test targeted on cardiac ischemia. In acquiring ACS, we obtained the rights to the Crystal Clear brand, the leading consumer pregnancy test in Australia, and a leading position in New Zealand. During 2004, we acquired Advantage Diagnostics Corporation ("ADC") on June 16, 2004 and Viva Diagnostika ("Viva") on June 2, 2004 (Note 4(b)). ADC was a closely held lateral flow diagnostic company that specializes in rapid test development and component manufacturing. Viva was a closely held distributor of professional diagnostic products to the German marketplace. During 2003, we acquired the rapid diagnostics business from Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott") on September 30, 2003 (the "Abbott business"), Applied Biotech, Inc. and subsidiary ("ABI") from F-12 Apogent Technologies, Inc. on August 27, 2003 and Ostex International, Inc. ("Ostex") on June 30, 2003 (Note 4 (c)). The business acquired from Abbott in 2003 relates to consumer diagnostic pregnancy tests and various professional rapid diagnostic product lines, as well as certain transferred and licensed intellectual property related to these products. ABI is a developer, manufacturer and distributor of consumer diagnostic and professional diagnostic products in the areas of women's health, infectious disease and drugs of abuse testing. Ostex develops and commercializes osteoporosis diagnostics products and holds intellectual property rights in the field of osteoporosis diagnostics. In addition, we acquired a small research and development facility, Scandinavian Micro Biodevices ApS ("SMB"), on November 18, 2003. Acquisitions that occurred during 2002 and 2001 include our acquisition of the Wampole Division of MedPointe Inc. ("Wampole") on September 20, 2002, IVC Industries, Inc. (d/b/a Inverness Medical Nutritionals Group or "IMN") on March 19, 2002 and certain entities, businesses and intellectual property of Unilver Plc (the "Unipath business") on December 20, 2001. Wampole markets and distributes point-of-care and professional medical diagnostic products. IMN manufactures and distributes vitamins and nutritional supplements. The Unipath business develops, manufactures and distributes women's health and professional diagnostics products. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the entities contributed to us by IMT and the subsequently acquired entities and businesses since their respective acquisition dates, along with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the businesses. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our equity accounts for all periods presented reflect the par value of our stock at the date of incorporation, adjusted for the fixed exchange ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement and related agreements and the related stock split; the historical equity accounts of the legal entities that comprise our company are consolidated as if such subsidiaries and businesses were historically organized in a manner consistent with the restructuring set forth in the Merger Agreement and related agreements. (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Use of Estimates To prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, our management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from such estimates. (b) Foreign Currencies We follow the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. In general, the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are the local currencies. For purpose of consolidating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries, all assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date while the stockholders' equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates. Translation gains and losses that result from the conversion of the balance sheets of the foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars are recorded to cumulative translation adjustment which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity (Note 13). F-13 The income and expense accounts of our foreign subsidiaries are translated using the average rates of exchange during each reporting period. Net realized and unrealized foreign currency exchange transaction losses of $0.3 million and $0.7 million during 2005 and 2004, respectively, and gain of $5,000 during 2003, are included as a component of other income, net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. (c) Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consisted of money market funds at December 31, 2005 and 2004. (d) Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market and made up of raw material, work-in-process and finished goods. The costs elements of work-in-process and finished goods inventory consist of raw material, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. Where finished goods inventory is purchased from third-party manufacturers, the costs of such finished goods inventory represent the costs to acquire such inventory. (e) Property, Plant and Equipment We record property, plant and equipment at historical cost or, in the case of a business combination, at fair value on the date of the business combination. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives of the related assets: machinery, laboratory equipment and tooling3-10 years, buildings20-39 years, leasehold improvementslesser of remaining term of lease or estimated useful life of asset, computer software and equipment3-5 years and furniture and fixtures3-10 years. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation and amortization expense related to property, plant and equipment amounted to $14.9 million, $13.1 million and $10.1 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. (f) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We review the valuation of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually, in lieu of being amortized, using a fair value approach at the reporting unit level. Furthermore, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not an impairment loss has been incurred. An impairment loss shall be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Impairment losses shall be recognized in operations. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. If these assumptions differ materially from future results, we may record impairment charges in the future. Our annual impairment review performed on September 30, 2005 did not indicate that goodwill related to our consumer diagnostic products or to our professional diagnostic products reporting units was impaired. F-14 (g) Impairment of Other Long-Lived Tangible and Intangible Assets We examine, in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, on a periodic basis the carrying value of our long-lived tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there are any impairment losses. If indicators of impairment were present with respect to long-lived tangible and intangible assets used in operations and undiscounted future cash flows were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets' carrying amount, an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period the impairment is identified based on the fair value of the asset. We believe that the carrying values of our other long-lived tangible and intangible assets were realizable as of December 31, 2005. (h) Income Taxes We follow the provisions of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The provisions of SFAS No. 109 also require the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carry-forwards, to the extent that the realization of such benefits is more likely than not. To the extent that it is not likely that we will realize such benefits, we must establish a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets (Note 15). (i) Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenues is derived from product sales. We recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services rendered, (3) the fee is fixed and determinable and (4) collection is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue upon title transfer of the products to third-party customers, less a reserve for estimated product returns and allowances. Certain sale arrangements require us to accept product returns. When a right of return exists, we record revenue when the right of return is no longer applicable. In connection with the acquisitions of the rapid diagnostic business in September 2003 (Note 4 (c)) and the Determine business in June 2005 (Note 4(a)) from Abbott, we entered into a transition services agreement with Abbott, whereby Abbott would continue to distribute certain of the acquired products sold for a period of up to 18 months following each acquisition. During the transition period, we recognized revenue on sales of the products when title transferred from Abbott to third-party customers. To a lesser extent, we also receive license and royalty revenue from agreements with third-party licensees. Revenue from fixed fee license and royalty agreements are recognized on a straight-line basis over the obligation period of the related license agreements. License and royalty fees that are calculated based on the licensees' sales are generally recognized upon receipt of the license or royalty payments, unless we are able to reasonably estimate the fees as they are earned. License and royalty fees that are determinable prior to the receipt thereof are recognized in the period they are earned. (j) Employee Stock-Based Compensation Arrangements We adopted an employee stock option plan in 2001 (Note 13(c)). For all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we accounted for our employee stock-based F-15 compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. We have elected to use the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure. Had compensation expense for stock option grants to employees been determined based on the fair value method at the grant date for awards under the stock option plans consistent with the method prescribed by SFAS No. 123, our net (loss) income would have been (increased) decreased to the pro forma amounts indicated as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (restated) (restated) (in thousands, except per share amounts) Net (loss) incomeas reported $ (19,209 ) $ (16,596 ) $ 8,653 Stock-based employee compensationas reported(a) 139  397 Pro forma stock-based employee compensation (6,366 ) (5,675 ) (6,161 ) Net (loss) incomepro forma $ (25,436 ) $ (22,271 ) $ 2,889 Net (loss) income per common sharebasic Net (loss) incomeas reported $ (0.79 ) $ (0.87 ) $ 0.49 Stock-based employee compensationas reported 0.01  0.02 Pro forma stock-based employee compensation (0.26 ) (0.28 ) (0.39 ) Net (loss) income per sharepro forma $ (1.04 ) $ (1.15 ) $ 0.12 Net (loss) income per common sharediluted Net (loss) incomeas reported $ (0.79 ) $ (0.87 ) $ 0.44 Stock-based employee compensationas reported 0.01  0.02 Pro forma stock-based employee compensation (0.26 ) (0.28 ) (0.35 ) Net (loss) income per sharepro forma $ (1.04 ) $ (1.15 ) $ 0.11 (a)Stock-based employee compensation expense, as reported, represents the amortization of deferred compensation of certain stock options and restricted stock that were granted to employees below fair market value and options granted in lieu of cash compensation. We have computed the pro forma disclosures for stock options granted to employees after January 1, 1995 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model prescribed by SFAS No. 123. The assumptions used during each of the three years ended December 31, 2005 were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Risk-free interest rate 3.58-4.46% 2.80-3.95% 2.33-3.49% Expected dividend yield    Expected lives 5 years 5 years 5 years Expected volatility 45% 47% 55% F-16 The weighted average fair value under the Black-Scholes option pricing model of options granted to employees during 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $11.85, $9.86 and $9.34, respectively. All options granted during these periods were granted at fair market value on date of grants. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS No. 123R") at the beginning of the fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005. Consequently, we adopted SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006. See Note 2(o) for further discussion. (k) Net (Loss) Income per Common Share Net (loss) income per common share, computed in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, is based upon the weighted average number of outstanding common shares and the dilutive effect of common share equivalents, such as options and warrants to purchase common stock, convertible preferred stock and convertible notes, if applicable, that are outstanding each year (Note 12). (l) Other Operating Expenses We expense advertising costs as incurred. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, advertising costs amounted to $21.7 million, $19.9 million and $18.6 million, respectively, and are included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, to the extent that we charge our customers for shipping and handling costs, these costs are recorded as product revenues. (m) Concentration of Credit Risk, Off-Balance Sheet Risks and Other Risks and Uncertainties Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We invest our excess cash primarily in high quality securities and limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one financial institution. We do not require collateral or other securities to support customer receivables; however, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses. There were no individual customer accounts receivable balances outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004 that were in excess of 10% of the gross accounts receivable balance on those dates. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we had one customer that represented 10%, 11% and 11%, respectively, of our net revenues, who purchases both our consumer diagnostic products and vitamins and nutritional supplements. We rely on a number of third parties to manufacture certain of our products. If any of our third party manufacturers cannot, or will not, manufacture our products in the required volumes, on a cost-effective basis, in a timely manner, or at all, we will have to secure additional manufacturing capacity. Any interruption or delay in manufacturing could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. F-17 (n) Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments Our primary financial instruments at December 31, 2005 and 2004 consisted of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt. The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying values at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The estimated fair values have been determined through information obtained from market sources. Additionally, our subsidiary in England enters into short-term foreign currency exchange forward contracts from time to time to minimize its exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations because a substantial portion of its business is transacted in currencies other than its functional currency. We account for our derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and related amendments, including SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts totaling $3.0 million. Changes of $217,000 in the market value of these contracts during 2005 were recorded to other income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. (o) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections," which replaces ABP Opinion No. 20, "Accounting Changes," and FASB Statement No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements," and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date SFAS No. 154 was issued. We do not believe that adoption of SFAS No. 154 will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations," which is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." The interpretation requires a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation be recognized if the fair value of the liability can be reasonable estimated. The interpretation is effective for years ending after December 15, 2005. The interpretation is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchange of Nonmonetary Assetsan amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions." SFAS No. 153 is based on the principle that exchange of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair market value of the assets exchanged. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the exception of nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS No. 153 and do not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which addresses the accounting for transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the company or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company's equity instruments or F-18 that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. It eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using APB Opinion No. 25, and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. As permitted by the current SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-BasedCompensation, we have been accounting for share-based compensation to employees using APB Opinion No. 25's intrinsic value method and, as such, we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options. Under the original guidance of SFAS No. 123R, we were to adopt the statement's provisions for the interim period beginning after June 15, 2005. However, in April 2005, as a result of an action by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies were allowed to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R at the beginning of their fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005. Consequently, we adopted SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006. If we had adopted this standard in 2005, our net loss for 2005 would have been $6.2 million (or $0.25 per diluted share) higher than reported in 2005. While we expect that the requirement to expense stock options and other equity interests that have been or will be granted pursuant to our equity incentive program will significantly increase our operating expenses and result in lower earnings per share, the amount of the increase in operating expenses will depend on the level of future grants, the terms and fair values of such grants, and expected volatilities, among other factors, present at the grant dates. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have no impact on our cash flows. In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costsan amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material should be recognized as current period charges in all circumstances. Additionally, SFAS No. 151 requires that a facility's fixed production overhead be charged to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facility. As required, we adopted SFAS No. 151 on January 1, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 151 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. (p) Restatements of 2004 and 2003 Financial Statements We previously restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 and for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 to correct errors under GAAP relating to the recognition of revenue. During 2005, we determined that certain customers of one of our diagnostics divisions were provided return or exchange rights in connection with the sale of products, as a result of which the revenue associated with those sales should not have been recognized upon shipment to the customers under GAAP. As a result, we recorded $4.5 million in net revenue reversal with a $3.4 million gross margin and corresponding net loss impact spread over the quarters of 2004 and 2003 and an increase in both revenues and gross profit of $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2005. The restatements as a result of the errors relating to the recognition of revenue are reflected in the amounts below as "as restated on August 26, 2005." The following lists the accounts in the consolidated financial statements that were affected by the aforementioned restatements, with comparisons of the restated amounts to the reported amounts included in our 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 16, 2005 ("as reported") and the effect of such restatements on net (loss) income and net (loss) income per share. F-19 All applicable amounts relating to the aforementioned restatements have been reflected in these consolidated financial statements and notes hereto. 2004 As restated on August 26, 2005 As reported (in thousands, except per share amounts) Net product sales $ 365,432 $ 368,351 Cost of sales 226,987 227,548 Net loss (16,596 ) (14,238 ) Net loss per common sharebasic and diluted $ (0.87 ) $ (0.75 ) December 31, 2004 As restated on August 26, 2005 As reported (in thousands) Inventories $ 61,234 $ 60,145 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 56,242 $ 51,886 Accumulated deficit $ (91,018 ) $ (87,752 ) 2003 As restated on August 26, 2005 As reported (in thousands, except per share amounts) Net product sales $ 285,430 $ 286,984 Cost of sales $ 167,641 $ 168,171 Provision for income taxes $ 2,911 $ 3,028 Net income $ 8,653 $ 9,560 Net income per common sharebasic $ 0.49 $ 0.55 Net income per common sharediluted $ 0.44 $ 0.49 December 31, 2003 As restated on August 26, 2005 As reported (in thousands) Inventories $ 47,953 $ 47,423 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 42,559 $ 41,122 Accumulated deficit $ (73,672 ) $ (72,765 ) F-20 (3) Other Balance Sheet Information Components of selected captions in the consolidated balance sheets consist of: December 31, 2005 2004 (restated) (in thousands) Inventories: Raw materials $ 25,488 $ 23,434 Work-in-process 17,812 14,956 Finished goods 27,909 22,844 $ 71,209 $ 61,234 Property, plant and equipment, net: Machinery, laboratory equipment and tooling $ 78,559 $ 67,650 Land and buildings 8,942 9,053 Leasehold improvements 18,980 12,037 Computer software and equipment 8,811 7,358 Furniture and fixtures 3,982 2,992 119,274 99,090 Less: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (47,063 ) (32,310 ) $ 72,211 $ 66,780 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities: Compensation and compensation-related $ 8,959 $ 11,121 Advertising and marketing 6,608 9,036 Professional fees 5,649 5,615 Interest payable 6,002 5,631 Royalty obligations 4,001 5,342 Deferred revenue 5,981 4,473 Other 27,546 15,024 $ 64,746 $ 56,242 (4) Business Combinations All of the acquisitions discussed below, with the exception of the acquisition of the consumer pregnancy test business of ACS (Note 4(a)) and of Biomar Diagnostic Systems GmbH ("Biomar") (Note 4(b)), resulted in the recognition of goodwill. Acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy. When we acquire businesses, we seek to complement existing products and services, enhance or expand our product lines and/or expand our customer base. We determine what we are willing to pay for each acquisition partially based on our expectation that we can cost effectively integrate the products and services of the acquired companies into our existing infrastructure. In addition, we utilize existing infrastructure of the acquired companies to cost effectively introduce our products to new geographic areas. All these factors contributed to the acquisition prices of the acquired businesses discussed below, that were in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired and the resultant goodwill. F-21 (a) Acquisitions in 2005 (i)Acquisition of BioStar On September 30, 2005, we acquired BioStar, a leading developer and manufacturer of high-performance, rapid diagnostic tests, including tests for the detection of infectious diseases. The aggregate purchase price was $53.7 million, which consisted of $53.1 million in cash, $0.5 million in estimated direct acquisition costs and $0.1 million in estimated exit costs, which we recorded in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination. The following is a summary of the allocation of the aggregate purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition: (in thousands) Accounts receivable $ 5,247 Inventories 2,046 Property, plant and equipment 1,510 Goodwill 30,843 Core technology 4,550 Customer relationships 6,760 OIA trade name 2,730 Trademarks 4,200 Other assets 795 Accounts payable and accrued expenses (4,991 ) Total consideration $ 53,690 The acquisition of BioStar is accounted for as a purchase under SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. Accordingly, the operating results of BioStar have been included in our consolidated financial statements of operations after the acquisition date as part of our professional diagnostic products reporting unit. We have assigned indefinite lives to the acquired goodwill and certain trademarks. The value of such goodwill is fully deductible for tax purposes over 15 years. The values allocated to the acquired core technology, customer relationships and OIA trade names are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 10, 5 and 10 years, respectively. The weighted average amortization period for the acquired intangible assets with finite lives is 6.8 years. The trademarks, core technology, customer relationships and OIA trade name are allocated respectively to other intangible assets with indefinite lives, core technology and patents, net and other intangible assets, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005. (ii)Acquisition of IDT On September 30, 2005, we acquired IDT, a Spanish distributor of diagnostic products. The aggregate purchase price was $20.3 million, which consisted of $11.7 million in cash, an $8.4 million working capital adjustment, which was paid during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, and $0.2 million in estimated direct acquisition costs. F-22 The following is a summary of the allocation of the aggregate purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition: (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 76 Accounts receivable 10,913 Inventories 520 Property, plant and equipment 771 Goodwill 9,062 Customer relationships 3,000 Other assets 188 Accounts payable and accrued expenses (3,164 ) Deferred tax liability (1,050 ) Total consideration $ 20,316 The above values for the assets acquired and subsequent amortization and liabilities assumed are based on preliminary management estimates. Final purchase price allocation may differ from the above. Management is also in the process of determining the useful lives of the customer relationships as listed above. The estimated value allocated to the acquired customer relationships is being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 5 years. The customer relationships are included in other intangible assets, net, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The acquisition of IDT is accounted for as a purchase under SFAS No. 141. Accordingly, the operating results of IDT have been included in our consolidated financial statements of operations after the acquisition date as part of our professional diagnostic products reporting unit. Goodwill resulting from this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes. (iii)Acquisition of Determine business On June 30, 2005, we acquired the Determine business which produces diagnostic tests that are designed to provide rapid qualitative results for detecting several diseases, including hepatitis, HIV 1/2 and syphilis. The aggregate purchase price was $58.1 million, which consisted of $56.5 million in cash and $1.6 million in estimated direct acquisition costs. The following is a summary of the allocation of the aggregate purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition: (in thousands) Inventories $ 3,412 Property, plant and equipment 1,500 Goodwill 40,913 Trademark 5,000 Customer relationships 7,500 Manufacturing know-how 3,500 Accrued expenses (3,723 ) Total consideration $ 58,102 F-23 The above values for the assets acquired are based on preliminary management estimates due to the timing of the acquisition. Final purchase price allocation may differ from the above. Management is also in the process of determining the useful lives of the acquired intangibles as listed above. We have assigned indefinite lives to the acquired goodwill and trademark. Goodwill resulting from this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes over lives varying from 10 to 25 years, depending on the tax jurisdiction. We estimate the useful lives of the manufacturing know-how to be ten years and the customer relationships asset to be six years and included them in other intangible assets, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The weighted average amortization period for the acquired intangible assets with finite lives is 6.9 years. The acquisition of the Determine business is accounted for as a purchase under SFAS No. 141. Accordingly, the operating results of the Determine business have been included in our consolidated statements of operations after the acquisition date as part of our professional diagnostic products reporting unit. (iv)Acquisition of Binax On March 31, 2005, we acquired Binax, a privately held developer, manufacturer and distributor of rapid diagnostic products for infectious disease testing, primarily related to the respiratory system. The aggregate purchase price was $44.7 million, which consisted of $9.0 million in cash, 1.4 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate fair value of $35.2 million and $0.5 million in estimated direct acquisition costs. The fair value of our common stock was determined based on the average market price of our common stock over the periods just prior to and following the date of the acquisition agreement, pursuant to EITF No. 99-12, Determination of the Measurement Date for the Market Price of Acquirer Securities Issued in a Purchase Business Combination. The terms of the acquisition agreement also provide for $11.0 million of contingent cash consideration payable to the Binax shareholders upon the successful completion of certain new product developments during the five years following the acquisition. This contingent consideration will be accounted for as an increase in the aggregate purchase price if and when the contingency occurs. F-24 The following is a summary of the allocation of the aggregate purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition: (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,556 Accounts receivable 5,264 Inventories 3,086 Property, plant and equipment 2,421 Goodwill 15,466 Product technology 3,900 Customer relationships 11,700 Trademark 4,500 Non-compete agreement 30 Other assets 688 Deferred tax asset 6,312 Accounts payable and accrued expenses (2,076 ) Deferred tax liability (8,106 ) $ 44,741 We have assigned indefinite lives to the acquired goodwill and trademarks. Goodwill generated from this acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. We estimate the useful lives of the product technology, customer relationships and the non-compete agreement to be 7, 13 and 7 years and have included them in core technology and patents, net, and other intangible assets, net, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The weighted average amortization period for the acquired intangible assets with finite lives is 10.7 years. The acquisition of Binax is accounted for as a purchase under SFAS No. 141. Accordingly, the operating results of Binax have been included in our consolidated statement of operations since the acquisition date as part of our professional diagnostic products reporting unit. (v)Acquisition of Ischemia On March 16, 2005, we acquired Ischemia, a privately held, venture-backed company that has developed, manufactures and markets the only FDA-cleared in vitro diagnostic test targeted on cardiac ischemia. The aggregate purchase price was $27.2 million, which consisted of 968,000 shares of our common stock with an aggregate fair value of $22.8 million, estimated exit costs of $1.5 million to vacate Ischemia's manufacturing and administrative facilities, which we recorded in accordance with EITF No. 95-3, estimated direct acquisition costs of $2.4 million and $0.5 million in assumed debt. The fair value of our common stock was determined in accordance with EITF No. 99-12. F-25 The following is a summary of the allocation of the aggregate purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition: (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 115 Accounts receivable 58 Inventories 40 Property, plant and equipment 288 Goodwill 7,532 Patents 19,200 Customer relationships 200 Other assets 99 Deferred tax asset 7,760 Accounts payable and accrued expenses (377 ) Deferred tax liability (7,760 ) $ 27,155 We have assigned indefinite lives to the acquired goodwill. Goodwill generated from this acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. We estimated the useful lives of the patents to be from 9 to 15 years and customer related intangible asset to be 11 years and included them in core technology and patents, net, and other intangible assets, net, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The acquisition of Ischemia is accounted for as a purchase under SFAS No. 141. Accordingly, the operating results of Ischemia have been included in our consolidated statements of operations after the acquisition date as part of our professional diagnostic products reporting unit. (vi)Acquisition of ACS On January 24, 2005, we acquired the consumer pregnancy test business of ACS. In acquiring ACS, we obtained the rights to the Crystal Clear brand. Crystal Clear is the leading consumer pregnancy test in Australia and has a leading position in New Zealand. The purchase price of ACS consisted of $4.6 million in cash and estimated direct acquisition costs of $0.3 million. The majority of the purchase price of ACS is allocated to the intangible asset, trademarks, with an average useful life of 7 years. The acquisition of ACS is accounted for as a purchase under SFAS No. 141. Accordingly, the operating results for this business have been included in our consolidated statements of operations after the acquisition date as part of our consumer diagnostic product reporting unit. (b) Acquisitions in 2004 (i)Acquisition of Biomar On December 10, 2004, our subsidiary, Inverness Medical Switzerland GmbH ("IMS"), settled a patent infringement lawsuit in Germany against Biomar and its principal stockholder. We had alleged that Biomar's rapid diagnostic tests infringed on several of our patents. In advance of a court decision, we and Biomar agreed to settle the litigation under the terms of an agreement through which Biomar F-26 agreed to transfer its rapid diagnostic business to us, including the use of the Biomar trade name, in exchange for a release of all past infringement claims. We accounted for this settlement in accordance with EITF No. 04-01, Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination, and recorded the fair values of the assets acquired, aggregating $0.5 million, as a gain in other income, net, in the accompanying statement of operations of 2004. The acquisition of Biomar is accounted for as a purchase under SFAS No. 141. Accordingly, the operating results of Biomar have been included in our consolidated statements of operations after the acquisition date as part of our professional diagnostic products reporting unit. (ii)Acquisition of ADC On June 16, 2004, we acquired ADC, a closely held lateral flow diagnostic company that specializes in rapid test development and component manufacturing. The purchase price of ADC consisted of $2.4 million in cash and $0.2 million in assumed debt. The terms of the merger agreement, as amended, also provide for $1.5 million of contingent consideration payable to the ADC shareholders upon the successful completion of a new product under development by June 30, 2006. The payment of the contingent consideration, if any, will be recorded as an addition to the purchase price. The acquisition of ADC is accounted for as a purchase under SFAS No. 141. Accordingly, the operating results of ADC have been included in our consolidated statements of operations after the acquisition date as part of our professional diagnostic products reporting unit. (iii)Acquisition of Viva On June 2, 2004, we acquired Viva, a closely held distributor of professional diagnostic products to the German marketplace. The purchase price of Viva consisted of $2.6 million in cash, 0.2 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate fair value of $3.0 million and $0.3 million in assumed debt. We believe that Viva, with its established German distribution network, will provide us with expanded distribution channel for our professional diagnostic products, as well as for our cardiac products in development. The acquisition of Viva is accounted for as a purchase under SFAS No. 141. Accordingly, the operating results of Viva have been included in our consolidated statements of operations after the acquisition date as part of our professional diagnostic products reporting unit. (c) Acquisitions in 2003 (i)Acquisition of SMB On November 18, 2003, we acquired SMB, a developer and manufacturer of customized and standard devices for analysis of bio-molecules. The purchase price of SMB consisted of $3.0 million in cash, 0.1 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate fair value of $2.5 million and $0.1 million in assumed debt. Simultaneously with the acquisition, we acquired a technology license from SMB's former parent for $0.2 million. The acquisition of SMB provided us with access to SMB's intellectual property and research and development capabilities. The fair value of our common stock was determined in accordance with EITF No. 99-12. F-27 The acquisition of the SMB is accounted for as a purchase under SFAS No. 141. Accordingly, the operating activities of SMB, which consist principally of research and development activities, have been included in our consolidated statements of operations after the acquisition date. (ii)Acquisition of 2003 Abbott Business On September 30, 2003, we acquired from Abbott certain assets related to Abbott's lines of consumer diagnostic pregnancy tests and professional rapid diagnostics for various testing needs, including strep throat, pregnancy and drugs of abuse. The acquired assets also include certain transferred and licensed intellectual property related to these products. This acquisition complements our consumer and professional diagnostic product portfolios, as well as helps to establish a larger global presence in which to facilitate the introduction of new products. The aggregate purchase price was $95.1 million, which consisted of $55.0 million in cash, $37.5 million in the form of 1.6 million shares of our common stock and direct acquisition costs of $2.6 million. The fair value of our common stock was determined in accordance with EITF No. 99-12. We financed the cash portion of the purchase price by obtaining loans under our amended senior credit facility (Note 6(a)). The aggregate purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired as follows: (in thousands) Inventories $ 380 Property, plant and equipment 1,310 Goodwill 69,487 Trade nameSignify 6,400 Trade nameFact plus 1,600 Trade nameTestPack 8,600 Patents 1,570 Customer related intangible assets 5,735 $ 95,082 The acquisition of the Abbott business is accounted for as a purchase under SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. Accordingly, the operating results of the Abbott business have been included in our consolidated statements of operations after the acquisition date as part of each of our consumer diagnostic products and professional diagnostic products reporting units. The acquired goodwill, all of which is deductible for tax purposes with varying lives of 15 to 25 years, depending on the tax jurisdiction, is allocated by business segment based on estimated future revenue of the acquired assets as follows: $18.8 million to consumer diagnostic products and $50.7 million to professional diagnostic products. We believe the Signify and TestPack trade names represent indefinitelived intangible assets and estimate the useful life for the Fact plus trade name to be 5 years. The Signify and TestPack trade names and Fact plus trade name are included on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in trademark and trade names with indefinite lives and other intangible assets, net, respectively. Patents, which values are included in core technology and patents, net, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are assigned useful lives ranging from 1 to 18 years. Customer related intangible assets, which values are included in other intangible assets, net, on the accompanying consolidated balance F-28 sheets are assigned useful lives ranging from 1.5 to 5 years. The weighted average amortization period for the acquired intangible assets with finite lives is approximately 5 years. This acquisition resulted in a significant amount of goodwill. Goodwill represents the premium paid in excess of the value we allocated to identifiable assets. Goodwill arose as a result of acquired going concern value, access to employees via the acquisition agreements and synergies. Because of the unique way in which the acquisition of the Abbott business was structured, access to the factors required for maintaining the continuity of the business was achieved through contractual arrangements with terms of up to two years to facilitate the rapid integration of the Abbott business into our infrastructure with minimal restructuring or exit costs required. For this reason, the vast majority of the goodwill associated with the acquisition was attributable to synergies arising from the application of our existing infrastructure to the acknowledged brands of the acquired business. The acquisition was also attractive because of the similarity in mode of operation between the Abbott products and our existing products. (iii)Acquisition of ABI On August 27, 2003, we acquired ABI from Apogent Technologies, Inc. ("Apogent"). ABI is a developer, manufacturer and distributor of rapid diagnostic products in the areas of women's health, infectious disease and drugs of abuse testing. In the transaction, we also acquired ABI's wholly-owned subsidiary, Forefront Diagnostics, Inc. ("Forefront"). Forefront develops, manufactures and distributes rapid diagnostic products for drugs of abuse testing. These products broaden our professional diagnostic product portfolio. ABI also provides us with additional manufacturing capabilities and new distribution channels for our professional diagnostic products. The aggregate purchase price of ABI was $28.8 million, which consisted of $13.4 million in cash, 0.7 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate fair value of $14.3 million and direct acquisition costs of $1.2 million. The fair value of our common stock was determined in accordance with EITF No. 99-12. We financed the cash portion of the purchase price by obtaining a loan under our amended senior credit facility (Note 6(a)). The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition: (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1 Accounts receivable 6,368 Inventories 6,056 Property, plant and equipment 4,301 Goodwill 11,258 Customer related intangible asset 2,000 Manufacturing know-how 3,500 Other assets 117 Accounts payable and accrued expenses (4,761 ) $ 28,840 F-29 The acquisition of ABI is accounted for as a purchase under SFAS No. 141. Accordingly, the operating results of ABI have been included in our consolidated statement of operations after the acquisition date as part of each of our consumer diagnostic products and professional diagnostic products reporting units. We have allocated goodwill of $2.2 million and $9.1 million to the consumer diagnostic products and professional diagnostic products business segments, respectively, based on estimated future revenue of the acquired businesses. Goodwill generated from this acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. We estimate the useful lives of both intangible assets to be 15 years and have included them in other intangible assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The weighted average amortization period for the acquired intangible assets with finite lives is 15 years. (iv)Acquisition of Ostex On June 30, 2003, we acquired Ostex through a merger transaction. Ostex develops and commercializes osteoporosis diagnostic products. This acquisition also provides us with intellectual property rights in the field of osteoporosis diagnostics. The aggregate purchase price of Ostex was $33.7 million, which consisted of 1.6 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate fair value of $23.5 million, the assumption of fully-vested stock options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 0.3 million shares of our common stock, which options and warrants have an aggregate fair value of $1.8 million, estimated exit costs of $3.9 million, which primarily consists of severance and costs to vacate Ostex's manufacturing and administrative facilities (Note 19(b)) in accordance with EITF No. 95-3, direct acquisition costs of $1.6 million and $2.9 million in assumed debt. The fair value of our common stock issued to acquire all of Ostex's outstanding common stock was determined based on the average market price of our common stock over the periods just prior to and following the date of the merger agreement, as amended, pursuant to EITF Issue No. 99-12. The fair value of the assumed fully-vested stock options and warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition: (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,271 Accounts receivable 1,289 Inventories 467 Property, plant and equipment 604 Goodwill 25,192 Core technology 5,532 Customer relationships 1,096 Other assets 164 Accounts payable and accrued expenses (1,953 ) $ 33,662 The acquisition of Ostex is accounted for as a purchase under SFAS No. 141. Accordingly, the results of Ostex have been included in our consolidated statement of operations after the acquisition date as part of our professional diagnostic products reporting unit. Goodwill generated from this acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. We estimated the useful lives of both the core technology F-30 and customer relationships to be 15 years and have included them in core technology and patents, net and other intangible assets, net, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The weighted average amortization period for the acquired intangible assets with finite lives is 15 years. (d) Recent and Pending Acquisitions On February 28, 2006, we acquired 67.45% of the capital stock of CLONDIAG chip technologies GmbH ("CLONDIAG"), a privately held company located in Jena in Germany, which has developed a multiplexing technology for nucleic acid and immunoassay based diagnostics, in exchange for 218,502 shares of our common stock and approximately $3.1 million in cash. We also agreed to settle obligations totaling approximately $10.0 million during the first quarter of 2006, primarily using cash. Under our agreement with the CLONDIAG shareholders, we will acquire the remaining 32.55% of the capital stock of CLONDIAG on or about August 31, 2006 for an additional $4.9 million based on current exchange rates. The agreement also calls for contingent consideration totaling approximately $8.9 million consisting of 224,316 shares of our common stock and approximately $3.0 million of cash or stock in the event that four specified products are developed on CLONDIAG's platform technology during the three years following the date of the initial stock purchase. On February 24, 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement with ACON Laboratories, Inc. ("ACON") and certain of its affliliated entities to acquire (i) the assets of ACON's business of researching, developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling lateral flow immunoassay products in the United States, Canada, Europe (excluding Russia, the former Soviet Republics that are not part of the European Union and Turkey), Israel, Australia, Japan and New Zealand and (ii) all of the capital stock of entities owning a newly-constructed manufacturing facility currently undergoing validation in Hangzhou, China. The aggregate purchase price for the acquired business, including the manufacturing facility, will be between $140.0 million and $175.0 million based upon a multiple of revenues and pre-tax profits of the acquired business, though we have agreed to acquire up to $4.0 million in indebtedness related to the new manufacturing facility. The aggregate purchase price is expected to be based on completion of certain milestones related to achievement of functional manufacturing operations in certain territories. Such purchase price shall be paid by issuing an aggregate of up to $50.0 million of our common stock, but in no event more than 2,130,000 shares, with the remainder of the purchase price being paid in cash. The transaction is subject to the consent of our lenders and other ordinary and customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals. The acquisition of the lateral flow business described above is expected to close in the first or second quarter of 2006 and the acquisition of the manufacturing facility is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2006. (e) Pro Forma Financial Information The following table presents selected unaudited financial information of our company, including ADC, Viva, Ischemia, Binax, the Determine business, BioStar and IDT, as if the acquisitions of these businesses had occurred on January 1, 2004. Pro forma results exclude adjustments for ACS as the historical results of this acquisition do not materially affect our results of operations. The pro forma results are derived from the historical financial results of the acquired businesses for all periods F-31 presented and are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred had the acquisitions been consummated on January 1, 2004. 2005 2004 (unaudited) (in thousands, except per share amounts) Pro forma net revenues $ 477,239 $ 464,285 Pro forma net loss (18,387 ) (20,949 ) Pro forma net loss available to common stockholdersbasic and diluted (18,387 ) (21,698 ) Pro forma net loss per common sharebasic and diluted(1) $ (0.67 ) $ (0.83 ) (1)Net loss per share amounts are computed as described in Note 12. (5) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The following is a summary of goodwill and other intangible assets as of December 31, 2005: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Useful Life (in thousands) Amortized intangible assets: Core technology and patents $ 79,163 $ 15,113 $ 64,050 1-20 years Other intangible assets: Supplier relationships 11,020 3,616 7,404 10 years Trademarks and trade names 17,414 6,335 11,079 5-25 years License agreements 9,967 5,297 4,670 5-8.5 years Customer relationships 38,100 7,196 30,904 1.5-15 years Manufacturing know-how 7,000 720 6,280 10-15 years Other 490 338 152 2-7 years Total Other intangible assets 83,991 23,502 60,489 Total intangible assets with finite lives $ 163,154 $ 38,615 $ 124,539 Intangible assets with indefinite lives: Goodwill $ 322,210 $  $ 322,210 Other intangible assets 63,742  63,742 Total intangible assets with indefinite lives $ 385,952 $  $ 385,952 F-32 The following is a summary of goodwill and other intangible assets as of December 31, 2004: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Useful Life (in thousands) Amortized intangible assets: Core technology and patents $ 50,347 $ 10,020 $ 40,327 1-20 years Other intangible assets: Supplier relationships 11,020 2,512 8,508 10 years Trademarks and trade names 9,978 5,133 4,845 5-25 years License agreements 9,747 3,912 5,835 7-8.5 years Customer related intangible assets 9,191 4,277 4,914 1.5-15 years Manufacturing know-how 3,500 311 3,189 15 years Other 530 141 389 2-3 years Total Other intangible assets 43,966 16,286 27,680 Total intangible assets with finite lives $ 94,313 $ 26,306 $ 68,007 Intangible assets with indefinite lives: Goodwill $ 221,155 $  $ 221,155 Other intangible assets 50,542  50,542 Total intangible assets with indefinite lives $ 271,697 $  $ 271,697 We amortize intangible assets with finite lives using primarily the straight-line method over the above estimated useful lives of the respective intangible asset. We believe that the straight-line method is appropriate, as it approximates the pattern in which economic benefits are consumed in circumstances where such patterns can be reliably determined. Amortization expense of intangible assets, which in the aggregate amounted to $12.9 million, $10.4 million and $6.3 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, is included in cost of sales, research and development and sales and marketing in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The allocation of amortization expense to the expense categories is based on the intended usage and the expected benefits of the intangible assets in relation to the expense categories. The following is a summary of estimated aggregate amortization expense of intangible assets for each of the five succeeding fiscal years as of December 31, 2005: (in thousands) 2006 $ 15,455 2007 $ 15,316 2008 $ 15,027 2009 $ 13,369 2010 $ 12,821 In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we perform annual impairment tests of the carrying value of our goodwill by reporting unit. Our annual impairment review on September 30, 2005, did not indicate that goodwill related to our consumer diagnostic products and professional diagnostic products F-33 reporting units were impaired. The values assigned to the trade names that were acquired as part of our acquisition have been assigned indefinite lives and therefore, in accordance with SFAS No. 142 are not being amortized. We allocate goodwill by reporting unit based on the relative percentage of estimated future revenues generated for the respective reporting unit as of the acquisition date. Goodwill amounts allocated to our consumer diagnostic products and professional diagnostic products reporting units are summarized as follows: Consumer Diagnostic Products Professional Diagnostic Products Total (in thousands) Goodwill, at December 31, 2003 $ 86,676 $ 130,057 $ 216,733 Acquisitions (Note 4 (b))  4,858 4,858 Other(1) (598 ) 162 (436 ) Goodwill, at December 31, 2004 86,078 135,077 221,155 Acquisitions (Note 4 (a))  103,815 103,815 Other(1) (904 ) (1,857 ) (2,760 ) Goodwill, at December 31, 2005 $ 85,174 $ 237,035 $ 322,210 (1)These amounts relate primarily to adjustments resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We generally expense costs incurred to internally develop intangible assets, except for costs that are incurred to establish patents and trademarks, such as legal fees for initiating, filing and obtaining the patents and trademarks. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $2.0 million of costs capitalized in connection with establishing patents and trademarks which are included in other intangible assets, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Upon the successful registration of the patents and trademarks, we commence amortization of such intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Costs incurred to maintain the patents and trademarks are expensed as incurred. F-34 (6) Long-term Debt We had the following long-term debt balances outstanding: December 31, 2005 2004 (in thousands) Senior credit facilities $ 89,000 $ 20,053 8.75% Senior Subordinated notes 150,000 150,000 10% Subordinated notes 20,000 20,000 Line of credit 2,212  Other 316 47 261,528 190,100 Less: Unamortized original issue discount (544 ) (744 ) Less: Current portion (2,367 ) (88 ) $ 258,617 $ 189,268 The following describes each of the above listed debt instruments: (a) Senior Credit Facilities On November 14, 2002, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a senior credit agreement with a group of banks for credit facilities in the aggregate amount of up to $55.0 million, of which $44.1 million was used to prepay the outstanding principal balances and any accrued and unpaid interest on the term loans and line of credit under a series of former credit agreements. During 2003, to finance the cash portions of our acquisitions of ABI and the Abbott business (Note 4(c)), we amended the senior credit agreement, whereby the borrowing capacity under the credit facilities was increased to $135.0 million. The amended senior credit facilities of up to $135.0 million in borrowings consisted of two U.S. term loans, Term Loan A for $35.1 million and Term Loan B for $40.0 million, a European term loan for $9.9 million, a U.S. revolving line of credit of up to $25.0 million, and a European revolving line of credit of up to $25.0 million. On February 10, 2004, all outstanding borrowings and accrued and unpaid interest under the amended senior credit agreement, aggregating $125.0 million, were prepaid with the proceeds from our sale of $150.0 million of 8.75% senior subordinated notes (the "Bonds" or "Bond issuance") (Note 6(b)). We treated the prepayment of the outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facilities, using the proceeds from the Bond offering, as a refinancing in accordance with SFAS No. 6, Classification of Short-Term Obligations Expected to Be Refinanced. We retained the $50.0 million availability under the revolving lines of credit, subject to continued covenant compliance. On June 30, 2005, we amended and restated our existing senior credit facility. The amendment expanded our existing revolving credit facility capacity from $50.0 million to $80.0 million and added a $20.0 million term loan facility. Upon completion of the amendment, we borrowed $58.0 million to finance our acquisition of the Determine business. In August, 2005, we sold 4.0 million shares of our common stock to three accredited institutional investors in a private placement. Net proceeds from the private placement were approximately $92.8 million. Of this amount, we repaid principal and interest outstanding under senior credit facility of $84.4 million, with the remainder of the net proceeds retained for general corporate purposes. $20.0 million of the repayment was used to permanently reduce the outstanding term loan balance under the senior credit facility. The repayment of the term F-35 loan balance resulted in a non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs of $0.1 million during the third quarter of 2005. On September 29, 2005, we again amended the senior credit facility to increase the total amount of credit available to us under the senior credit facility, which consists of two revolving lines of credit, from $80.0 million to $100.0 million. As of December 31, 2005, $89.0 million of borrowings were outstanding under the lines, with $11.0 million available for future borrowings, subject to continued covenant compliance. Borrowings under the revolving lines of credit bear interest at either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), as defined in the agreement, plus applicable margins or, at our option or (ii) a floating Index Rate, as defined in the agreement, plus applicable margins. Applicable margins, if we choose to use the LIBOR or the Index Rate, can range from 2.75% to 3.75% or 1.50% to 2.50%, respectively, depending on the quarterly adjustments that are based on our consolidated financial performance, commencing with the quarter ending March 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2005, the interest rate under the revolving lines of credit, including the applicable margin, ranged from 6.84% to 9.25%. We recorded interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, under these senior credit facilities in the aggregate amount of $2.3 million, $2.0 million and $4.6 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, accrued interest related to the senior credit facility amounted to $0.5 million. On February 10, 2004, in connection with the prepayment of the outstanding balances under the senior credit agreement, we also recorded additional interest expense of $3.6 million relating to the write-off of the remaining related unamortized deferred financing costs of $3.1 million and a financing fee of $0.5 million paid to the banks. Borrowings under the senior credit facilities are secured by the stock of certain of our U.S. and European subsidiaries, substantially all of our intellectual property rights and the assets of our business in the U.S. and Europe, excluding those assets of Orgenics Ltd., our Israeli subsidiary, Inverness Medical Shanghai Co., Ltd., our subsidiary in China, Inverness Medical Australia Pty. Ltd., our Australian subsidiary and Unipath Scandinavia AB, our Swedish subsidiary, and the stock of Orgenics Ltd. and certain smaller subsidiaries. Under the senior credit agreement, as amended, we must comply with various financial and non-financial covenants. The primary financial covenants pertain to, among other things, fixed charge coverage ratio, capital expenditure, various leverage ratios, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and minimum cash requirement. Additionally, the senior credit agreement currently prohibits us from paying dividends. As of December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with the covenants. (b) Senior Subordinated Notes, 8.75%, Principal Amount $150.0 million On February 10, 2004, we completed the sale of $150.0 million of 8.75% Bonds due 2012 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. Net proceeds from this offering amounted to $145.9 million, which was net of underwriters' commissions of $4.1 million. Of the net proceeds, we used $125.3 million to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness and related financing fees under our primary senior credit facility (Note 6(a)) and $9.2 million to prepay our outstanding 9% subordinated promissory notes and related prepayment penalties (Note 6(d)). The remaining $11.4 million of proceeds was used for Bond offering expenses and general corporate purposes. The Bonds accrue interest from the date of their issuance, or February 10, 2004, at the rate of 8.75% per year. Interest on the Bonds are payable semi-annually in arrears on each February 15 and F-36 August 15, which commenced on August 15, 2004. In addition, under the related registration rights agreement, we were to cause the registration statement with the SEC with respect to a registered exchange offer to exchange the notes underlying the Bonds for new notes, to be declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, within 240 days after the date of the Bonds issuance and consummate the exchange offer within 270 days after the date of the Bonds issuance. As we were unable to consummate the exchange offer until March 28, 2005, interest on the bonds increased by 0.25% point per year for the first 90-day period immediately following the default (from November 7, 2004 to February 4, 2005) and an additional 0.25% point per year until March 28, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, accrued interest related to the bonds amounted to $4.9 million. We may redeem the Bonds, in whole or in part, at any time on or after February 15, 2008, at redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a premium declining ratably to par, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, prior to February 15, 2007, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds issued with the proceeds of qualified equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 108.75% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If we experience a change of control, we may be required to offer to purchase the Bonds at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We might not be able to pay the required price for Bonds presented to us at the time of a change of control because our primary senior credit facility or other indebtedness may prohibit payment or we might not have enough funds at that time. The Bonds are unsecured and are subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt, including the guarantee of all borrowings under our senior credit facilities. The Bonds are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities, including trade payables, of those of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Bonds. The Bonds are guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries that are guarantors or borrowers under our primary senior credit facility. The guarantees are general unsecured obligations of the guarantors and are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior debt of the applicable guarantors, which includes their guarantees of, and borrowings under our primary senior credit facility. See Note 20 for guarantor financial information. The indenture governing the Bonds contains covenants that will limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness in the aggregate, subject to our interest coverage ratio, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our stock, make investments, sell assets, incur liens, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications. (c) Subordinated Promissory Notes, 10%, Principal Amount $20.0 million On September 20, 2002, we sold units ("Units") having an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million to private investors to help finance the Wampole acquisition. Each Unit consisted of (i) a 10% subordinated promissory note (a "10% Subordinated Note") in the principal amount of $50,000 and (ii) a warrant to acquire 0.4 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $13.54 per share. In the aggregate, we issued fully vested warrants to purchase 0.2 million shares of our common stock, which may be exercised at any time on or prior to September 20, 2012. Interest accrues at 10% per annum, compounded daily, on the outstanding principal amount and is payable quarterly in arrears on F-37 the first day of each calendar quarter, which started on October 1, 2002. The 10% Subordinated Notes mature on September 20, 2008, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances, and we may prepay the 10% Subordinated Notes at any time, subject to certain prepayment penalties. We may, at our option, repay the 10% Subordinated Notes and pay any prepayment penalty, if applicable, in cash or in shares of our common stock valued at 95% of the average closing price of such stock over the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the payment date. The 10% Subordinated Notes are expressly subordinated to up to $150.0 million of indebtedness for borrowed money incurred or guaranteed by our company plus any other indebtedness that we incur to finance an acquisition. As of December 31, 2005, accrued interest related to the 10% Subordinated Notes amounted to $0.5 million. All warrants issued in relation to this debt have been classified in equity, pursuant to the provisions of EITF No. 00-19, Determination of Whether Share Settlement Is within the Control of the Issuer for Purposes of Applying EITF Issue No. 96-13, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock. Among the purchasers of the 10% Subordinated Notes were three directors and officers of our company and an entity controlled by our chief executive officer, who collectively purchased Units that aggregated $1.9 million in principal amount and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 15,000 shares of our common stock. (d) Subordinated Promissory Notes, 9%, Principal Amount $9 million, and Convertible Subordinated Promissory Notes, 3%, Principal Amount $6 million On September 20, 2002, also in connection with the financing of the Wampole acquisition, we sold subordinated promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of $9.0 million (the "9% Subordinated Notes") and subordinated convertible promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of $6.0 million (the "3% Convertible Notes") to private investors. The 9% Subordinated Notes and 3% Convertible Notes bore interest at 9% and 3% per annum, respectively, on the outstanding principal balance. We recorded interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, on these notes of $0.5 million and $1.0 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. On February 10, 2004, we prepaid the 9% Subordinated Notes with the proceeds from the Bond issuance (Note 6(b)). The total payment made on the prepayment date aggregated $9.3 million, which represented the principal balance outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest as well as a prepayment penalty of $0.2 million, which equated to 2% of the principal balance repaid. The prepayment penalty along with the remaining unamortized deferred financing cost write-off, aggregating $0.2 million, was charged to interest expense in February 2004. The 3% Convertible Notes were set to mature on September 20, 2008, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances. In addition, the outstanding principal amount and unpaid interest on the 3% convertible notes would automatically convert into common stock at a conversion price equal to $17.45 if, at any time after September 20, 2004, the average closing price of our common stock in any consecutive thirty day period was greater than $22.67, which event occurred on December 8, 2004. Consequently, on December 8, 2004, the 3% Convertible Notes and accrued and unpaid interest converted into 0.3 million shares of our common stock. An entity controlled by our chief executive officer purchased 3% Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 million. F-38 (e) IMN Credit Facilities In connection with the acquisition of IMN, we assumed IMN's borrowings under a senior credit agreement ("IMN Credit Agreement"). Pursuant to the IMN Credit Agreement, as amended, IMN could borrow up to $15.0 million under a revolving credit commitment and $4.2 million under a term loan commitment, subject to specified borrowing base limitations. In October 2004, we repaid the then outstanding borrowings under the IMN Credit Agreement of $14.2 million using borrowings under our senior credit facility (Note 6(a)) and terminated the IMN Credit Agreement. Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, related to borrowings under the IMN Credit Agreement amounted to $0.7 million and $0.8 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Upon repayment of borrowings under the IMN Credit Agreement, IMN became a U.S. credit party under our senior credit facility (Note 6(a)) and a guarantor under the Bonds (Notes 6(b) and 20). (f) IMN Bonds Payable Also in connection with the acquisition of IMN, we assumed IMN's bonds payable ("IMN Bonds"). The bonds were payable in various installments through June 30, 2007 and the bonds payable balance bore interest at 6.90%. Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, related to the IMN Bonds amounted to $0.1 million during both 2004 and 2003. In October 2004, we prepaid the outstanding principal balances and any unpaid interest under the IMN Bonds Payable, aggregating $1.6 million, with borrowings from the senior credit facilities (Note 6(a)). (g) Maturities of Long-term Debt The following is a summary of the maturities of long-term debt outstanding on December 31, 2005: (in thousands) 2006 $ 2,367 2007 143 2008 109,018 2009  2010  Thereafter 150,000 261,528 Less: Unamortized original issue discount (544 ) $ 260,984 (7) Capital Leases Our subsidiary IMN maintains a capital lease for its warehouse and distribution facility, which expires in July 2008 and is renewable for two successive five-year periods. This lease was classified as a capital lease as a result of a sale-leaseback transaction that IMN entered into prior to our acquisition of IMN. In July 2005, the facility and the related capital lease were transferred to another subsidiary of ours, IMI Nutritionals. The aggregate monthly minimum payments remaining under this capital lease are $1.5 million as of December 31, 2005. In addition, we have various other capital leases for certain machinery and equipment and computer equipment that expire at various dates through 2009, with F-39 remaining aggregate monthly minimum payments of $0.2 million. The following is a schedule of the future minimum lease payments under the capital leases, together with the present value of such payments as of December 31, 2005: (in thousands) 2006 $ 644 2007 643 2008 392 2009 12 2010  Total future minimum lease payments 1,691 Less: Imputed interest (171 ) Present value of future minimum lease payments 1,520 Less: Current portion (542 ) $ 978 At December 31, 2005, the capitalized amounts of the building, machinery and equipment and computer equipment under the capital leases were as follows: (in thousands) Machinery, laboratory equipment and tooling $ 198 Buildings 2,186 2,384 Less: Accumulated amortization (1,322 ) $ 1,062 The amortization expense of assets recorded under capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense of property, plant and equipment. (8) Postretirement Benefit Plans (a) Employee Savings Plans Our company and several of our U.S. based subsidiaries sponsor various 401(k) savings plans, to which eligible domestic employees may voluntarily contribute a portion of their income, subject to statutory limitations. In addition to the participants' own contributions to these 401(k) savings plans, we match such contributions up to a designated level. Total matching contributions related to employee savings plans were $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $0.3 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (b) UK Pension Plans Our subsidiary in England, Unipath Ltd. ("Unipath"), adopted a pension plan (the "Unipath Pension Scheme") in December 2002. The Unipath Pension Scheme consists of two parts: (i) the defined benefit section (the "Defined Benefit Plan"), and (ii) the defined contribution section (the F-40 "Defined Contribution Plan"). Employees of Unipath were allowed to join the Unipath Pension Scheme starting on December 1, 2002. As part of the purchase agreement of the Unipath business in December 2001, we agreed to establish a new defined benefit pension plan for the acquired employees based in England, who are former participants of the Unilever pension plan (the "Acquired UK Employees"), and to continue to accumulate benefits under such plan for a period of at least three years after the acquisition date of the Unipath business. Consequently, the Defined Benefit Plan was established as part of the Unipath Pension Scheme, which covers the Acquired UK Employees during the last two years of the three year post-acquisition period starting on December 1, 2002. During the first year of the three year post-acquisition period through November 2002, the Acquired UK Employees continued to accumulate benefits under the Unilever pension plan, to which Unipath contributed $1.9 million in that period. At the time of the acquisition, pursuant to SFAS No. 87, Employer's Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 88, Employer's Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, we recorded an unfunded pension liability of $3.7 million as part of the purchase price of the Unipath business (withdrawal obligation). Such unfunded pension liability represented the excess of the benefit obligation, or $20.5 million over the fair value of the plan assets, or $16.8 million, initially allocated by Unilever to the plan assets for the benefit of the Acquired UK Employees. As some of the Acquired UK Employees were terminated under our restructuring plan upon acquisition, the unfunded pension liability initially recorded by us, or $3.7 million, was reduced by the portion of these employees' severance pay-out that represented pension benefits, or $1.1 million, which was reclassified to severance costs for purposes of aggregating the purchase price of the Unipath business. The net remaining unfunded pension liability of $2.6 million is included in the benefit obligation in the tables which follow. Through November 2004, the Acquired UK Employees could elect, at their option, to transfer contributions and benefits from the Unilever pension plan to the Defined Benefit Plan. As required, we had established the Defined Benefit Plan and believed that the benefits available under this plan were no less favorable to the Acquired UK Employees than Unilever's plan and we maintained these benefits for the period required by the acquisition agreement. Nevertheless, we were engaged in a dispute with Unilever over the equity of benefits under the old and new plans. During May 2004, we entered into mediation with Unilever to resolve the differences over the relative levels of benefits in Unilever's Plan and the Defined Benefit Plan. The mediation produced a settlement agreement between Unilever and us dated August 17, 2004. This settlement agreement provided that we would match certain benefits available in the Unilever plan to ensure that the plan was viewed as being no less favorable than the Unilever plan for employees considering whether to transition in November of 2004. These changes increased the benefits available to a retiree under the Defined Benefit Plan to: (i) allow for retirees upon retirement to receive unreduced benefits at age 60 rather than age 65; and (ii) calculate the final pension benefit payable to retirees based on the retirees salary at the date on which pension benefits ceased accruing under the Unipath plan (December 2004) plus 1% over inflation for each year of service after December 2004 until retirement. In November 2004, the final number of employees who elected to transfer into the Defined Benefit Plan from the Unilever plan was determined. Substantially fewer Acquired UK Employees transferred into the Defined Benefit Plan than were previously anticipated to transfer when the F-41 unfunded pension liability was initially established in 2001. As a result, an actuarial gain of $1.8 million was recorded and deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in 2004. The following table sets forth an analysis of the changes in the benefit obligation, the plan assets and the funded status of the Defined Benefit Plan during 2005 and 2004: 2005 2004 (in thousands) Change in projected benefit obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 11,646 $ 5,003 Service cost  1,712 Interest cost 583 183 Plan participants' contributions  577 Plan amendments  4,926 Actuarial (gain) loss 258 (1,315 ) Benefits paid (122 ) (128 ) Foreign exchange impact (1,221 ) 688 Benefit obligation at end of year $ 11,144 $ 11,646 Change in accumulated benefit obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 8,304 $ 5,003 Service cost  1,712 Interest cost 583 183 Plan participants' contributions  577 Plan amendments  1,740 Actuarial (gain) loss 258 (1,315 ) Benefits paid (122 ) (128 ) Foreign exchange impact (882 ) 532 Benefit obligation at end of year $ 8,141 $ 8,304 Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 5,327 $ 1,964 Actual return on plan assets 1,316 73 Employer contribution 546 2,536 Plan participants' contributions  577 Benefits paid (122 ) (128 ) Foreign exchange impact (631 ) 305 Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 6,436 $ 5,327 Funded status $ (4,708 ) $ (6,319 ) Unrecognized net actuarial (gain) loss (1,414 ) (780 ) Unrecognized prior service cost 5,967 6,642 Net amount recognized $ (155 ) $ (457 ) F-42 The net amount recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet that relates to the Defined Benefit Plan during 2005 and 2004 consists of: 2005 2004 (in thousands) Accrued benefit liability $ (1,672 ) $ (3,085 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income   Intangible asset 1,517 2,628 Net amount recognized $ (155 ) $ (457 ) The measurement date used to determine plan assets and benefit obligations for the Defined Benefit Plan was December 31, 2005 and 2004. The following table provides the weighted-average actuarial assumptions: 2005 2004 Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations: Discount rate 4.80 % 5.30 % Rate of compensation increase 3.55 % 3.55 % Assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost: Discount rate 5.30 % 5.50 % Expected return on plan assets 6.84 % 6.00 % Rate of compensation increase 3.55 % 4.25 % The actuarial assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis. The overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption was determined based on historical investment return rates on portfolios with a high proportion of equity securities. The annual cost of the Defined Benefit Plan is as follows: 2005 2004 (in thousands) Service cost $  $ 1,712 Interest cost 583 183 Expected return on plan assets (360 ) (183 ) Recognition of prior service cost  1,099 Amortization of net loss 54 24 Net periodic benefit cost $ 277 $ 2,835 The plan assets of the Defined Benefit Plan comprise of a mix of stocks and fixed income securities and other investments. At December 31, 2005, these stocks and fixed income securities represented 70% and 30%, respectively, of the market value of the pension assets. We expect to contribute approximately 0.3 million British Pounds Sterling (or $0.5 million at December 31, 2005) to the Defined Benefit Plan in 2006. We expect benefits to be paid to plan participants of approximately $0.1 million per year for each of the next five years and for benefits totaling $0.2 million to be paid annually for the five years thereafter. F-43 Unipath contributed $1.1 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million to the Defined Contribution Plan, which was recognized as an expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations, in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (9) Derivative Instrument We entered into an interest rate swap agreement with one of our lenders, effective February 25, 2002, which was intended to protect our long-term debt on which interest was charged at the LIBOR against fluctuation in such rate. Under the interest rate swap agreement, the LIBOR was set at a minimum of 3.36% and a maximum of 5.00%. Because the interest rate swap agreement did not qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes under SFAS No. 133 and related amendments, we recorded income of $0.7 million and $0.5 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively, to mark to market this interest rate swap agreement. The adjustment to fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a component of interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The interest rate swap agreement expired on December 30, 2004. During 2005, we entered into forward exchange contracts totaling $24.9 million with monthly maturity dates of January 18, 2005 to February 15, 2006. Maturing forward exchange contracts were used to lock in U.S. dollar to British Pound Sterling (GBP) or U.S. dollar to Euro exchange rates and hedge anticipated intercompany sales. The change in value of the derivative was analyzed quarterly for changes in the spot and forward rates based on rates given by the issuing financial institution for each quarter end date. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported in other comprehensive income ("OCI") during the period prior to the forecasted purchase or sale. For forecasted sales on credit, the amount of income ascribed to each forecasted period was reclassified from OCI to income or expense on the date of the sale. The income or cost ascribed to each period encompassed within the periods of the recognized foreign-currency-denominated receivable or payable was reclassified from OCI to income or expense at the end of each reporting period. The changes in the derivative instrument's fair values from inception of the hedge were compared to the cumulative change in the hedged item's fair value attributable to the risk hedged. Effectiveness was based on the change in the spot rates. At December 31, 2005, we had two forward exchange contracts outstanding for $1.5 million each against the GBP. The contracts maturing during January and February 2006 effectively hedge existing receivables and therefore are considered fair value hedges and accordingly, as of December 31, 2005, the forward contracts remain effective against future exchange rate changes. F-44 (10) Commitments and Contingencies (a) Operating Leases We have operating lease commitments for certain of our facilities and equipment that expire on various dates through 2021. The following schedule outlines future minimum annual rental payments under these leases at December 31, 2005: (in thousands) 2006 $ 7,551 2007 6,140 2008 4,773 2009 4,281 2010 3,788 Thereafter 30,393 $ 56,926 Rent expense relating to operating leases was approximately $10.0 million, $7.4 million and $5.8 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The operations of the Unipath business in England are currently housed in a 150,000 square foot manufacturing, research and office facility in Bedford, England. The lease of this facility is between Unilever and a third party landlord and the Unipath business in England continues to use the facility pursuant to an agreement with Unilever in connection with the acquisition. Future minimum annual rent payments under this facility lease range from 1.5 million British Pounds Sterling to 1.6 million British Pounds Sterling (approximately $2.6 million to $2.7 million) with upward adjustments every 5 years, but only to the extent the rent is below market rate. The lease expires in December 2021. Unilever has agreed to use its best efforts to obtain the landlord's consent, which consent is required under the lease agreement and cannot be unreasonably withheld, so it may assign the lease to us for our remaining term. Because we are required to pay all amounts owed under the lease, as agreed upon at the acquisition, we have included in the table above all future minimum lease payments under this facility lease. If Unilever is unable to successfully assign the lease to us or otherwise enable us to realize the benefit of our lease of the Bedford facility, we may be forced to renegotiate a lease of this facility on substantially less favorable terms, seek alternative, more costly means of producing our products or suffer other adverse effects to our business. (b) Capital Expenditure Commitments At December 31, 2005, we had total outstanding non-cancelable equipment purchase commitments of $5.0 million. (c) Legal Proceedings We currently are not a party to any material pending legal proceedings. Because of the nature of our business, we may be subject at any particular time to consumer product claims or various other lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business, including employment matters, and expect that this will continue to be the case in the future. Such lawsuits generally seek damages, sometimes in substantial amounts, for personal injuries or other commercial or F-45 employment claims. In addition, we aggressively defend our patent and other intellectual property rights. This often involves bringing infringement or other commercial claims against third parties. These suits can be expensive and result in counterclaims challenging the validity of our patents and other rights. In addition, in December 2005 we learned that the Enforcement Division of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had issued a formal order of investigation in connection with the previously disclosed revenue recognition matter at one of our diagnostic divisions, and we subsequently received a subpoena for documents. We believe that we fully responded to the subpoena and we will continue to fully cooperate with the SEC's investigation. We cannot predict whether the SEC will seek additional information or what the outcome of its investigation will be. On February 2, 2005, our IMN subsidiary received $8.4 million representing its pro rata share of the net funds which were disbursed in connection with the settlement of class action suits against several raw material suppliers. The class action suits alleged that certain defendants unlawfully agreed to fix prices of certain vitamin products sold in the United States. IMN's recovery represented 7.3% of its approved purchases from the settling parties during the period in which the price fixing was alleged. The $8.4 million is included in other income, net, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. On April 6, 2005, we entered into a binding settlement agreement of our pending litigation with Princeton BioMeditech Corporation ("PBM") pursuant to which we paid $2.5 million in resolution of all pending litigation with PBM. PBM also received an option to permanently settle certain claims against our ABI subsidiary, that are not part of any pending case in exchange for $1.8 million of collaborative research and development funding from us. In connection with this settlement arrangement, we recorded a $4.2 million charge which is included in other income, net, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. On April 27, 2005, we entered into a settlement agreement with Quidel Corporation ("Quidel") terminating all domestic and international intellectual property litigation with them. Under the settlement agreement, we received a net payment of $17.0 million and net future royalties from Quidel at 8.5%, in exchange for a license to all of our current and future patents which embody lateral flow technology for all diagnostic products other than for cardiology testing and for consumer/over-the-counter women's health (except that diagnostics for women's infectious diseases are within the licensed field of use). Quidel and its affiliates have granted a net royalty free cross-license of their current and future patents that embody lateral flow technology to us and all of our affiliates for all applications. The payment of $17.0 million is included in our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2005, of which $15.0 million related to periods prior to 2005 and has been included in other income, net, and the remainder has been recorded as license revenues. On June 16, 2005, we entered into a license arrangement with British BioCell International Limited ("British BioCell"). As part of this agreement, we licensed to them our lateral flow intellectual property for use in certain defined areas not competitive with existing businesses in return for royalties on future sales totaling between 10% and 25% of net revenues, depending on the amounts of revenue earned. As part of the arrangement, we also received an option to acquire 25% of British BioCell's parent company, BBI Holdings, PLC, a UK public company. We valued the option at $2.6 million using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and have included the value received in other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2005. The investment, which is not readily convertible to cash, has been F-46 recorded at cost and will be evaluated at least annually for impairment, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate. On September 23, 2005, an arbitrator issued a final award against our IMN subsidiary in favor of Sunlight Distribution, Inc. for damages in the amount of $1.8 million plus interest, fees and costs arising out of a distribution arrangement dated September 1996. We have accrued $2.9 million as of December 31, 2005 to provide for the final award. The corresponding expenses were recorded in other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2005. (11) Other Arrangements (a) Co-development Agreement with ITI Scotland Limited On February 25, 2005, we entered into a co-development agreement with ITI Scotland Limited ("ITI"), whereby ITI agreed to provide us with approximately 30 million British Pounds Sterling (or $51.8 million at December 31, 2005) over three years to partially fund research and development programs focused on identifying novel biomarkers and near-patient and home use tests for cardiovascular and other diseases ("the programs"). We agreed to invest 37.5 million British Pounds Sterling (or $64.7 million at December 31, 2005) in the programs over the next three years. Through our subsidiary, Stirling Medical Innovations Limited ("Stirling"), we established a new research center in Stirling, Scotland, where we will consolidate many of our existing cardiology programs and ultimately commercialize products arising from the programs. ITI and Stirling will have exclusive rights to the developed technology in their respective fields of use. As of December 31, 2005, we had received approximately $22.5 million in funding from ITI. As qualified expenditures are made under the co-development arrangement, we recognize the fee earned during the period as a reduction of our related expenses, subject to certain limitations. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized $18.1 million of reimbursements, of which $17.2 million offset our research and development spending and $0.9 million reduced our general, administrative and marketing spending incurred by Stirling. Funds received from ITI in excess of amounts earned are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, the balance of which was $4.4 million as of December 31, 2005. (b) Joint Venture in China In September 2004, we began manufacturing a small amount of product in China through a third party. In February 2005, we entered into a joint venture with this Chinese manufacturer and acquired controlling ownership of the manufacturing facility. We consolidate 100% of this entity. F-47 (12) (Loss) Income per Share The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted (loss) income per share: 2005 2004 2003 (restated) (restated) (in thousands, except per share amounts) Numerator: Net (loss) income $ (19,209 ) $ (16,596 ) $ 8,653 Dividends, redemption interest and amortization of beneficial conversion feature related to Series A Preferred Stock (Note 13(b))  (749 ) (958 ) Net (loss) income available to common stockholdersbasic and diluted $ (19,209 ) $ (17,345 ) $ 7,695 Denominator: Denominator for basic (loss) income per shareweighted average shares 24,358 19,969 15,711 Effect of dilutive securities: Employee stock options   635 Warrants   213 Restricted stock and escrow shares   931 Potential dilutive common shares   1,779 Denominator for dilutive (loss) income per shareadjusted weighted average shares and assumed conversions 24,358 19,969 17,490 Net (loss) income per sharebasic $ (0.79 ) $ (0.87 ) $ 0.49 Net (loss) income per sharediluted $ (0.79 ) $ (0.87 ) $ 0.44 We had the following potential dilutive securities outstanding on December 31, 2005: (a) options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4.7 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $18.44 per share and (b) 104,000 shares of common stock held in escrow. Potential dilutive securities were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share in 2005 because the inclusion thereof would be antidilutive. We had the following potential dilutive securities outstanding on December 31, 2004: options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4.3 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $16.43 per share. Potential dilutive securities were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share in 2004 because the inclusion thereof would be antidilutive. We had the following potential dilutive securities outstanding on December 31, 2003: (a) options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 0.8 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $22.87 per share, (b) 3% Convertible Notes convertible into an aggregate of 0.3 million shares of our common stock and (c) Series A Preferred Stock convertible into an aggregate of 0.4 million shares of our common stock. Such potential dilutive securities were not included in the calculation of diluted income per share in 2003 because the inclusion thereof, together with the add back of the related interest and dividends, would be antidilutive. F-48 (13) Stockholders' Equity (a) Common Stock As of December 31, 2005, we had 50.0 million shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, authorized, of which approximately 27.5 million shares were issued and outstanding, 3.9 million shares were reserved for issuance upon grant and exercise of stock options under current stock option plans and 0.8 million shares were reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants. On August 1, 2005, we sold 4.0 million shares of our common stock at $23.76 per share to funds affiliated with three accredited institutional investors in a private placement. Proceeds from the private placement were approximately $92.8 million, net of issuance costs of $2.5 million. Of this amount, we repaid principal and interest outstanding under our senior credit facility of $84.4 million, with the remainder of the net proceeds retained for general corporate purposes. On February 8 and 9, 2006, we sold 3.4 million shares of our common stock at $24.41 per share to funds affiliated with 14 accredited institutional investors in a private placement. Proceeds from the private placement were approximately $79.3 million, net of issuance costs of $3.7 million. Of this amount, we repaid principal and interest outstanding under our senior credit facility of $74.1 million, with the remainder of the net proceeds retained for general corporate purposes. In connection with the February 2006 private placements of common stock, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to register the private placement shares prior to June 8, 2006. In the event that we are unable to take a registration statement effective prior to June 8, 2006, we will pay an illiquidity discount equal to 1% of the February 2006 offering proceeds per month until the earlier of (i) the date that the registration statement is declared effective or (ii) February 8, 2008. (b) Preferred Stock As of December 31, 2005, we had 5.0 million shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value, authorized, of which 2.7 million shares were designated as Series A Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value. On March 6, 2002, we sold to private investors 0.5 million shares of Series A Preferred Stock at $39.01 per share for gross proceeds of $20.8 million. On December 20, 2001, we sold to private investors 2.0 million shares of Series A Preferred Stock at $30.00 per share for gross proceeds of $59.9 million. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, 0.2 million, 0.1 million and 2.2 million shares of Series A Preferred Stock, respectively, were converted into 0.4 million, 0.2 million and 4.4 million shares of our common stock, respectively. No shares of Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2005. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock accrued dividends on a quarterly basis at $2.10 per annum, but only on those trading days when the closing price of our common stock was less than $15.00. As a result, we recorded dividends of $33,000 during 2003, which reduced earnings available to common stockholders in the computation of earnings per share (Note 12). No dividends were recorded in 2004, as our stock price did not close below $15.00 during the period in 2004 in which shares of Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding. Dividends accrued were payable only if declared by the Board of Directors. No dividends were declared by the Board of Directors prior to the conversion of any of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The effective purchase price for the shares of common stock underlying the Series A Preferred Stock issued on March 6, 2002 and December 20, 2001 represented a discount of $2.70 (or 12%) and $2.00 (or 11.8%), respectively, to the fair value of our common stock on the respective issuance dates. In accordance with EITF Issue No. 98-5 and EITF Issue No. 00-27, we recorded a beneficial F-49 conversion feature in the form of a discount on the two issuances of Series A Preferred Stock of $2.9 million and $8.0 million, respectively, which was being amortized to accumulated deficit over the redemption period, as discussed below. The amortization of this discount reduces earnings available to common stockholders in the computation of earnings per share. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, we amortized $0, $0.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of such discount, of which $0, $0.7 million, and $0.4 million, respectively, represented acceleration of amortization due to conversions of Series A Preferred Stock. Had the Series A Preferred Stock not been converted to common stock, the redemption price per share of Series A Preferred Stock would have been equal to $30.00 plus accrued redemption interest calculated at 5% per annum from the date of issuance. We recorded accrued redemption interest of $0, $10,000, and $0.4 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which reduced earnings available to common stockholders in the computation of earnings per share (Note 12). (c) Stock Options and Awards In 2001, we adopted the 2001 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "2001 Plan") which allows for the issuance of up to 6.1 million shares of common stock and other awards, as amended. The 2001 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in order to select the individuals eligible to receive awards, determine or modify the terms and conditions of the awards granted, accelerate the vesting schedule of any award and generally administer and interpret the 2001 Plan. The key terms of the 2001 Plan permit the granting of incentive or nonqualified stock options with a term of up to ten years and the granting of stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, unrestricted stock awards, performance share awards and dividend equivalent rights. The 2001 Plan also provides for option grants to non-employee directors and automatic vesting acceleration of all options and stock appreciation rights upon a change in control, as defined by the 2001 Plan. As of December 31, 2005, there were 0.4 million shares available for future grant under the 2001 plan. On August 15, 2001, we sold to our chief executive officer 1.2 million shares of restricted common stock at a price of $9.13 per share. Two-thirds of the restricted stock, or 0.8 million shares, vest ratably over 36 months; the remaining one-third, or 0.4 million shares, vests ratably over 48 months. Except for the par value of the common stock, which was paid in cash, the chief executive officer purchased the restricted stock with a five-year promissory note, which, for accounting purposes, was treated as a non-recourse note. The total interest under the promissory note is fully recourse to our chief executive officer. The balance of the promissory note is recorded as a note receivable and is classified in stockholders' equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The note is due and payable on August 16, 2006 and bears interest at an annual rate of 4.99%. Interest income recorded under this note amounted to $0.5 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. We accounted for this arrangement pursuant to FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, EITF Issue No. 95-16, Accounting for Stock Compensation Arrangements with Employer Loan Features under APB Opinion No. 25, and EITF Issue No. 00-23, Issues Related to Accounting for Stock Compensation under APB Opinion No. 25 and FASB Interpretation No. 44. Accordingly, on November 20, 2001, the date on which this arrangement was approved by the stockholders, we measured total compensation expense to be approximately $10.6 million based on the intrinsic value of the stock on that date. The amount of compensation expense is deferred and amortized ratably over the vesting periods of the restricted stock because, under the terms of the original restricted stock agreement, we could repurchase unvested shares at cost F-50 in certain circumstances. In February 2002, the terms of the restricted stock agreement were amended, pursuant to which we may repurchase unvested shares at the then fair value in certain circumstances. Also, in connection with this amendment, the chief executive officer surrendered 50,000 shares of his nonqualified stock options. Because the repurchase rights on unvested shares are at fair value subsequent to the amendment in February 2002, we fully amortized the remaining portion of the deferred compensation expense associated with the restricted stock in 2002. Additionally, this amendment resulted in a new measurement date for this security. In the event that the employee ceases employment with our company prior to the full vesting of this security, additional compensation expense would be recorded. In August 2001, we granted two nonqualified stock options to purchase an aggregate of 0.8 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.20 per share to two other key executive officers. These options were set to expire on January 31, 2002. In December 2001, the executive officers exercised these options (one fully; one partially) by paying cash in the amount of par value and delivering promissory notes for the difference, as permitted pursuant to the terms of the original grant. For accounting purposes, the promissory notes were treated as non-recourse notes. The balance of the promissory notes is recorded as a note receivable and classified in stockholders' equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The notes are due and payable on December 4, 2006 and bear interest at an annual rate of 3.97%, the applicable federal rate for a five-year note in effect during the month of exercise. Interest income recorded under these notes amounted to $0.2 million for each year ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Shares issued upon exercise vest ratably over 36 months and are fully vested at December 31, 2004. Upon the split-off and merger in November 2001 (Note 1), each outstanding IMT stock option (the "IMT Options") was exchanged for an option to purchase shares of our common stock at an exchange ratio of 0.20 and an option to purchase shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock at an exchange ratio of 0.5395. The option split also required that the ratio of intrinsic value to market value for each option be the same. Consequently, the new exercise prices of our options and the Johnson and Johnson options were determined based on the relative fair values of our common stock and the Johnson & Johnson common stock on the first trading day immediately after the split-off and merger, taking into consideration the relative exchange ratios. Accordingly, the total number of shares of common stock underlying stock options that we issued in the split-off was 0.9 million. Concurrent with the option split, (1) the vesting for all our options was accelerated and (2) the period of exercisability for IMT employees who did not become employees of our company was extended. Such actions are deemed to be award modifications pursuant to FIN No. 44. Under FIN No. 44, we measured compensation at the date of the award modifications based on the intrinsic value of the option and recognized (or will recognize in the future) such compensation if, absent the modifications, the award would have been forfeited pursuant to the award's original terms. For IMT employees who did not become employees of our company, the recognition of this charge was immediate and recorded as stock-based compensation in 2001. For IMT employees who became our employees, we have measured this potential charge, a maximum of $1.2 million, at the date of the modification, but will not record any such compensation charge unless and until such time as these employees terminate their employment with us. At such time, the portion of the award that, absent the modification, would have been forfeited under the award's original terms would be recognized as compensation expense. During 2003, we recognized stock-based compensation expense related to certain of the IMT employees who F-51 became our employees in the amount of $2,000, as such employees terminated their employment with us. No such stock-based compensation charge was recognized in 2005 and 2004.

The value of warrants F-53 issued in connection with debt financings has yielded original issue discounts and additional interest expense of $0.2 million for both 2005 and 2004. All outstanding warrants have been classified in equity, pursuant to the provisions of EITF No. 00-19. (e) Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2001, we adopted the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which eligible employees are allowed to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through periodic payroll deductions. Purchases may occur at the end of every six month offering period at a purchase price equal to 85% of the market value of our common stock at either the beginning or end of the offering period, whichever is lower. We may issue up to 0.5 million shares of common stock under this plan. At December 31, 2005, 0.2 million shares had been issued under this plan. (f) Executive Bonus Plan In 2001, we adopted a stockholder approved executive bonus plan (the "Executive Bonus Plan") which was amended in February 2002. Pursuant to the Executive Bonus Plan, as amended, certain of our key executives were entitled to receive, on an annual basis, option grants to be awarded at fair value on date of grants if shares of our common stock attained certain targeted prices per share. Performance determinations were made at the end of each calendar year, starting with December 31, 2002 and ending with December 31, 2005. No performance targets were achieved as of December 31, 2005, the date on which this plan expired. (14) Other Comprehensive Income SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income. In general, comprehensive income combines net income and other changes in equity during the year from non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive income is recorded as a component of stockholders' equity. The following is a summary of the components of and F-54 changes in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2005 and in each of the three years then ended: Cumulative Translation Adjustment (Note 2(b)) Pension Liability Adjustment (Note 8(b)) Other (i) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ii) (in thousands) Balance at December 31, 2002 $ 6,484 $  $  $ 6,484 Period change 5,627 (434 ) 136 5,329 Balance at December 31, 2003 12,111 (434 ) 136 11,813 Period change 5,241 434 33 5,708 Balance at December 31, 2004 17,352  169 17,521 Period change (10,300 )  (169 ) (10,469 ) Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 7,052 $  $  $ 7,052 (i)The $0.2 million included in other comprehensive income, represents unrealized gains on available-for-sales securities. The aggregate fair value of such securities was insignificant and was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These securities were sold during fiscal year 2005. (ii)All of the components of accumulated other comprehensive income relate to our foreign subsidiaries. No adjustments for income taxes were recorded against other comprehensive income as we intend to permanently invest in our foreign subsidiaries in the foreseeable future. (15) Income Taxes Our income tax provision in 2005, 2004 and 2003 mainly represents those recorded by us and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries and by our foreign subsidiaries Unipath Limited in the United Kingdom, Inverness Medical Eurasia in Ireland, Inverness Medical Japan in Japan, and Inverness Medical Switzerland GmbH in Switzerland. (Loss) income before income taxes consists of the following: 2005 2004 2003 (restated) (restated) (in thousands) United States $ (40,582 ) $ (20,102 ) $ (817 ) Foreign 28,192 5,781 $ 12,381 $ (12,390 ) $ (14,321 ) $ 11,564 F-55 Our primary temporary differences that give rise to the deferred tax asset and liability are net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards, nondeductible reserves and accruals and differences in bases of the tangible and intangible assets. The income tax effects of these temporary differences are as follows: December 31, 2005 2004 (restated) (in thousands) Deferred tax assets: NOL and capital loss carryforwards $ 71,926 $ 46,758 Tax credit carryforwards 833 833 Nondeductible reserves 8,721 8,179 Nondeductible accruals 10,199 10,312 Difference between book and tax bases of tangible assets 932 212 Difference between book and tax bases of intangible assets 5,616 19,004 Gross deferred tax asset 98,227 85,298 Less: Valuation allowance (96,721 ) (81,607 ) Total deferred tax assets 1,506 3,691 Deferred tax liabilities: Difference between book and tax bases of tangible assets 2,171 2,382 Difference between book and tax bases of intangible assets 16,710 10,214 Total deferred tax liability 18,881 12,596 Net deferred tax liability $ 17,375 $ 8,905 As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $170.2 million of domestic NOL carryforwards and $26 million of foreign NOL and foreign capital loss carryforwards, which either expire on various dates through 2025 or can be carried forward indefinitely. These loss carryforwards are available to reduce future federal and foreign taxable income, if any. These loss carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the appropriate taxing authorities. Approximately $14.7 million of our foreign NOLs relate to CDIL. As a result of our closure of operations at CDIL, this NOL which is fully reserved at December 31, 2005, may never be realized. The domestic NOL carryforwards include approximately $71.2 million of pre-acquisition losses at IMN, Ischemia, Ostex and ADC. These pre-acquisition losses are subject to the Internal Revenue Service Code Section 382 limitation. Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the use of these losses to an amount equal to the value of the company at the time of the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax exempt rate. The valuation allowance relates to our U.S. NOLs and deferred tax assets and certain other foreign deferred tax assets and is recorded based upon the uncertainty surrounding their realizability, as these assets can only be realized via profitable operations in the respective tax jurisdictions. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, the accounting for the tax benefits of acquired deductible temporary differences and NOL carryforwards, which are not recognized at the acquisition date because a valuation allowance is established and which are recognized subsequent to the acquisitions, will be applied first to reduce to zero any goodwill and other non-current intangible assets related to the acquisitions. Any remaining benefits would be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense. As F-56 of December 31, 2005, $17.1 million of our deferred tax asset pertains to acquired companies, the future benefits of which will be applied first to reduce to zero any goodwill and other non-current intangible assets related to the acquisitions, prior to reducing our income tax expense. Included in the valuation allowance is approximately $2.6 million related to certain NOL carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options, the tax benefit of which, when recognized, will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid-in capital rather than a reduction of income tax. The estimated amount of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries is $41.4 million at December 31, 2005. No amount for U.S. income tax has been provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we consider such earnings to be indefinitely reinvested. In the event of distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to both U.S. income taxes, subject to an adjustment, if any, for foreign tax credits, and foreign withholding taxes payable to certain foreign tax authorities. Determination of the amount of U.S. income tax liability that would be incurred is not practicable because of the complexities associated with this hypothetical calculation, however, unrecognized foreign tax credit carryforwards may be available to reduce some portion of the U.S. tax liability, if any. In accordance with SFAS No. 109 and SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we established reserves for tax contingencies that reflect our best estimate of the transactions and deductions that we may be unable to sustain or that we could be willing to concede as part of a broader tax settlement. We are currently undergoing routine tax examinations by various state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax authorities periodically challenge certain transactions and deductions we reported on our income tax returns. We do not expect the outcome of these examinations, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act") was signed into law. The Act contains a one-time foreign dividend repatriation provision, which provides for a special deduction with respect to certain qualifying dividends from foreign subsidiaries for a limited period. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the Act. We did not repatriate any of our foreign earnings under the foreign dividend repatriation provision of the Act. The Act also provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities, which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010. Under the guidance of FSP No. 109-1, the deduction will be treated as a "special deduction" as described in SFAS No. 109. Therefore, the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date. The impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our tax return. We expect that the effect of the phase in of this new deduction will result in no benefit to our effective tax rate until the U.S. NOL carryforwards are fully utilized.

Our chief operating decision making group is composed of the chief executive officer and members of senior management. Our reportable operating segments are Consumer Diagnostic Products, Vitamins and Nutritional Supplements, Professional Diagnostic Products, and Corporate and Other. Our allocation of certain expenditures benefiting multiple segments has been refined during 2005 and applied on a consistent basis for all period presented below. Included in the operating results of Corporate and Other are non-allocable corporate expenditures and expenses related to our research and development activities in the area of cardiology, the latter of which amounted to $16.8 million, $19.4 million and $12.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. With respect to the cardiology expenditures in 2005, the amount included in Corporate and Other is net of $17.2 million of reimbursements received from ITI Scotland as part of the co-development arrangement that we entered into in February 2005. Total assets in the area of cardiology, which are included in Corporate and Other in the tables below, amounted to $41.2 million at December 31, 2005 and $8.6 million at December 31, 2004. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. We evaluate performance of our operating segments based on revenue and operating income (loss). Revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on where the customer is located. Segment information for 2005, 2004, and 2003 are as follows: 2005 Consumer Diagnostic Products Vitamins and Nutritional Supplements Professional Diagnostic Products Corporate and Other Total (in thousands) Net revenue to external customers $ 166,928 $ 75,411 $ 179,511 $  $ 421,850 Operating income (loss) $ 25,117 $ (7,010 ) $ 2,179 $ (31,059 ) $ (10,773 ) Depreciation and amortization $ 8,464 $ 3,460 $ 13,915 $ 1,917 $ 27,756 Restructuring charge $ 4,797 $  $ 969 $  $ 5,766 Stock-based compensation $  $  $  $ 169 $ 169 Assets $ 253,063 $ 52,967 $ 434,796 $ 50,340 $ 791,166 Expenditures for property, plant and equipment $ 8,020 $ 3,439 $ 6,578 $ 2,196 $ 20,233 2004 Consumer Diagnostic Products Vitamins and Nutritional Supplements Professional Diagnostic Products Corporate and Other Total (restated) (restated) (in thousands) Net revenue to external customers $ 164,211 $ 77,923 $ 131,857 $  $ 373,991 Operating income (loss) $ 29,160 $ (1,003 ) $ 5,840 $ (29,611 ) $ 4,386 Depreciation and amortization $ 9,642 $ 3,686 $ 9,430 $ 742 $ 23,500 Restructuring charge $ 1,725 $  $  $  $ 1,725 Assets $ 243,001 $ 48,072 $ 264,260 $ 12,936 $ 568,269 Expenditures for property, plant and equipment $ 6,779 $ 2,530 $ 6,499 $ 4,581 $ 20,389 F-59 2003 Consumer Diagnostic Products Vitamins and Nutritional Supplements Professional Diagnostic Products Corporate and Other Total (restated) (restated) (in thousands) Net revenue to external customers $ 134,877 $ 71,637 $ 88,644 $  $ 295,158 Operating income (loss) $ 21,785 $ 3,556 $ 9,273 $ (19,780 ) $ 14,834 Depreciation and amortization $ 7,349 $ 3,632 $ 5,288 $ 166 $ 16,435 Stock-based compensation $ 92 $  $ 12 $ 343 $ 447 Assets $ 228,175 $ 52,973 $ 254,349 $ 5,032 $ 540,529 Expenditures for property, plant and equipment $ 5,912 $ 1,496 $ 3,084 $ 643 $ 11,135 2005 2004 2003 (restated) (restated) (in thousands) Revenue by Geographic Area: United States $ 244,719 $ 222,640 $ 188,004 Europe 111,838 100,693 71,099 Other 65,293 50,658 36,055 $ 421,850 $ 373,991 $ 295,158 December 31, 2005 2004 (in thousands) Long-lived Tangible Assets by Geographic Area: United States $ 33,810 $ 29,946 United Kingdom 30,202 27,337 Ireland 1,114 5,897 Other 7,085 3,600 $ 72,211 $ 66,780 (17) Transition Services Agreement with IMT Prior to the split-off from IMT (Note 1), we entered into transition services agreements, whereby we would provide certain transition services to IMT and IMT affiliates for an agreed-upon period of time and service fee. Transition services primarily included management services provided by our U.S. subsidiary, Inverness Medical, Inc. ("IMI") and product packaging services provided by our Irish subsidiary, Cambridge Diagnostics Ireland Ltd. ("CDIL") related to certain diabetes businesses and products. IMI charged approximately $0.2 million during 2003 in transition service fees to IMT, which it believes to approximate arm's-length costs. These fees reduced our general and administrative expenses during 2003. The transition services provided by IMI and CDIL terminated in February 2003 and July 2002, respectively. F-60 (18) Valuation and Qualifying Accounts We have established reserves against accounts receivable for doubtful accounts, product returns, discounts and other allowances. The activity in the table below includes all accounts receivable reserves. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses.

During 2004, we completed a plan of restructuring at our manufacturing operations at Unipath. During 2005, we completed a plan of restructuring at our operations at Ischemia and committed to a restructuring plan for BioStar, which is expected to be completed by the third quarter of fiscal year 2006. The following table sets forth the aggregate restructuring costs and balances recorded in connection with the restructuring activities of the acquired businesses, the 2004 restructuring activities at Unipath and the 2005 restructuring activities at Ischemia and BioStar: Balance at Beginning of Period Costs Included in Purchase Price Amounts Paid Other(i) Balance at End of Period (in thousands) Year ended December 31, 2003 $ 2,272 $ 3,632 $ (2,081 ) $ 129 $ 3,952 Year ended December 31, 2004 $ 3,952 $ 2,034 $ (3,467 ) $ 107 $ 2,626 Year ended December 31, 2005 $ 2,626 $ 2,246 $ (1,858 ) $ (147 ) $ 2,867 (i)Represents foreign currency translation adjustment. F-61 The following describes our restructuring plans for which we had remaining obligations as of December 31, 2005: (a) Recent Restructuring Plans On May 9, 2005, we committed to a plan to cease operations at our facility in Galway, Ireland. During 2005, we recorded a $5.1 million restructuring charge, of which $2.3 million related to severance, early retirement, outplacement services, $2.3 million related to impairment of fixed assets and inventory and $0.5 million related to facility closing costs relating primarily to this plan of termination. The total restructuring charge for the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of $4.1 million charged to cost of goods sold, $0.5 million charged to research and development, $0.3 million charged to general and administrative and $0.2 million charged to other expense. Of this total restructuring charge, $4.8 million and $0.3 million was included in our consumer diagnostic products and professional diagnostic products business segments, respectively. The total number of employees to be involuntarily terminated is 113, of which 98 were terminated during 2005 and the remaining 15 will be terminated during the first quarter of 2006. As of December 31, 2005, of the $2.3 million related to severance, early retirement and outplacement services, $0.6 million remained unpaid. Of the $0.5 million in facility closing cost, $0.4 million remained unpaid as of December 31, 2005. Including the charges recorded during the year, we expect the total restructuring charge primarily related to the closure of CDIL to be approximately $5.2 million, with additional charges relating principally to severance and facility closing costs of $0.1 million expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2006 within the consumer diagnostic products segment. Upon liquidation of CDIL's remaining net assets, which is anticipated to occur during the first quarter of 2006, we expect to record a gain of approximately $3.6 million based on foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2005 as the result of a reclassification of the cumulative translation adjustment to other income, net. In the third quarter of 2004, we completed a plan of restructuring at our operations at Unipath, our manufacturing facility in Bedford, England, to reduce operating expenses and organizational complexities and increase overall accountability at Unipath. As a result, we recorded a $1.7 million restructuring charge in the third quarter of 2004, which is included in cost of sales in the accompanying statements of operations, to cover costs for severance, early retirement and outplacement services. The total number of involuntarily terminated employees was 18, all of whom were terminated as of December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, all restructuring costs have been paid. (b) Restructuring Plans Related to Business Combinations During the fourth quarter of 2005, we established a restructuring plan in connection with our acquisition of Biostar. We recorded a $0.5 million charge of which $0.4 million related to impairment of fixed assets and $0.1 million related to severance costs associated with a headcount reduction. The total number of employees to be involuntarily terminated is 12, of which none were terminated as of December 31, 2005. None of the costs recorded during 2005 were paid as of December 31, 2005. Although we believe our plan and estimated exit costs are reasonable, actual spending for exit activities may differ from current estimated exit costs, which might impact the final aggregate purchase price. In connection with our acquisition of Ischemia in the first quarter of 2005, we established a restructuring plan whereby we have exited the current facilities of Ischemia in Denver, Colorado, and F-62 combined its activities with our existing manufacturing and distribution facilities. Total severance costs associated with involuntarily terminated employees are estimated to be $1.6 million, of which $1.5 million has been paid as of December 31, 2005. We estimated costs to vacate the Ischemia facilities to be approximately $0.1 million, none of which has been paid as of December 31, 2005. We expect to pay the remaining costs during the first quarter of 2006. The total number of involuntarily terminated employees was 17, of which all were terminated as of December 31, 2005. Although we believe our plan and estimated exit costs are reasonable, actual spending for exit activities may differ from current estimated exit costs, which might impact the final aggregate purchase price. As a result of the merger with Ostex (Note 4(c)), we established a restructuring plan whereby we exited the facilities of Ostex in Seattle, Washington, and combined the activities of Ostex with our existing manufacturing and distribution facilities. The total number of employees to be terminated involuntarily under the restructuring plan was 38, of which all were terminated as of December 31, 2005. Total severance costs associated with employees to be terminated involuntarily was $1.6 million, of which substantially all has been paid as of December 31, 2005. Costs to vacate the Ostex facilities were $0.5 million, of which $0.1 million were paid as of December 31, 2005. Additionally, the remaining costs to exit operations, primarily facilities lease commitments, are $1.9 million, of which $1.6 million were paid as of December 31, 2005. Total unpaid exit costs amounted to $0.8 million as of December 31, 2005. Immediately after the close of the acquisition, we reorganized the business operations of IMN to improve efficiencies and eliminate redundant activities on a company-wide basis. The restructuring affected all cost centers within the organization, but most significantly responsibilities at the sales and executive levels, as such activities were combined with our existing business operations. Also as part of the restructuring plan, we relocated one of IMN's warehouses to a closer proximity of the manufacturing facility to improve efficiency. Of the $1.6 million in total exit costs, which include severance costs of involuntarily terminated employees and costs to vacate the warehouse, $0.1 million in restructuring costs remain unpaid as of December 31, 2005. The total number of involuntarily terminated employees was 47, all of which have been terminated as of December 31, 2003. As a result of the acquisition of the Unipath business from Unilever Plc in 2001, we reorganized the operations of the Unipath business for purposes of improving efficiencies and achieving economies of scale on a company-wide basis. Such reorganization affected all major cost centers at the operations in England. Additionally, most business activities of the U.S. division were merged into our existing U.S. businesses. The total number of involuntarily terminated employees was 65, all of which have been terminated as of December 31, 2002. Total exit costs, which primarily related to severance, were initially estimated at $2.3 million. During 2002, the Company finalized all restructuring activities and recorded an additional $1.8 million in exit costs. The additional exit costs were recorded as adjustments to the Unipath business purchase price. As of December 31, 2005, $1.3 million, adjusted for foreign exchange effect, in exit costs remained unpaid. (20) Guarantor Financial Information We issued $150.0 million in Bonds to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S of the Securities Act (Note 6(b)). Our payment obligations under the Bonds are guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries (the "Guarantor Subsidiaries") as of F-63 December 31, 2005. The guarantee is full and unconditional. Separate financial statements of the Guarantor Subsidiaries are not presented because we have determined that they would not be material to investors in the Bonds. The following supplemental financial information sets forth, on a consolidating basis, the statements of operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 and the balance sheets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 for our company (the "Issuer"), the Guarantor Subsidiaries and our other subsidiaries (the "Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries"). The supplemental financial information reflects our investments and the Guarantor Subsidiaries' investments in the Guarantor and Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries using the equity method of accounting. We have extensive transactions and relationships between various members of the consolidated group. These transactions and relationships include inter-company pricing agreements, intellectual property royalty agreements and general and administrative and research and development cost sharing agreements. Because of these relationships, it is possible that the terms of these transactions are not the same as those that would result from transactions among wholly unrelated parties. On October 20, 2004, our subsidiary IMN became a Guarantor Subsidiary under the Bonds. Prior to this change, IMN was a Non-Guarantor Subsidiary. As a result, we have included the financial results of IMN in the results of the Guarantor Subsidiaries in the following supplemental financial information for all periods presented.
