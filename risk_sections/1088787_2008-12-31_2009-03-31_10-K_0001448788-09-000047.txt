ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The risk factors in this section describe the major risks to our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, and should be considered carefully. In addition, these factors constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements (as defined in such act) made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Investors should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts and that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as “will likely result,” ?癮re expected to,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimated,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes” and “projects”) may be forward-looking and may involve estimates and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of such factors. Further, we cannot assess the impact of each such factor on our results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Risks Related To Our Business The metals industry is highly cyclical. Fluctuations in the availability of magnesium and in levels of customer demand have historically been severe, and future changes and/or fluctuations could cause us to experience lower sales volumes and revenues, which would negatively impact our profit margins. The metals industry is highly cyclical. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product, but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions, levels of industry capacity and availability of usable raw materials. The overall levels of demand for our magnesium and magnesium-based products reflect fluctuations in levels of end-user demand, which depend in large part on general macroeconomic conditions worldwide which then impact the level of production in China. For example, many of the principal uses of magnesium and magnesium-related products are for the production of structural metal, steel and aluminum manufacturing, production of alloys used in aircraft and automobile parts, the manufacture of electronic equipment such as computers, cameras, and cell phones and the use of magnesium powder in flares, flashes and pyrotechnics. The market for these products are heavily dependent on general economic conditions, including the availability of affordable energy sources, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and construction demand. These cyclical shifts in our customers’ industries tend to result in significant fluctuations in demand and pricing for our products. As a result, in periods of recession, such as the one we are currently experiencing, or low economic growth, metals companies, including ours, have generally tended to under-perform compared to other industries. We generally have high fixed costs, so changes in industry demand that impact our production volume also can significantly impact our profit margins and our overall financial condition. Economic downturns in the worldwide economy or a prolonged decline in demand in our Magnesium segment has had a negative impact on our operations and a continuation or further deterioration of current economic conditions could have a negative impact on our future financial condition or results of operations. Changes in the prices of magnesium, magnesium-related products, zinc and zinc-related products will have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition. We derive most of our revenue from the sale of magnesium and magnesium-based products. Changes in the market price of magnesium and zinc impact the selling prices of our products, and therefore our profitability is significantly affected by decreased magnesium prices and to a lesser extent by decreased zinc prices. Market prices of magnesium and zinc are dependent upon supply and demand and a variety of factors over which we have little or no control, including: • world economic conditions; • availability and relative pricing of metal substitutes; • labor costs; • energy prices; • environmental laws and regulations; • weather; and • import and export restrictions. - 11 - - Table of Contents Declines in the price of magnesium, and to a lesser extent a decrease in zinc prices, have had a negative impact on our operations commencing in September 2008, and further or future declines could have a negative impact on our future financial condition or results of operations. Market conditions beyond our control determine the prices for our products, and the price for any one or more of our products may fall below our production costs, requiring us to either incur short-term losses, delay completion of construction of our planned zinc mining and production facility and recycling of aluminum wire facility and/or idle or permanently shut down production capacity. Market prices for magnesium may decrease even further, and therefore our operating results may be significantly harmed. If we fail to implement our business strategy, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives is subject to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. For example, factors such as increased competition, legal and regulatory developments, general economic conditions or increased operating costs could prevent us from increasing our capacity, implementing further productivity improvements or continuing to enhance our business and product mix. An important part of our strategy is to grow our business by expanding our capacity to produce magnesium and acquire additional magnesium production facilities and producers. In 2008, we produced, sold and distributed approximately 50,000 metric tons as compared to 45,000 metric tons in 2007. We may need additional financing to implement our acquisition expansion strategy and we may not have access to the funding required for the expansion on acceptable terms. Our construction costs may also increase to levels that would make our facilities unprofitable to operate. Our planned capacity expansions may also suffer significant delays or cost overruns as a result of a variety of factors, such as shortages of workers or materials, transportation constraints, adverse weather, unforeseen difficulties or labor issues, any of which could prevent us from completing our expansion plans as currently expected. Our expansion plans may also result in other unanticipated adverse consequences, such as the diversion of management’s attention from our existing operations. In addition, even if we can implement our strategy, expansion in the magnesium market, increased sales to various industries, including the automobile industry may not materialize to the extent we expect, or at all, resulting in unutilized capacity. Any failure to successfully implement our business strategy, including for any of the above reasons, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may, in addition, decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. Fluctuations in the cost or availability of electricity, coke, coal and/or natural gas would lead to higher manufacturing costs, thereby reducing our margins and limiting our cash flows from operations. Energy is one of our most significant costs. Most of our entities within the Magnesium segment utilize coke gas as energy, only Baotou Changxin Magnesium utilizes coal. Energy prices, particularly for coal and coke gas, have been volatile in recent years and currently exceed historical averages. These fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and contribute to earnings volatility. In 2008 we witnessed rising energy costs. In expectation of the Olympics, electricity was routed to Beijing from nearby Hebei, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia to ensure adequate power supply for the Olympics. In the event of an interruption in the supply of coke gas or coal to our magnesium facilities would require the facility to shut down production. In addition, we do not maintain sources of secondary power at our facilities that only use coke gas, and therefore any prolonged interruptions in the supply of energy to our facilities could result in lengthy production shutdowns, increased costs associated with restarting production and waste of production in progress. We have experienced shortages of coke waste gas in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the plants that produce this gas slowed production due to reduced demand for products they supply to steel smelters. These shortages and any future shortages reduce our production capacity, reducing our net sales and potentially impacting our ability to deliver products to our customers. If we were to lose order volumes from any of our major customers, our sales could decline significantly and our cash flows may be reduced. In 2008, our five largest customers in our Magnesium segment were responsible for 19.2% of our total revenues in this segment. A loss of order volumes from any major customer could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations by lowering sales volumes, increasing costs and lowering profitability. In addition, approximately 35% by volume of our magnesium product shipments in 2008 were to customers who do not have long-term contractual arrangements with us. These customers purchase products from us on a spot basis and may choose not to continue to purchase our products. The loss of these customers or a significant reduction in their purchase orders could have a negative impact on our operations. - 12 - - Table of Contents The value of the equity securities we accept as compensation is subject to adjustment which could result in losses to us in future periods. In our Consulting segment, historically we have accepted equity securities of our clients as compensation for services. These securities are reflected on our balance sheet as “investment in marketable securities held for sale” and “investment in marketable securities held for sale - related party”. At the end of each period, we evaluate the carrying value of the marketable securities for a decrease in value. We evaluate the company underlying these marketable securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is other than temporary. If the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the individual security shall be written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down is charged to earnings. At December 31, 2008 we recognized an impairment of $4,127,555 related to these marketable securities. In the future, should we identify additional impairments, this would adversely affect our operating results for the corresponding periods in that we might be required to reduce the carrying value of these investments. In addition, if we are unable to liquidate these securities, we will be required to write off the investments which would adversely affect our financial position. Our management may be unable to effectively integrate our acquisitions and to manage our growth and we may be unable to fully realize any anticipated benefits of these acquisitions. We are subject to various risks associated with our growth strategy, including the risk that we will be unable to identify and recruit suitable acquisition candidates in the future or to integrate and manage the acquired companies. We face particular challenges in that our acquisition strategy is based on companies located in and operating within China. Acquired companies’ histories, the geographical location, business models and business cultures will be different from ours in many respects. Even if we are successful in identifying and closing acquisitions of companies, our directors and executive management will face significant challenges in their efforts to integrate the business of the acquired companies or assets and to effectively manage our continued growth. Any future acquisitions will be subject to a number of challenges, including: • the diversion of management time and resources and the potential disruption of our ongoing business; • difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; • unexpected costs and time associated with upgrading both the internal accounting systems as well as educating each of their staff as to the proper methods of collecting and recording financial data; • potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses; • the difficulty of retaining key alliances on attractive terms with partners and suppliers; and • the difficulty of retaining and recruiting key personnel and maintaining employee morale. There can be no assurance that our efforts to integrate the operations of any acquired assets or companies will be successful, that we can manage our growth or that the anticipated benefits of these proposed acquisitions will be fully realized. We may need additional financing to fund acquisitions and our operations which we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms. Additional capital raising efforts in future periods may be dilutive to our then current shareholders or result in increased interest expense in future periods. We may need to raise additional working capital to continue to make acquisitions and fund our operations. In an effort to augment growth and expand business opportunities, since 2006 we have provided approximately $8.9 million in working capital to our subsidiaries. Our future capital requirements depend, however, on a number of factors, including our operations, the financial condition of an acquisition target and its need for capital, our ability to grow revenues from other sources, our ability to manage the growth of our business and our ability to control our expenses. During 2009, we plan to use our magnesium holdings as a basis for raising capital and expansion of our magnesium holdings. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of debt, this will result in increased interest expense. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our company held by existing shareholders will be reduced and those shareholders may experience significant dilution. As we will generally not be required to obtain the consent of our shareholders before entering into acquisition transactions, shareholders are dependent upon the judgment of our management in determining the number of, and characteristics of, stock issued as consideration in an acquisition. In addition, new securities may contain certain rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of our common stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the working capital as needed in the future on terms acceptable to us, if at all, as the current capital markets have been adversely affected by the severe liquidity crisis. If we do not raise capital as needed, we will be unable to fully implement our acquisition expansion strategy. - 13 - - Table of Contents We are dependent on certain key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success is, to a certain extent, attributable to the management, sales and marketing, and operational expertise of key personnel of our subsidiaries in China who perform key functions in the operation of our business as well as our U.S. based management team. We do not exercise any substantive day to day supervision over the activities of key members of our China based management team which includes Messrs. Jingdong Chen, Chen Chi, and Xiaowen Zhuang. The loss of one or more of these key employees or our senior management, including Dr. Wang, our Chief Executive Officer or Yuwei Huang, our Executive Vice President - Magnesium, could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal and financial controls in the PRC. PRC companies have in some cases, been resistant to the adoption of Western styles of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, which include sufficient corporate governance, cash management and other internal controls and, computer, financial and other control systems. In addition, we may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in the PRC. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulties in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet western standards with our subsidiaries and our future acquisitions. Therefore, we may, in turn, experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls. Any such deficiencies, weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock. Our management has determined that as of December 31, 2008, we did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework as a result of identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to cash management and related party transactions. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. For a detailed description of these material weaknesses and our remediation efforts and plans, see “Part II — Item 9A (T) — Controls and Procedures.” If the result of our remediation of the identified material weaknesses is not successful, or if additional material weaknesses are identified in our internal control over financial reporting, our management will be unable to report favorably as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and/or our disclosure controls and procedures, and we could be required to further implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and potentially lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation. Certain agreements to which we are a party and which are material to our operations lack various legal protections which are customarily contained in similar contracts prepared in the United States. Our subsidiaries include companies organized under the laws of the PRC and all of their business and operations are conducted in China. We are a party to certain contracts related to our operations in China. While these contracts contain the basic business terms of the agreements between the parties, these contracts do not contain certain clauses which are customarily contained in similar contracts prepared in the U.S., such as representations and warranties of the parties, confidentiality and non-compete clauses, provisions outlining events of defaults, and termination and jurisdictional clauses. Because our contracts in China omit these customary clauses, notwithstanding the differences in Chinese and U.S. laws, we may not have the same legal protections as we would if the contracts contained these additional clauses. We anticipate that our Chinese subsidiaries will likely enter into contracts in the future which will likewise omit these customary legal protections. While we have not been subject to any adverse consequences as a result of the omission of these customary clauses, and we consider the contracts to which we are a party to contain all the material terms of our business arrangements with the other party, future events may occur which lead to a dispute which could have been avoided if the contracts included customary clauses in conformity with U.S. standards. Contractual disputes which may arise from this lack of legal protection could divert management’s time from the operation of our business, require us to expend funds attempting to settle a possible dispute, limit the time our management would otherwise devote to the operation of our business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. - 14 - - Table of Contents Intercompany loans may be subject to PRC regulations. We currently have several inter-company loans between our PRC subsidiaries and we may continue to enter into inter-company financing arrangements to meet our internal capital needs. PRC laws generally do not permit companies that do not possess a financial service business license to extend loans directly to other companies, including affiliates, without proceeding through a financial agency. The enforcement of these restrictions remains unpredictable, and government authorities may declare these loans void, require the forfeiture of any interest paid and levy fines or other penalties upon the parties involved, among other remedies. From time to time we engage in related party transactions. There are no assurances that these transactions are fair to our company. From time to time our subsidiaries enter into transactions with related parties which include purchases from or sales to a related party, advancing related parties significant sums as prepayments for future goods or services and working capital and the payment of fees for consulting services, among other transactions. We are in the process of adopting policies and procedures which will require the pre-approval of loans between related parties and have adopted a related person transaction policy that requires the pre-approval or ratification transactions between the company or one or more of our subsidiaries and any related person in amounts and under terms to be established by the board of directors upon completion of a study to determine amounts that are appropriate given the relationship we have with the related party. Notwithstanding these policies, we cannot assure you that in every instance the terms of the transactions with related parties are on terms as fair as we might receive from or extend to third parties. Yuwei Huang, our Executive Vice President – Magnesium, an officer of several of our magnesium subsidiaries and a director is also an owner and executive officer of several companies which directly compete with our magnesium business Mr. Yuwei Huang who serves as our Executive Vice President – Magnesium, an executive officer of several of our Magnesium segment subsidiaries and a director of our company is also an owner and the Chairman of a competitor of ours, YiWei Magnesium. YiWei Magnesium, a minority owner of two of our Magnesium segment subsidiaries, owns interests in several other magnesium factories, a magnesium alloy factory and a magnesium powder desulphurization reagent factory, all located in China. Due to Mr. Huang’s interest in our competitors and his position as an officer and director of our company, he is subject to certain inherent conflicts of interest and there can be no assurances that our business and operations will not be adversely impacted as a result of these conflicts. Failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in the PRC. We can make no assurance, however, that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Investment Company Act of 1940 will limit the value of securities we can accept as payment for our business consulting services which may limit our future revenues. We have historically accepted securities as payment for our services and will likely continue to do so in the future, but only to the extent that it does not cause us to become classified as an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940. To the extent that we are required to reduce the amount of securities we accept as payment for our consulting services to avoid becoming an investment company, our future revenues from our business consulting services may substantially decline if our clients cannot pay our fees in cash. A reduction in the amount of our consulting fees will materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. Any future change in our fee structure for our consulting services could also severely limit our ability to attract business consulting clients in the future. - 15 - - Table of Contents The acquisition of new businesses is costly and such acquisitions may not enhance our financial condition. A significant element of our growth strategy is to acquire controlling interests in companies that operate in China and that offer services, products, technologies, industry specializations or geographic coverage that extend or complement our existing business. The process to undertake a potential acquisition is time-consuming and costly. We expect to expend significant resources to undertake business, financial and legal due diligence on our potential acquisition targets and there is no guarantee that we will acquire the company after completing due diligence. The process of identifying and consummating an acquisition could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash and exposure to undisclosed or potential liabilities of acquired companies. In addition, even if we are successful in acquiring additional companies, there are no assurances that the operations of these businesses will enhance our future financial condition. To the extent that a business we acquire does not meet the performance criteria used to establish a purchase price, some or all of the goodwill related to that acquisition could be charged against our future earnings, if any. The operations of our basic materials segment will be subject to risks and hazards inherent in the mining industry. Our Basic Materials segment, if and when mining operations commence, will be engaged in the mining and processing of zinc. These operations will be subject to risks and hazards inherent in the mining industry, including, but not limited to, ground fall, flooding, environmental hazards and the discharge of toxic chemicals, explosions and other accidents, unanticipated variations in grade and other geological problems, water conditions, surface or underground conditions, metallurgical and other processing problems, mechanical equipment performance problems, the lack of availability of materials and equipment, the occurrence of accidents, labor force disruptions, force majeure factors, unanticipated transportation costs, and weather conditions. Any of these risks could result in work stoppages, delays in production, the development of properties, production commencement dates and production quantities, increased production costs and rates, damage to or destruction of mines and other production facilities, injury or loss of life, damage to property, environmental damage, and possible legal liability for such damages. As of the date of this report, we have not established a reserve on this property. Presently we do not have a timetable for when our operations will commence. Substantially all of our assets and operations are located in the PRC and are subject to changes resulting from the political and economic policies of the Chinese government. Our business operations could be restricted by the political environment in the PRC. The PRC has operated as a socialist state since 1949 and is controlled by the Communist Party of China. In recent years, however, the government has introduced reforms aimed at creating a socialist market economy and policies have been implemented to allow business enterprises greater autonomy in their operations. Changes in the political leadership of the PRC may have a significant effect on laws and policies related to the current economic reform programs, other policies affecting business and the general political, economic and social environment in the PRC, including the introduction of measures to control inflation, changes in the rate or method of taxation, the imposition of additional restrictions on currency conversion and remittances abroad, and foreign investment. Moreover, economic reforms and growth in the PRC have been more successful in certain provinces than in others, and the continuation or increases of such disparities could affect the political or social stability of the PRC. Although we believe that the economic reform and the macroeconomic measures adopted by the Chinese government have had a positive effect on the economic development of China, the future direction of these economic reforms is uncertain and the uncertainty may decrease the attractiveness of our company as an investment, which may in turn result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock. We cannot assure you that the current Chinese policies of economic reform will continue. Because of this uncertainty, there are significant economic risks associated with doing business in China. Although the majority of productive assets in China are owned by the Chinese government, in the past several years the government has implemented economic reform measures that emphasize decentralization and encourages private economic activity. In keeping with these economic reform policies, the PRC has been openly promoting business development in order to bring more business into the PRC. Because these economic reform measures may be inconsistent or ineffective, there are no assurances that: • the Chinese government will continue its pursuit of economic reform policies; • the economic policies, even if pursued, will be successful; • economic policies will not be significantly altered from time to time; or • business operations in China will not become subject to the risk of nationalization. - 16 - - Table of Contents We cannot assure you that we will be able to capitalize on these economic reforms, assuming the reforms continue. Because our business model is dependent upon the continued economic reform and growth in China, any change in Chinese government policy could materially adversely affect our ability to continue to implement our business model. China’s economy has experienced significant growth in the past decade, but such growth has been uneven across geographic and economic sectors and has recently been slowing. Even if the Chinese government continues its policies of economic reform, there are no assurances that economic growth in that country will continue or that we will be able to take advantage of these opportunities in a fashion that will provide financial benefit to us. The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which our Chinese subsidiaries must conduct our business activities. The PRC only recently has permitted provincial and local economic autonomy and private economic activities. The government of the PRC has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in the PRC or particular regions of the PRC, and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in our Chinese subsidiaries. Any recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, or another widespread public health problem, could interrupt our operations A renewed outbreak of SARS or another widespread public health problem in China could have a negative effect on our operations. Our operations may be impacted by a number of health-related factors, including the following: • quarantines or closures of some of our offices which would severely disrupt our operations; • the sickness or death of our key management and employees; or • a general slowdown in the Chinese economy. An occurrence of any of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences of public health problems could result in a loss of revenues in future periods and could impact our ability to conduct the operations of our Chinese subsidiaries as they are presently conducted. If we were unable to continue the operations of our Chinese subsidiaries as they are now conducted, our revenues in future periods would decline and our ability to continue as a going concern could be in jeopardy. If we were unable to continue as a going concern, you could lose your entire investment in our company. Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our revenues effectively. We may not have ready access to cash on deposit in banks in the PRC. Because a substantial portion of our revenues are in the form of Renminbi (RMB), the main currency used in China, any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use revenue generated in RMB to fund any future business activities outside China or to make dividend or other payments in U.S. Dollars. Although the Chinese government introduced regulations in 1996 to allow greater convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain, including primarily the restriction that foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell or remit foreign currencies, after providing valid commercial documents, at those banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business. In addition, conversion of RMB for capital account items, including direct investment and loans, is subject to government approval in China, and companies are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account items. At December 31, 2008 our PRC subsidiaries had approximately $7.6 million on deposit in banks in China, which represented approximately 53% of our cash. We cannot be certain that we could have ready access to that cash should we wish to transfer it to bank accounts outside the PRC nor can we be certain that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the RMB, especially with respect to foreign exchange transactions. - 17 - - Table of Contents We may be unable to enforce our rights due to policies regarding the regulation of foreign investments in China. The PRC’s legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes in which decided legal cases have little value as precedent, unlike the common law system prevalent in the United States. The PRC does not have a well-developed, consolidated body of laws governing foreign investment enterprises. As a result, the administration of laws and regulations by government agencies may be subject to considerable discretion and variation, and may be subject to influence by external forces unrelated to the legal merits of a particular matter. China’s regulations and policies with respect to foreign investments are evolving. Definitive regulations and policies with respect to such matters as the permissible percentage of foreign investment and permissible rates of equity returns have not yet been published. Statements regarding these evolving policies have been conflicting and any such policies, as administered, are likely to be subject to broad interpretation and discretion and to be modified, perhaps on a case-by-case basis. The uncertainties regarding such regulations and policies present risks which may affect our ability to achieve our stated business objectives. If we are unable to enforce any legal rights we may have under our contracts or otherwise, our ability to compete with other companies in our industry could be limited which could result in a loss of revenue in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The market price for shares of our common stock has declined substantially in recent months and may continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. The market for common stock has recently been subject to significant disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of these securities, which may or may not have corresponded to the business or financial success of the particular company. The market price for shares of our common stock has declined substantially in recent months and could decline further if our future operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of market analysts and investors and/or current economic or market conditions persist or worsen. Some specific factors that may have a significant effect on the future market price of our shares of common stock include: • actual or expected fluctuations in our operating results; • variance in our financial performance from the expectations of market analysts; • changes in general economic conditions or conditions in our industry generally; • changes in conditions in the financial markets; • announcements of significant acquisitions or contracts by us or our competitors; • our inability to raise additional capital; • changes in applicable laws or regulations, court rulings and enforcement and legal actions; • additions or departures of key management personnel; • actions by our stockholders; • changes in market prices for our products or for our raw materials; and • changes in stock market analyst research and recommendations regarding the shares of our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally. In addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq and the market for companies with China based operations in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of these and other factors, you may be unable to resell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid for such shares. Future sales of common stock by some of our existing stockholders and stock options could cause our stock price to decline. As of the date of this report, our Chief Executive Officer, former President and former Chief Operating Officer in the aggregate beneficially own approximately 39.1% of our outstanding common stock. Sales of such shares in the open market, as well as shares we may issue upon the exercise of outstanding options, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. The perception among investors that these sales may occur could produce the same effect. - 18 - - Table of Contents ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. Not applicable to a smaller reporting company.
