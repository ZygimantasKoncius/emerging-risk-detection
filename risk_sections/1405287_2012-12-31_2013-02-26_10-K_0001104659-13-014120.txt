ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business is subject to numerous risks. The risk factors listed below include any material changes to and supersede the description of the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011. The risk factors that appear below, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, communications with investors and oral statements. Such forward-looking statements are discussed under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Risks Related to Our Business We have a history of losses and there can be no assurance that we will become or remain profitable or that losses will not continue to occur. We had a net loss of $12.9 million and $23.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. We may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future. Our ability to achieve profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to: · attract and retain an adequate client base; · effectively manage a large global business; · react to changes, including technological changes, in the markets we target or operate in; · deploy our services in additional markets or industry segments; · maintain operating efficiencies in our service centers across the globe; · respond to competitive developments and challenges; · attract and retain experienced and talented personnel; and · establish strategic business relationships. We may not be able to do any of these successfully, and our failure to do so would likely have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. 8 Table of Contents Recent changes in U.S. and global economic conditions or a decline in end user acceptance of our clients products could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our business. Our business is directly affected by the performance of our clients and general economic conditions. Recent turmoil in the financial markets has adversely affected economic activity in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business. In substantially all of our client programs, we generate revenue based, in large part, on the amount of time our employees devote to our clients customers. Consequently, the amount of revenue generated from many client programs is dependent upon consumers interest in and use of our clients products and/or services, which may be adversely affected by general economic conditions. Our clients may not be able to market or develop products and services that require their customers to use our services, especially as a result of the downturn in the U.S. and worldwide economy. In addition, increased use of self-help services or other new technologies could cause a decline in customer demand for the services that we provide. Furthermore, a decline in our clients business or performance, including possible client bankruptcies, could impair their ability to pay for our services. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected if any of our major clients were unable or unwilling, for any reason, to pay for our services. Our business may be impacted by the performance of our clients. Our revenue and call volume is generally highly correlated with products sold, services purchased or renewed by our clients customers or end users, and revenue of our clients. Our clients may experience rapid changes in their prospects, substantial price competition and pressure on their results of operations, which may result in lower volumes and/or pressure on us to lower our prices. In the event that some of our service centers do not receive sufficient call volume in the future, we may be required to close them and relocate business to other centers. This would require substantial employee severance, lease termination costs and other re-structuring costs. Moreover, we are exposed to additional risks related to our clients ability to pay and the collectability of our accounts receivables. In the event that our clients prospects deteriorate or the availability of credit tightens, our clients liquidity may be adversely impacted, resulting in delayed or reduced payments to us. Such delays or reductions in payment or the non-payment by our clients of amounts owed to us may require us to incur a bad debt expense. In the event that one of our major clients should file for bankruptcy protection or otherwise fail, our future business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. A substantial portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of clients, and the loss of one or more of these clients would materially reduce our revenue and cash flow and adversely affect our business. We have derived, and we believe that we will continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of clients. Although we generally enter into multi-year contracts with clients, many of which are renewable, these contracts generally do not require clients to provide a minimum amount of revenues and allow clients to terminate earlier for convenience. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain, renew or extend our contracts with our major clients. There can also be no assurance that if we were to lose one or more of our major clients, we would be able to replace such clients with new clients that generate a comparable amount of revenues. A number of factors could cause us to lose business or revenue from a client, and some of these factors are not predictable and are beyond our control. For example, a client may demand price reductions, change its outsourcing strategy, move work in-house or reduce previously forecasted demand due to circumstances wholly unrelated to our service levels. In addition, the volume of work we perform for specific clients may vary from year to year. Thus, a major client in one year may not provide the same level of revenue in any subsequent year. In many cases, if a client terminates its contract with us or does not meet its forecasted demand, we would have no contractual recourse even if we have built-out facilities and/or hired and trained service professionals to provide services to the client. Consequently, the loss of one or more of our major clients, or the inability to generate anticipated revenues from them, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our revenue is highly dependent on a few industries and any decrease in demand for outsourced business processes in these industries could reduce our revenue and seriously harm our business. Most of our revenue is derived from clients concentrated in the computing/hardware and telecommunications service providers industries. The success of our business largely depends on continued demand for our services from clients in these industries, as well as on trends in these industries to outsource business processes on a global basis. Other developments may also lead to a decline in the demand for our services in the industries we serve. Consolidation in any of the industries that we serve, particularly involving our clients, may decrease the potential number of buyers of our services. Furthermore, many of our existing and new clients have begun or plan to consolidate or reduce the number of 9 Table of Contents service providers that they use for various services in various geographies. To the extent that we are not successful in becoming the recipient of the consolidation of services by these clients, our business and revenues will suffer. Any significant reduction in, or the elimination of, the use of the services we provide within any of these industries would reduce our revenue and cause our profitability to decline. We may not be able to achieve incremental revenue growth or profitability. Our strategy calls for us to achieve incremental revenue growth and profitability through initiatives, such as opening new sites or expanding our existing international service locations. Other initiatives we may pursue include (i) the addition or expansion of services, such as sales and warranty services; (ii) the introduction of front-end technology-driven service solutions for fee-based services, self-help, and other technology driven solutions; and (iii) operational improvements in areas such as employee attrition, site capacity utilization, centralization of certain administrative services, productivity rates and greater use of technology to drive efficiencies and cost savings. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties or delays in implementing these initiatives, and any such difficulties or delays would adversely affect our future operating results and financial performance. We may be unable to successfully execute on any of our identified business opportunities or other business opportunities that we determine to pursue. In order to pursue business opportunities, we will need to continue to build our infrastructure, our client initiatives and operational capabilities. Our ability to do any of these successfully could be affected by one or more of the following factors: · the ability of our technology and hardware, suppliers and service providers to perform as we expect; · our ability to execute our strategy and continue to operate a large, more diverse business efficiently on a global basis; · our ability to effectively manage our third party relationships; · our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; · our ability to effectively manage our employee costs and other expenses; · our ability to retain and grow our clients and the current portfolio of business with each client; · technology and application failures and outages, interruptions of service, security breaches or fraud which could adversely affect our reputation and our relations with our clients; · our ability to accurately predict and respond to the rapid technological changes in our industry and the evolving service and pricing demands of the markets we serve; and · our ability to raise additional capital to fund our growth. Our failure to adequately address the above factors would have a significant impact on our ability to implement our business plan and our ability to pursue other opportunities that arise, which might negatively affect our business. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition due to challenges associated with integrating LBM into our operations. The success of the Acquisition will depend in part on the success of our management in integrating the operations, technologies and personnel of LBM in the future. Our inability to successfully integrate the operations of LBM or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, including potential synergies or sales or growth opportunities, could adversely affect our ability to pursue and execute our strategies related to LBM, which would impair our growth and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the integration will require substantial attention from our management, which could further harm our results of operations. We may engage in future acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and harm our financial position and operating results. In addition to the Acquisition, we may pursue acquisitions of companies or assets in order to enhance our market position and/or expand the types of services that we offer to our clients, and we may enter geographic markets where we do not currently conduct business. We may also acquire minority interest in companies or enter into joint venture arrangements with other parties, which may include existing clients. We may also pursue certain acquisitions which may cause management distractions and increased legal costs. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and 10 Table of Contents we may not be able to consummate such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we cannot be sure that they will ultimately strengthen our competitive position, or that our clients, employees or investors will not view them negatively. Future acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations, divert management from day-to-day responsibilities, increase our indebtedness, liabilities, expenses and exposure to different legal regimes and/or regulations and harm our operating results or financial condition. We may not be able to successfully integrate these acquisitions into our operations, may lose key clients, employees and members of management and may not achieve the synergies and other benefits expected from the acquisition or investment. Future acquisitions may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses and could result in an increase in amortization expense, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If we acquire or invest in other businesses, products or technologies, we may be unable to integrate them with our business, our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions. We have in the past and may in the future acquire or invest in additional companies, products or technologies that we believe are strategic. On February 25, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding share capital of LBM. In the future, we may not be able to identify, negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully. Even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business, product or technology, such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks, including: · the acquired company or assets may not further our business strategy, or we may over pay for the company or assets, or the economic conditions underlying our acquisition decision may change; · difficulty integrating the operations, systems and personnel of the acquired business, or retaining the key personnel of the acquired business; · difficulty retaining key clients, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business; · our ongoing business and managements attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically or culturally diverse enterprises; · entry into markets in which we have limited experience and where competitors hold stronger market positions; · inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses; · incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results; · potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or product, including but not limited to, issues with the acquired companys intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, data back-up and security (including security from cyber-attacks), privacy practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, employee, customer or partner issues or legal and financial contingencies; · exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition; · potential inability to certify that internal controls over financial reporting are effective; and · potential incompatibility of business cultures. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time. From time to time, we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated. Such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time, as well as out-of-pocket costs. The consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results. If we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition or require additional debt or equity contributed from our Sponsors. To the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock, including options or other rights, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, large one-time write-offs, such as of acquired in-process research and development costs, and restructuring charges. If we fail to manage future growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately. We plan to expand our business. We anticipate that this expansion will require substantial management effort and significant additional investment in infrastructure, service offerings and service center expansion. In addition, we will be 11 Table of Contents required to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting procedures. Our future growth will place a significant strain on managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. If we are unable to manage growth successfully, our business will be harmed. Our business depends on uninterrupted service to our clients. A system failure or labor shortage could cause delays or interruptions of service, which could cause us to lose clients. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our service centers, computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems against damage or interruption from fire, power loss, telecommunications interruption or failure, natural disaster, breaches in data and technology security integrity and other similar events in order to provide our clients with reliable services. Additionally, we depend on our employees to perform our services on behalf of our clients. If we are unable to staff our service centers due to labor shortages, or if employees miss work due to labor strikes or civil or political unrest, outbreak of disease or pandemic, floods, natural disasters and other similar events, our ability to provide our clients with reliable services will be hindered. Some of the events that could adversely affect our ability to deliver reliable service include physical damage to our network operations centers; disruptions, power surges or outages to our computer and telecommunications technologies which are beyond our control; sabotage or terrorist attacks and cyber attacks or data theft; software defects; fire or natural disasters such as typhoons, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes; outbreak of disease or pandemic; civil unrest and political turmoil; and labor shortages or walk-outs. Technology is a critical foundation to our service delivery. We utilize and deploy internally developed and third party software solutions that are often customized by us across various hardware and software environments. We operate an extensive internal voice and data network that links our global sites together in a multi-hub model that enables the rerouting of call volumes. We also rely on multiple public communication channels for connectivity to our clients. Maintenance of and investment in these foundational components are critical to our success. If the reliability of technology or network operations fall below required service levels, or a systemic fault affects the organization broadly, business from our existing and potential clients may be jeopardized and cause our revenue to decrease. We are in the process of consolidating our United States data centers in order to improve reliability and to generate cost savings, a project that we expect to complete in the first half of 2013. If we experience a temporary or permanent interruption at one or more of our service centers and/or data centers, through casualty, operating malfunction (whether caused by us, one of our vendors or otherwise), labor shortage or otherwise, our business could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to pay contractual damages to affected clients or allow some clients to terminate or renegotiate their contracts with us. Although we maintain property, business interruption and general liability insurance, including coverage for errors and omissions, there can be no assurance that our existing coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The occurrence of errors could result in a loss of data to us or our clients, which could cause a loss of revenues, failure to achieve product acceptance, increased insurance costs, legal claims against us, delays in payment to us by clients, increased service and warranty expenses or financial concessions, diversion of resources, injury to our reputation, or damages to our efforts to build brand awareness, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our market share and, in turn, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If we are unable to keep pace with technological changes, our business will be harmed. Our business is highly dependent on our computer and telecommunications equipment, infrastructure and software capabilities. Our failure to maintain the competitiveness of our technological capabilities or to respond effectively to technological changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our continued growth and future profitability will be highly dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to: · expand our existing solutions offerings; · achieve cost efficiencies in our existing service center operations; · introduce new solutions that leverage and respond to changing technological developments; and · remain current with technology advances. There can be no assurance that technologies, applications or services developed by our competitors or vendors will not render our products or services non-competitive or obsolete, that we can successfully develop and market any new services or products, that any such new services or products will be commercially successful or that the integration of automated customer support capabilities will achieve intended cost reductions. In addition, the inability of equipment vendors and service providers to supply equipment and services on a timely basis could harm our operations and financial condition. 12 Table of Contents We are subject to U.S. and foreign jurisdiction laws relating to individually identifiable information, and failure to comply with those laws, whether or not inadvertent, could subject us to legal actions and negatively impact our operations. We process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals, both in our role as a service provider and as an employer. As a result, we are subject to numerous U.S. (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the European Union Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, governing the protection and processing of individually identifiable information, including social security numbers, and financial and health information. Failure to comply with these types of laws may subject us to, among other things, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data could expose us to protracted and costly litigation and penalties and may cause us to lose clients. We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations and with our partners and clients. Security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. We are also required at times to manage, utilize, record and store sensitive or confidential data. As a result, we are subject to laws and regulations designed to protect this information. Many jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislation relating to the protection of sensitive personal data or other consumer protections that may impact our internal processes and require us to enact new data protection and security measures. If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution. Unauthorized disclosure or recording of sensitive or confidential employee, client or customer data, whether through system failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and employees. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees or third parties, could result in negative publicity, legal liability and damage to our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We may be unable to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified personnel, which could materially increase our costs. Our business is dependent on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key executives and also recruit, hire, train and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel, including individuals with significant experience in the industries that we have targeted. The CRM and BPO service industry is labor intensive and is normally characterized by high monthly employee turnover. Any increase in our employee turnover rate would increase our recruiting and training costs, decrease our operating effectiveness and productivity and delay or deter us from taking on additional business resulting in lower financial performance. Also, the introduction of significant new clients or the implementation of new large-scale programs may require us to recruit, hire and train personnel at an accelerated rate. In addition, some of our facilities are located in geographic areas with relatively low unemployment rates, potentially making it more difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to hire, train and retain sufficient qualified personnel to adequately staff our business. We are dependent upon our experienced senior management and key employees who would be difficult to replace. The success of our business is dependent upon the active participation of our senior management and key employees who have extensive experience and important business relationships within our industry. Our experienced senior management team has developed our business strategies. The loss of service of one or more members of our senior management team or key employees or the inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel for any reason may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could impede our ability to meet our clients needs, damage our reputation, and make it difficult to execute our growth strategy. We have, on a consolidated basis, a substantial amount of debt that could impact our ability to obtain future financing or pursue our growth strategy. We have substantial indebtedness. We and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement, as amended by the First Amendment to Credit Agreement dated June 3, 2011, Second Amendment to Credit Agreement dated November 1, 2011, and Third Amendment to Credit Agreement dated December 27, 2012 (the Credit Agreement), with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC, as agent and co-arranger, and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, as co-arranger, and each of the lenders party thereto, as lenders, providing for a revolving credit financing (the ABL Credit Facility) of up to $125 million, including a $20 million sub-limit for letters of credit. As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $264.8 13 Table of Contents million of indebtedness (including capital leases) and up to an additional $74.3 million of borrowings available under the ABL Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base limitations and other specified terms and conditions. We also have outstanding $200 million aggregate principal amount of 11.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2014 (the Notes). Our high level of indebtedness could have important consequences and significant adverse effects on our business, including the following: · we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, which will reduce the funds available to us for operations and other purposes; · our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired; · we could be placed at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have proportionately less debt; · our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited; and · we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. The instruments governing our ABL Credit Facility and the Notes contain, and the instruments governing any indebtedness we may incur in the future may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests and require us to comply with certain financial covenants. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing, or that any such financing would be on terms acceptable to us. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the covenants under our debt agreements, and any failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of our outstanding indebtedness and, potentially, a cross-default under certain other material agreements to which we are a party. Payments on our indebtedness require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to meet our cash requirements and service our debt is impacted by many factors that are outside of our control. We have outstanding $200 million aggregate principal amount of 11.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2014. The Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of October 1, 2009, among us, certain of our subsidiaries (the Note Guarantors), and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee (the Indenture). We expect to obtain the funds to pay our expenses and to pay the amounts due under the Notes primarily from our operations and borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility. Our ability to meet our expenses and make these payments thus depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future and our currently anticipated growth in revenue and cash flow may not be realized, either or both of which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness, including the Notes, or to fund other liquidity needs. Our ability to borrow amounts under our ABL Credit Facility is subject to borrowing base limitations and other specified terms and conditions, and the ability of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to borrow amounts under our ABL Credit Facility in the future is also subject, among other conditions, to our provision of security interests in certain assets of those foreign subsidiaries which we did not provide upon the closing of the ABL Credit Facility and we may not be able to provide in the future. If we do not have sufficient cash resources in the future, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt, sell assets or borrow more money. We might not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to achieve any of these alternatives could materially adversely affect the value of the Notes and our ability to pay the amounts due under the Notes. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness that could further exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture governing the Notes and the loan agreement governing our ABL Credit Facility contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions that permit us to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness. If we incur additional debt, the risks described above under We have, on a consolidated basis, a substantial amount of debt, which could impact our ability to obtain future financing or pursue our growth strategy and Payments on our indebtedness require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to meet our cash requirements and service our debt is impacted by many factors that are outside of our control could intensify. 14 Table of Contents We may not be able to predict our future tax liabilities. If we become subject to increased levels of taxation or if tax contingencies are resolved adversely, our results of operations and financial performance could be adversely affected. Due to the international nature of our operations, we are subject to the complex and varying tax laws and rules of several foreign jurisdictions. We may not be able to predict the amount of future tax liabilities to which we may become subject due to some of these complexities if our positions are challenged by local tax authorities. Any increase in the amount of taxation incurred as a result of challenges to our tax filing positions or due to legislative or regulatory changes could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to tax audits, including issues related to transfer pricing, in the United States and other jurisdictions. We have material tax-related contingent liabilities that are difficult to predict or quantify. While we believe that our current tax provisions are reasonable and appropriate, we cannot be assured that these items will be settled for the amounts accrued or that additional exposures will not be identified in the future or that additional tax reserves will not be provided for any such exposures. Our financial results may be impacted by significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. A substantial amount of our operating costs is incurred in foreign currencies. In many cases, we bill our clients in U.S. Dollar, Canadian Dollar and Euro denominated amounts and incur costs in the servicing country in local currency. If the value of the U.S. Dollar drops relative to other currencies, our cost of providing services outside the United States will increase accordingly when translated to U.S. Dollars. We also receive a portion of revenue denominated in foreign currencies, especially the Euro. If the U.S. Dollar increases in value relative to other currencies, the value of those revenues will decrease accordingly when measured in U.S. Dollars. In addition, substantially all of our employees based outside the United States are paid in local currency, while our revenues are collected in other currencies (primarily in U.S. Dollars and Euros). As a result, our employee costs as a percentage of revenues may increase or decrease significantly if the exchange rates between these currencies fluctuate significantly. Any continued significant fluctuations in the currency exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar, Canadian Dollar and Euro and the currencies of countries in which we operate may affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. A substantial portion of our costs are incurred and paid in Philippine Pesos. Therefore, we are exposed to the risk of an increase in the value of the Philippine Peso relative to the U.S. Dollar, which would increase the value of those expenses when measured in U.S. Dollars. Although we engage in hedging related to the Canadian Dollar, the Indian Rupee and the Philippine Peso, our hedging strategy, including our ability to acquire the desired amount of hedge contracts, may not sufficiently protect us from further strengthening of these currencies against the U.S. Dollar. As a result, our expenses when measured in U.S. Dollars could increase and harm our operating results. On the other hand, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against the Canadian Dollar, the Indian Rupee or the Philippine Peso, our hedging strategy could reduce the potential benefits we would otherwise expect from a strengthening U.S. Dollar. We are also doing business in Latin America but do not yet hedge currencies from these countries as there are no markets available in these currencies where hedge contracts may be acquired. Our international operations and sales subject us to additional risks, including risks associated with unexpected events. We conduct business in various countries outside of the United States, including Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden, France, Germany, Poland, Denmark, Bulgaria, India, the Philippines, China, El Salvador, Egypt, Tunisia, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic and Honduras. A key component of our growth strategy is our entry into new markets or expansion of our existing markets, as we did in China in 2011 and in the Philippines and Honduras in 2012 and 2013. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully market, sell and deliver our services in these markets, or that we will be able to successfully expand our international operations. The global reach of our business could cause us to be subject to unexpected, uncontrollable and rapidly changing events and circumstances. The following factors, among others, could adversely affect our business and earnings: · failure to properly comply with foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign activities including employment law and data protection requirements; · compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulations in the countries where we operate now and in the future, including employment laws, intellectual property requirements, data privacy laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws; · difficulties in managing foreign operations and attracting and retaining appropriate levels of senior management and staffing; · longer cash collection cycles; · seasonal reductions in business activities, particularly throughout Europe; 15 Table of Contents · compliance with local tax laws which can be complex and may result in unintended adverse tax consequences; · anti-American sentiment due to U.S. government policies that may be unpopular in certain countries; · difficulties in enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems; · fluctuations in exchange rates that may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. Dollars of services we provide in foreign markets, where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency and revenues are earned in U.S. Dollars or other currency; · changes in general economic conditions or political strife or upheaval in countries where we operate; · the ability to efficiently repatriate cash to the United States and transfer cash between foreign jurisdictions; · changes in transfer pricing policies for income tax purposes in countries where we operate; · restrictions on downsizing operations and personnel in Europe and other jurisdictions (i.e. regulatory or works council restrictions) and expenses and delays associated with any such activities; and · changes to or elimination of the international tax holiday for our subsidiaries in the Philippines. As we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our global operations and reduce our global sales, adversely affecting our business and future financial performance. Certain countries where we do business have recently experienced political and economic instability and civil unrest and terrorism, or could be subject to natural disasters or disease outbreak, which have disrupted and may continue to disrupt our operations and may cause our business to suffer. Certain countries where we do business, particularly Egypt and Tunisia, and less recently the Philippines, India, and certain Latin American countries, have experienced or are experiencing civil unrest, terrorism and political turmoil, resulting in temporary work stoppages and telecommunication or other technology outages. If such civil unrest or political turmoil increases or such operational disruptions become prolonged, our existing and potential new clients may hesitate to keep or move their business into such locations. Moreover, countries where we do business (in particular the Philippines), have experienced significant inflation, currency declines and shortages of foreign exchange. We are exposed to the risk of cost increases due to inflation in the Philippines, which has historically been at a much higher rate than in the United States. In addition, we do business in various European nations, such as Italy and Spain, that have recently experienced an economic slowdown that was brought on by high sovereign government debt loads. Increased economic instability in these countries could disrupt our operations and cause our business to suffer. We have a large number of employees across the globe in many different countries that are subject to various natural disasters, such as typhoons and related floods in the Philippines. In addition, many of the countries in which we operate have different levels of healthcare monitoring. A natural disaster such as a typhoon or flood, or a significant or widespread outbreak of a pandemic, such as the flu or other contagious illness, could cause significant disruptions to our employee base and could adversely impact our business and our results of operations. Our business may not develop in ways that we currently anticipate due to negative public reaction to outsourcing and proposed legislation. We have based our growth strategy on certain assumptions regarding our industry, services and future demand in the market for our services. However, the trend to outsource business processes may not continue and could reverse. Outsourcing is a politically sensitive topic in the United States and elsewhere due to a perceived association between outsourcing providers and the loss of jobs in the home country. Current or prospective clients may elect to perform such services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring these services from domestic to off-shore providers to avoid negative perceptions that may be associated with using an off-shore provider. In the United States, a variety of federal and state legislation has been proposed that, if enacted, could restrict or discourage U.S. companies from outsourcing services outside the United States. Because many of our clients are companies headquartered in the United States, any expansion of existing laws or the enactment of new legislation restricting offshore outsourcing could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. It is possible that legislation could be adopted that would restrict U.S. private sector companies that have federal or state government contracts from outsourcing their services to off-shore service providers. This would also negatively affect our ability to attract or retain clients that have these contracts. Current or prospective clients may elect to perform such services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring their services from onshore to off-shore providers. A slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends towards off-shore outsourcing could adversely affect our future operating results and financial performance. 16 Table of Contents Our financial results may be adversely affected by increases in labor-related costs. Because a significant portion of our operating costs relate to labor costs, an increase in U.S. or foreign wages, costs of employee benefits or taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, over the past several years, healthcare insurance costs have increased at a rate much greater than that of general cost or price indices. In addition, we may face increased costs due to new legislation in certain jurisdictions, such as implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the United States. Increases in our pricing may not fully compensate us for increases in labor and other costs incurred in providing services. We may also need to increase the levels of employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to remain competitive in attracting and retaining the quality and number of employees that our business requires. Wage costs in India, the Philippines and other off-shore locations have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in North America and Europe for comparably skilled professionals. However, because of rapid economic growth in India and the Philippines, increased demand for CRM and BPO services, and increased competition for skilled employees in offshore low cost locations, wages for comparably skilled employees in such locations are increasing at a faster rate than in North America and Europe. As a result, the cost benefit enjoyed by our clients may be reduced, thereby reducing the volumes they offer to us with an adverse effect on our future revenue. We expect competition for skilled employees at the service professional and middle and upper management levels to continue to increase, which would affect the availability and the cost of our employees, increase our attrition rate and, without a change in our pricing, reduce our gross margins. Some of our facilities are located in jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, where it is difficult or expensive to temporarily or permanently lay off workers due to both local laws and practices within these jurisdictions. Such laws will make it more expensive for us to respond to adverse economic conditions. Although we have not experienced significant union activity or organized labor activity in the past, there can be no assurance that we will not experience such activity in the future. Union organization could increase our cost of labor, limit our ability to modify work schedules and cause work stoppage. Our profitability will be adversely affected if we do not maintain sufficient capacity utilization. Our profitability is influenced significantly by the capacity utilization of our service centers. Because a majority of our business consists of inbound contacts from end-users, we have no control of when or how many end user customer contacts are made. Moreover, we have significantly higher utilization during peak (week day) periods than during off-peak (night and weekend) periods and therefore we need to reserve capacity at our service centers to anticipate peak periods. We may consolidate or close under-performing service centers in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins. If we close service centers in the future due to insufficient customer demand, we may be required to record restructuring or impairment charges, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal service center capacity utilization. Current tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate will expire over the coming years. We currently benefit from income tax holiday incentives for certain projects and operations in foreign jurisdictions, such as incentives in the Philippines pursuant to registrations with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority, or PEZA. These tax holiday incentives generally expire over a period of years. The income tax holiday of our various PEZA-registered projects in the Philippines expire at staggered dates starting in 2013. In the event we are not able to renew, the expiration of these tax holidays will increase our effective income tax rate. Our revenues and costs are subject to quarterly variations that may adversely affect quarterly financial results. We have experienced, and in the future could experience, quarterly variations in revenues as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control, including: · the timing of new client contracts; · the timing of new service offerings or modifications in client strategies; · our ability to attract and retain and increase sales to existing customers; · the timing of acquisitions of businesses and products by us and our competitors; · our ability to effectively build and start-up new solution centers; 17 Table of Contents · product and price competition; · our ability to build an integrated service offering on a common technology platform; · changes in our operating expenses; · software defects or other product quality problems; · the ability to implement new technologies on a timely basis; · the expiration or termination of existing contracts; · the timing of increased expenses incurred to obtain and support new business; · currency fluctuations; and · changes in our revenue mix among our various service offerings. In addition, our planned staffing levels, investments and other operating expenditures are based on revenue forecasts provided by our clients. If actual revenues are below these forecasts or our own expectations in any given quarter, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would likely be adversely affected for that quarter and thereafter. In addition, to the extent that we enter into mergers and acquisitions or new business ventures in the future, our quarterly or future results may be impacted. Many of our existing or emerging competitors are better established and have significantly greater resources than us, which may make it difficult to attract and retain clients and grow revenues. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and fragmented. We expect competition to persist and intensify in the future. Our competitors include large independent firms, as well as small firms offering specific applications, divisions of large entities, and the in-house operations of clients or potential clients. Because we compete with the in-house operations of existing and potential clients, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if our existing clients decide to internally service CRM and other business processes that currently are outsourced or if potential clients retain or increase their in-house customer service and product support capabilities. In addition, competitive pressures from current or future competitors or in-house operations could cause our services to lose market acceptance or result in significant price erosion, which would have an adverse effect upon our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Some of our clients may seek to consolidate services that we provide, which may in turn reduce the amount of work we perform for them. Some of our existing and future competitors have greater financial, human and other resources, longer operating histories, greater technological expertise, more recognizable brand names and more established relationships than we do in the industries that we currently serve or may serve in the future. Some of our competitors may enter into merger, strategic or commercial relationships among themselves or with larger, more established companies in order to increase their ability to address client needs. Increased competition, pricing pressure or loss of market share could reduce our operating margin, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We have a long selling cycle for our CRM and BPO services that requires significant funds and management resources and a long implementation cycle that requires significant resource commitments. We have a long selling cycle for our CRM and BPO services for new clients, which requires significant investment of capital, resources and time by both our clients and us. Typically, before committing to use our services, potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them as to the value of our services and assessing the feasibility of integrating our systems and processes with theirs. Our clients then evaluate our services before deciding whether to use them. Therefore, our selling cycle, which generally ranges from six to twelve months, is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control, including our clients decision to choose alternatives to our services (such as other providers or in-house offshore resources), changes in client management and the timing of our clients budget cycles and approval processes. In addition, we may not be able to successfully conclude a contract after the selling cycle is complete. Implementing our services involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our clients and us. Our clients may also experience delays in obtaining internal approvals or delays associated with technology or system implementations, thereby delaying further the implementation process. Our clients and future clients may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services, and we may fail to close sales with potential clients to which we have devoted significant time and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 18 Table of Contents Once we are engaged by a client, it may take us several months before we start to recognize significant revenues. When we are engaged by a client after the selling process for our CRM and BPO services, it takes several weeks to integrate the clients systems with ours and may take several months thereafter to fully ramp up our services and staff levels, including hiring and training qualified service professionals and technicians, to the clients requirements. While some client contracts require that the client reimburse us for up-front costs such as training and equipment, we may incur significant costs during the implementation stage of the engagement which we will not recover until we start to recognize revenues under the contract. Implementing processes can be subject to potential delays similar to certain of those affecting the selling cycle. As a result, we may not recognize revenues that exceed the amount of our initial expense outlay, or at all, for a prolonged period after being engaged. If we are unable to adjust our pricing terms or the mix of products and services we provide to meet the changing demands of our CRM and BPO clients and potential CRM and BPO clients, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Industry pricing models are evolving, and we anticipate that clients may increasingly request transaction-based pricing. This pricing model will place additional pressure on the efficiency of our service delivery so that we can maintain desired operating margins. If we are unable to adapt our operations to evolving pricing models, our results of operations may be adversely affected or we may not be able to offer pricing that is attractive relative to our competitors. In addition, the CRM and BPO services we provide to our clients, and the revenues and income from those services, may decline or vary as the type and quantity of services we provide under those contracts change over time, including as a result of a shift in the mix of products and services we provide. Furthermore, our clients, some of which have experienced rapid changes in their prospects, substantial price competition and pressures on their profitability, have in the past and may in the future demand price reductions, automate some or all of their processes or change their outsourcing strategy by moving more work in-house or to other providers, any of which could reduce our profitability. Any significant reduction in or the elimination of the use of the services we provide to any of our clients, and any requirement to lower our prices, would harm our business. We depend on third-party technology that, if it should become unavailable, contain defects, or infringe on another partys intellectual property rights, could result in increased costs or delays in the production and improvement of our products or result in liability claims. We license critical third-party technology that we incorporate into our services on a non-exclusive basis. We customize the third-party software in many cases to our specific needs and content requirements. While we monitor our usage of third-party technology and our compliance with our licenses to use such technology, we may inadvertently violate the terms of our license agreements, which could subject us to liability, including the termination of our rights to use such software or the imposition of additional license fees. If our relations with any of these third-party technology providers become impaired, or if the cost of licensing any of these third-party technologies increases, our gross margin levels could significantly decrease and our business could be harmed. The operation of our business would also be impaired if errors occur in the third-party software that we utilize or the third-party software infringes upon another partys intellectual property rights. It may be more difficult for us to correct any defects or viruses in third-party software because the software is not within our control. If we are unable to correct such errors, our business could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to invest the appropriate resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the capabilities of their software. In addition, although we try to limit our exposure to potential claims and liabilities arising from third-party infringement claims arising out of, and errors, defects or viruses in, such third-party software in the license agreements that we enter into with such third-party software providers, such provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims in all cases and in all jurisdictions. Software defects or errors could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Design defects or software errors may delay software introductions or reduce the satisfaction level of clients and may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our software is highly complex and may, from time to time, contain design defects or software errors that may be difficult to detect and/or correct. Since both our clients and we use our software to perform critical business functions, design defects, software errors or other potential problems within or outside of our control may arise from the use of our software. These design defects or errors may also result in financial or other damages to our clients, for which we may be held responsible. Although our agreements with clients often contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims and liabilities, these provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims in all cases and in all jurisdictions. Claims and liabilities arising from client losses could result in monetary damages to us and could cause damage to our reputation, adversely affecting our business and results of operations. 19 Table of Contents Failure to comply with internal control attestation requirements could lead to loss of public confidence in our financial statements. Any future acquisitions and other material changes in our operations likely will require us to expand and possibly revise our disclosure controls and procedures, internal controls over our financial reporting and related corporate governance policies. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and associated regulations relating to effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting are subject to varying interpretations due to their lack of specificity and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations differ from the conduct intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities or varying interpretations of such laws and regulations, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions, our clients and the public may lose confidence in our internal controls and the reliability of our financial statements, and our reputation may be harmed. The industries in which we operate are continually evolving. Our services may become obsolete, and we may not be able to develop competitive services on a timely basis or at all. The CRM and BPO service industry is characterized by rapid technological change, competitive pricing, frequent new service introductions and evolving industry standards. Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these challenges and to offer competitive services on a timely basis. We will face a number of difficulties and uncertainties associated with this reliance on technological development, such as: · competition from service providers using other means to deliver similar or alternative services; · realizing economies of scale on a global basis; · responding successfully to advances in competing technologies and network security in a timely and cost-effective manner; and · existing, proposed or yet-to-be developed technologies that may render our services less profitable or obsolete. Government regulation of our industry and the industries we serve may increase our costs and restrict the operation and growth of our business. Both the U.S. Federal and various state governments regulate our business and the outsourced business services industry as a whole. The Federal Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act of 1994 broadly authorizes the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue regulations restricting certain telemarketing practices and prohibiting misrepresentations in telephone sales. Our operations outside the United States are also subject to regulation. In addition to current laws, rules and regulations that regulate our business, bills are frequently introduced in Congress to regulate the use of credit information. We cannot predict whether additional legislation that regulates our business will be enacted. Additional legislation could limit our activities or increase our cost of doing business, which could cause our operating results to suffer. We could be subject to a variety of regulatory enforcement or private actions for our failure or the failure of our clients to comply with these regulations. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if the effect of government regulation of the industries we serve is to reduce the demand for our services or expose us to potential liability. We may not be able to maintain control of our business in China. The government of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) restricts foreign investment in telecommunications businesses. Accordingly, we operate our business in China through a variable interest entity in China (the VIE) owned by two individuals designated by us who are PRC citizens. We have no equity ownership interest in the VIE and rely on contractual arrangements with the VIE and its stockholders to control and operate the VIE. These contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing control over the VIE as direct ownership and we cannot ensure that we will be able to enforce these contracts. For example, the VIE could fail to take actions required for, or beneficial to, our business or fail to maintain its license despite its contractual obligations to do so. In addition, we cannot ensure that the shareholders of the VIE will always act in our best interests. If the VIE or its stockholders fail to perform their obligations under their respective agreements with us, we may need to engage in litigation in China to enforce our rights, which may be time-consuming and costly, divert management resources, or have other adverse effects on our business, and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights. The laws and regulations governing our business in the PRC and the enforcement and performance of our contractual arrangements with the VIE and its stockholders are relatively new and may be subject to change and their official interpretation and enforcement may involve substantial uncertainty. New laws and regulations that affect our business may 20 Table of Contents also be applied retroactively. We cannot ensure that the PRC government would agree that the operating arrangements comply with PRC licensing, registration, or other regulatory requirements, with existing policies, or with requirements or policies that may be adopted in the future. If the PRC government determines that we do not comply with applicable law, it could revoke our business and operating licenses, require us to discontinue or restrict our operations, restrict our right to collect revenue, require us to restructure our operations, impose additional conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply, impose restrictions on our business operations or on our clients, or take other regulatory or enforcement actions against us that could be harmful to our business. We may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us. From time to time we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including patent, software, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable, there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
