risk factors and viability of its various business lines and segments and, depending upon the results of these evaluations and analyses, may conclude to exit certain segments and/or business lines. Further, in conjunction with these ongoing evaluations and analyses, the Company may decide to sell, merge or close certain branch facilities. Lending Activities General. The loan portfolio of the Company is comprised of commercial, commercial and residential real estate and consumer loans. Such loans are primarily originated within the Companys market areas of East and Middle Tennessee and are generally secured by residential or commercial real estate or business or personal property located in the counties of Greene, Washington, Hamblen, Sullivan, Hawkins, Blount, Knox, McMinn, Loudon, Monroe, Cocke, Sumner, Rutherford, Davidson, Lawrence and Montgomery Counties, Tennessee. 3 Loan Composition. The following table sets forth the composition of the Companys loans at December 31 for each of the periods indicated. 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Commercial $ 245,285 $ 165,975 $ 134,823 $ 93,836 $ 96,122 Commercial real estate 729,254 484,088 445,104 342,407 295,002 Residential real estate 319,797 319,713 295,528 233,128 210,489 Loans held-for-sale 2,686 1,151 3,546 6,646 7,945 Consumer 90,682 82,532 81,624 77,644 80,314 Other 3,476 4,989 6,134 14,938 13,779 Unearned interest (9,852 ) (10,430 ) (10,988 ) (11,696 ) (13,159 ) Loans, net of unearned interest $ 1,381,328 $ 1,048,018 $ 955,771 $ 756,903 $ 690,492 Allowance for loan losses $ (19,739 ) $ (15,721 ) $ (14,564 ) $ (12,586 ) $ (11,221 ) Loan Maturities. The following table reflects at December 31, 2005 the dollar amount of loans maturing based on their contractual terms to maturity. Demand loans, loans having no stated schedule of repayments and loans having no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less. Due in One Due After One Year Due After Year or Less Through Five Years Five Years Total Commercial $ 137,299 $ 97,131 $ 10,855 $ 245,285 Commercial real estate 300,439 385,951 42,864 729,254 Residential real estate 46,410 107,054 162,514 315,978 Loans held for sale 2,686   2,686 Consumer 25,111 54,613 4,925 84,649 Other 2,604 681 191 3,476 Total $ 514,549 $ 645,430 $ 221,349 $ 1,381,328 The following table sets forth the dollar amount of the loans maturing subsequent to the year ending December 31, 2006 distinguished between those with predetermined interest rates and those with floating, or variable, interest rates. Fixed Rate Variable Rate Total Commercial $ 51,253 $ 56,733 $ 107,986 Commercial real estate 288,624 140,190 428,814 Residential real estate 144,828 124,740 269,568 Consumer 58,642 897 59,539 Other 731 141 872 Total $ 544,078 $ 322,701 $ 866,779 Commercial Loans. Commercial loans are made for a variety of business purposes, including working capital, inventory and equipment and capital expansion. At December 31, 2005, commercial loans outstanding totaled $245,285, or 18.01%, of the Companys net loan portfolio. Such loans are usually amortized over one to seven years and generally mature within five years. Commercial loan applications must be supported by current financial information on the borrower and, where appropriate, by adequate collateral. Commercial loans are generally underwritten by addressing cash flow (debt service coverage), primary and secondary sources of repayment, financial strength of any guarantor, liquidity, leverage, management experience, ownership structure, economic conditions and industry-specific trends and collateral. The loan to value ratio depends on the type of collateral. Generally speaking, accounts receivable are financed between 70% and 80% of accounts receivable less than 90 days past due. If other collateral is taken to support the loan, the loan to value of accounts receivable may approach 85%. Inventory financing will range between 50% and 60% depending on the borrower and nature of inventory. The Company requires a first lien position for such loans. These types of loans are generally considered to be a higher credit risk than other loans originated by the Company. 4 Commercial Real Estate Loans. The Company originates commercial loans, generally to existing business customers, secured by real estate located in the Companys market area. At December 31, 2005, commercial real estate loans totaled $729,254, or 53.56%, of the Companys net loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans are generally underwritten by addressing cash flow (debt service coverage), primary and secondary source of repayment, financial strength of any guarantor, strength of the tenant (if any), liquidity, leverage, management experience, ownership structure, economic conditions and industry specific trends and collateral. Generally, the Company will loan up to 80-85% of the value of improved property, 65% of the value of raw land and 75% of the value of land to be acquired and developed. A first lien on the property and assignment of lease is required if the collateral is rental property, with second lien positions considered on a case-by-case basis. Residential Real Estate. The Company also originates one-to-four family, owner-occupied residential mortgage loans secured by property located in the Companys primary market area. The majority of the Companys residential mortgage loans consists of loans secured by owner-occupied, single-family residences. At December 31, 2005, the Company had $319,797, or 23.49%, of its net loan portfolio in residential real estate loans. Residential real estate loans generally have a loan-to-value ratio of 85% or less. These loans are underwritten by giving consideration to the ability to pay, stability of employment or source of income, credit history and loan-to-value ratio. Home equity loans make up approximately 27% of residential real estate loans. Home equity loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios when the borrowers repayment capacity and credit history conform to underwriting standards. Superior Financial extends sub-prime mortgages to borrowers who generally have a higher risk of default than mortgages extended by the Bank. Sub-prime mortgages totaled $10,980, or 3.43%, of the Companys residential real estate loans at December 31, 2005. The Company sells most of its one-to-four family mortgage loans in the secondary market to Freddie Mac and other mortgage investors through the Banks mortgage banking operation. Sales of such loans to Freddie Mac and other mortgage investors totaled $39,788 and $49,892 during 2005 and 2004, respectively, and the related mortgage servicing rights were sold together with the loans. Consumer Loans. At December 31, 2005, the Companys consumer loan portfolio totaled $90,682, or 6.66%, of the Companys total net loan portfolio. The Companys consumer loan portfolio is composed of secured and unsecured loans originated by the Bank, Superior Financial and GCB Acceptance. The consumer loans of the Bank have a higher risk of default than other loans originated by the Bank. Further, consumer loans originated by Superior Financial and GCB Acceptance, which are finance companies rather than banks, generally have a greater risk of default than such loans originated by commercial banks and, accordingly, carry a higher interest rate. Superior Financial and GCB Acceptance consumer loans totaled approximately $30,011, or 33.10%, of the Companys installment consumer loans at December 31, 2005. The performance of consumer loans will be affected by the local and regional economy as well as the rates of personal bankruptcies, job loss, divorce and other individual-specific characteristics. Past Due, Special Mention, Classified and Nonaccrual Loans. The Company classifies its problem loans into three categories: past due loans, special mention loans and classified loans (both accruing and non-accruing interest). When management determines that a loan is no longer performing and that collection of interest appears doubtful, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status. All loans that are 90 days past due are considered nonaccrual unless they are adequately secured and there is reasonable assurance of full collection of principal and interest. Management closely monitors all loans that are contractually 90 days past due, treated as special mention or otherwise classified or on nonaccrual status. Nonaccrual loans that are 120 days past due without assurance of repayment are charged off against the allowance for loan losses. 5 The following table sets forth information with respect to the Companys nonperforming assets at the dates indicated. At these dates, the Company did not have any troubled debt restructurings. At December, 31 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis $ 5,915 $ 6,242 $ 4,305 $ 7,475 $ 5,857 Accruing loans which are contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments 809 664 224 307 871 Total nonperforming loans 6,724 6,906 4,529 7,782 6,728 Real estate owned: Foreclosures 2,920 1,353 3,599 4,805 2,589 Other real estate held and repossessed assets 823 213 627 767 623 Total nonperforming assets $ 10,467 $ 8,472 $ 8,755 $ 13,354 $ 9,940 The Companys continuing efforts to resolve nonperforming loans occasionally include foreclosures, which result in the Companys ownership of the real estate underlying the mortgage. If nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2005 had been current according to their original terms and had been outstanding throughout 2005, or since origination if originated during the year, interest income on these loans would have been approximately $368. Interest actually recognized on these loans during 2005 was not significant. Foreclosed real estate increased $1,567, or 115.8%, to $2,920 at December 31, 2005 from $1,353 at December 31, 2004. The real estate consists of 29 properties, of which seven are commercial properties with a carrying value of $1,932, 19 are single family residential properties with a carrying value of $883, one is a multi-family home with a carrying value of $25 and two are vacant lots with a carrying value of $80. Management expects to liquidate these properties during 2006. Management has recorded these properties at fair value less estimated selling cost and the subsequent sale of such properties is not expected to result in any adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, subject to business and marketing conditions at the time of sale. Other repossessed assets increased $610, or 286.38%, to $823 at December 31, 2005 from $213 at December 31, 2004. The increase is due primarily to the repossession and pending liquidation of foreclosed rental equipment of $240 and $225 of stock not traded on a public market. Total impaired loans increased by $2,469, or 20.22%, from $12,210 at December 31, 2004 to $14,679 at December 31, 2005. This increase is primarily reflective of additional impaired loans in the Bank resulting from several commercial relationships placed on nonaccrual status and in the process of litigation or foreclosure action. At December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately $8,764 in loans that are not currently classified as nonaccrual or 90 days past due or otherwise restructured but which known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms. Such loans were considered classified by the Company and were composed primarily of various commercial, commercial real estate and consumer loans. The Company believes that these loans are adequately secured and management does not expect any material loss. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which management believes is adequate to absorb all probable losses on loans then present in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is affected by: (1) loan charge-offs, which decrease the allowance; (2) recoveries on loans previously charged-off, which increase the allowance; and (3) the provision of possible loan losses charged to income, which increases the allowance. In determining the provision for possible loan losses, it is necessary for management to monitor fluctuations in the allowance resulting from actual charge-offs and recoveries, and to periodically review the size and composition of the loan portfolio in light of current and anticipated economic conditions in an effort to evaluate portfolio risks. If actual losses exceed the amount of the allowance for loan losses, earnings of the Company could be adversely affected. The amount of the provision is based on managements judgment of those risks. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Companys provision for loan losses increased by $529, or 9.06%, to $6,365 from $5,836 for the year ended December 31, 2004, while the allowance for loan losses increased by $4,018, or 25.56%, to $19,739 at 6 December 31, 2005 from $15,721 at December 31, 2004. The increase in the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses is attributable to the organic loan growth the company experienced in 2005. Also, the allowance for loan losses was increased by $1,467 in 2005 by the allowance acquired in the Clarksville transaction. The following is a summary of activity in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Balance at beginning of year $ 15,721 $ 14,564 $ 12,586 $ 11,221 $ 11,728 Reserve acquired in acquisition 1,467 363 1,340   Subtotal 17,188 14,927 13,926 11,221 11,728 Charge-offs: Commercial (1,500 ) (1,538 ) (1,007 ) (1,216 ) (411 ) Commercial real estate (189 ) (1,044 ) (664 ) (956 ) (997 ) Subtotal (1,689 ) (2,582 ) (1,671 ) (2,172 ) (1,408 ) Residential real estate (622 ) (424 ) (745 ) (740 ) (669 ) Consumer (3,250 ) (3,962 ) (4,381 ) (4,736 ) (5,753 ) Other (22 ) (12 )    Total charge-offs (5,583 ) (6,980 ) (6,797 ) (7,648 ) (7,830 ) Recoveries: Commercial 160 304 195 239 11 Commercial real estate 180 66 92 54 54 Subtotal 340 370 287 293 65 Residential real estate 166 63 92 141 102 Consumer 1,246 1,504 1,281 1,514 1,197 Other 17 1    Total recoveries 1,769 1,938 1,660 1,948 1,364 Net charge-offs (3,814 ) (5,042 ) (5,137 ) (5,700 ) (6,466 ) Provision for loan losses 6,365 5,836 5,775 7,065 5,959 Balance at end of year $ 19,739 $ 15,721 $ 14,564 $ 12,586 $ 11,221 Ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding, net of unearned inome, during the period 0.32 % 0.51 % 0.64 % 0.80 % 0.94 % Ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans 293.56 % 227.64 % 321.57 % 161.73 % 166.78 % Ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans, net of unearned income 1.43 % 1.50 % 1.53 % 1.68 % 1.64 % 7 Breakdown of allowance for loan losses by category.

Regulation, Supervision and Governmental Policy The following is a brief summary of certain statutes, rules and regulations affecting the Company and the Bank. A number of other statutes and regulations have an impact on their operations. The following summary of applicable statutes and regulations does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations. 11 Bank Holding Company Regulation. The Company is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act (the Holding Company Act) and, as such, is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the FRB. Acquisitions and Mergers. Under the Holding Company Act, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the FRB before (1) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the bank holding company would directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of such shares; (2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (3) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. Also, any company must obtain approval of the FRB prior to acquiring control of the Company or the Bank. For purposes of the Holding Company Act, control is defined as ownership of more than 25% of any class of voting securities of the Company or the Bank, the ability to control the election of a majority of the directors, or the exercise of a controlling influence over management or policies of the Company or the Bank. The Change in Bank Control Act and the related regulations of the FRB require any person or persons acting in concert (except for companies required to make application under the Holding Company Act), to file a written notice with the FRB before such person or persons may acquire control of the Company or the Bank. The Change in Bank Control Act defines control as the power, directly or indirectly, to vote 25% or more of any voting securities or to direct the management or policies of a bank holding company or an insured bank. Bank holding companies like the Company are currently prohibited from engaging in activities other than banking and activities so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The FRBs regulations contain a list of permissible nonbanking activities that are closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks. A bank holding company must file an application or notice with the FRB prior to acquiring more than 5% of the voting shares of a company engaged in such activities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the GLB Act), however, greatly broadened the scope of activities permissible for bank holding companies. The GLB Act permits bank holding companies, upon election and classification as financial holding companies, to engage in a broad variety of activities financial in nature. The Company has not filed an election with the FRB to be a financial holding company, but may chose to do so in the future. Capital Requirements. The Company is also subject to FRB guidelines that require bank holding companies to maintain specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. See Capital Requirements. Dividends. The FRB has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The FRB has issued a policy statement expressing its view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the companys net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the companys capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. The Company does not believe compliance with this policy statement will limit the Companys ability to maintain its dividend payment rate. Support of Banking Subsidiaries. Under FRB policy, the Company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its banking subsidiaries and, where required, to commit resources to support each of such subsidiaries. Further, if the Banks capital levels were to fall below minimum regulatory guidelines, the Bank would need to develop a capital plan to increase its capital levels and the Company would be required to guarantee the Banks compliance with the capital plan in order for such plan to be accepted by the federal regulatory authority. Under the cross guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the FDI Act), any FDIC-insured subsidiary of the Company such as the Bank could be liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in connection with (i) the default of any other FDIC-insured subsidiary also controlled by the Company or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to any FDIC-insured subsidiary of the Company in danger of default. Transactions with Affiliates. The Federal Reserve Act, as recently amended by Regulation W, imposes legal restrictions on the quality and amount of credit that a bank holding company or its non-bank subsidiaries (affiliates) may obtain from bank subsidiaries of the holding company. For instance, these restrictions generally require that any such extensions of credit by a bank to its affiliates be on nonpreferential terms and be 12 secured by designated amounts of specified collateral. Further, a banks ability to lend to its affiliates is limited to 10% per affiliate (20% in the aggregate to all affiliates) of the banks capital and surplus. Bank Regulation. As a Tennessee banking institution, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions. Tennessee and federal banking laws and regulations control, among other things, required reserves, investments, loans, mergers and consolidations, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, and establishment of branches and other aspects of the Banks operations. Supervision, regulation and examination of the Company and the Bank by the bank regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather than for holders of the Common Stock of the Company. Extensions of Credit. Under joint regulations of the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, banks must adopt and maintain written policies that establish appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate. These policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards, prudent underwriting standards, including loan-to-value limits that are clear and measurable, loan administration procedures and documentation, approval and reporting requirements. A banks real estate lending policy must reflect consideration of the Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies (the Interagency Guidelines) that have been adopted by the federal banking regulators. The Interagency Guidelines, among other things, call upon depository institutions to establish internal loan-to-value limits for real estate loans that are not in excess of the loan-to-value limits specified in the Guidelines for the various types of real estate loans. The Interagency Guidelines state that it may be appropriate in individual cases to originate or purchase loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value limits. The aggregate amount of loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value limits, however, should not exceed 100% of total capital, and the total of such loans secured by commercial, agricultural, multifamily and other non-one-to-four family residential properties should not exceed 30% of total capital. Federal Deposit Insurance. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent provided by law, and the Bank is subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system for insured depository institutions that takes into account the risks attributable to different categories and concentrations of assets and liabilities. In early 2006, Congress passed the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005, which made certain changes to the Federal deposit insurance program. These changes included merging the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund, increasing retirement account coverage to $250,000 and providing for inflationary adjustments to general coverage beginning in 2010, providing the FDIC with authority to set the funds reserve ratio within a specified range, and requiring dividends to banks if the reserve ratio exceeds certain levels. The new statute grants banks an assessment credit based on their share of the assessment base on December 31, 1996, and the amount of the credit can be used to reduce assessments in any year subject to certain limitations. The Company does not anticipate this new assessment system will have a material affect on its operating results or financial condition. Safety and Soundness Standards. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) required the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation, non-capital safety and soundness standards for all insured depository institutions and depository institution holding companies. The FDIC and the other federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards pursuant to FDICIA. The safety and soundness guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, and compensation, fees and benefits. Among other things, the guidelines require banks to maintain appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage risks and exposures identified in the guidelines. Capital Requirements. The FRB has established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by registered bank holding companies, and the FDIC has established similar guidelines for state-chartered banks, such as the Bank, that are not members of the FRB. The regulations of the FRB and FDIC impose two sets of capital adequacy requirements: minimum leverage rules, which require the maintenance of a specified minimum ratio of capital to total assets, and risk-based capital rules, which require the maintenance of specified minimum ratios of capital to risk-weighted assets. At December 31, 2005, the Company and the Bank satisfied the minimum required regulatory capital requirements. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 13 The FDIC has issued final regulations that classify insured depository institutions by capital levels and require the appropriate federal banking regulator to take prompt action to resolve the problems of any insured institution that fails to satisfy the capital standards. Under such regulations, a well-capitalized bank is one that is not subject to any regulatory order or directive to meet any specific capital level and that has or exceeds the following capital levels: a total risk-based capital ratio of 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%, and a leverage ratio of 5%. As of December 31, 2005, the Bank was well-capitalized as defined by the regulations. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Legislative, Legal and Regulatory Developments: The banking industry is generally subject to extensive regulatory oversight. The Company, as a publicly held bank holding company, and the Bank, as a state-chartered bank with deposits insured by the FDIC, are subject to a number of laws and regulations. Many of these laws and regulations have undergone significant change in recent years. These laws and regulations impose restrictions on activities, minimum capital requirements, lending and deposit restrictions and numerous other requirements. Future changes to these laws and regulations, and other new financial services laws and regulations, are likely and cannot be predicted with certainty. Future legislative or regulatory change, or changes in enforcement practices or court rulings, may have a dramatic and potentially adverse impact on the Company and its bank and other subsidiaries. USA Patriot Act. The President of the United States signed the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (the Patriot Act), into law on October 26, 2001. The Patriot Act establishes a wide variety of new and enhanced ways of combating international terrorism. The provisions that affect banks (and other financial institutions) most directly are contained in Title III of the act. In general, Title III amended existing law - primarily the Bank Secrecy Act - to provide the Secretary of Treasury (the Treasury) and other departments and agencies of the federal government with enhanced authority to identify, deter, and punish international money laundering and other crimes. Among other things, the Patriot Act prohibits financial institutions from doing business with foreign shell banks and requires increased due diligence for private banking transactions and correspondent accounts for foreign banks. In addition, financial institutions will have to follow new minimum verification of identity standards for all new accounts and will be permitted to share information with law enforcement authorities under circumstances that were not previously permitted. These and other provisions of the Patriot Act became effective at varying times and the Treasury and various federal banking agencies are responsible for issuing regulations to implement the new law. Additional Information The Company maintains a website at www.mybankconnection.com and is not including the information contained on this website as a part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company makes available free of charge (other than an investors own internet access charges) through its website its Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. The Companys business strategy includes the continuation of growth plans, and its financial condition and results of operations could be affected if its business strategies are not effectively executed. The Company intends to continue pursuing a growth strategy for its business through acquisitions and de novo branching. The Companys prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties occasionally encountered by financial services companies in growth stages, which may include the following:  Maintaining loan quality;  Maintaining adequate management personnel and information systems to oversee such growth; and  Maintaining adequate control and compliance functions. 14 Operating Results. There is no assurance that existing offices or future offices will maintain or achieve deposit levels, loan balances or other operating results necessary to avoid losses or produce profits. The Companys growth and de novo branching strategy necessarily entails growth in overhead expenses as it routinely adds new offices and staff. The Companys historical results may not be indicative of future results or results that may be achieved as the company continue to increase the number and concentration of its branch offices. Development of Offices. There are considerable costs involved in opening branches and new branches generally do not generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs until they have been in operation for at least a year or more. Accordingly, the Companys de novo branches may be expected to negatively impact its earnings during this period of time until the branches reach certain economies of scale. Expansion into New Markets. Much of the Companys recent growth has been focused in the highly competitive Nashville, Knoxville and Clarksville metropolitan markets. The customer demographics and financial services offerings in these markets are unlike those found in the East Tennessee markets that the Company has historically served. In the Nashville, Knoxville and Clarksville markets the Company faces competition from a wide array of financial institutions. The Companys expansion into these new markets may be impacted if it is unable to meet customer demands or compete effectively with the financial institutions operating in these markets. Regulatory and Economic Factors. The Companys growth and expansion plans may be adversely affected by a number of regulatory and economic developments or other events. Failure to obtain required regulatory approvals, changes in laws and regulations or other regulatory developments and changes in prevailing economic conditions or other unanticipated events may prevent or adversely affect the Companys continued growth and expansion. Failure to successfully address the issues identified above could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations, and could adversely affect the Companys ability to successfully implement its business strategy. The Company could sustain losses if its asset quality declines. The Companys earnings are affected by its ability to properly originate, underwrite and service loans. The Company could sustain losses if it incorrectly assesses the creditworthiness of its borrowers or fails to detect or respond to deterioration in asset quality in a timely manner. Problems with asset quality could cause the Companys interest income and net interest margin to decrease and its provisions for loan losses to increase, which could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. An inadequate allowance for loan losses would reduce the Companys earnings. The risk of credit losses on loans varies with, among other things, general economic conditions, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and, in the case of a collateralized loan, the value and marketability of the collateral for the loan. Management maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon, among other things, historical experience, an evaluation of economic conditions and regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality. Based upon such factors, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectibility of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and takes a charge against earnings with respect to specific loans when their ultimate collectibility is considered questionable. If managements assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is inadequate to absorb losses, or if the bank regulatory authorities require the Bank to increase the allowance for loan losses as a part of their examination process, the Companys earnings and capital could be significantly and adversely affected. 15 Liquidity needs could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. The Company relies on dividends from the Bank as its primary source of funds. The primary source of funds of the Bank are customer deposits and loan repayments. While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans. The ability of borrowers to repay loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups, reductions in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, inclement weather, natural disasters and international instability. Additionally, deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions. Accordingly, the Company may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such sources include Federal Home Loan Bank advances and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks. While the Company believes that these sources are currently adequate, there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to meet future liquidity demands. The Company may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth, capital expenditures or other investments or liquidate assets should such sources not be adequate. Competition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect the Companys profitability. The banking business is highly competitive and the Company experiences competition in each of its markets from many other financial institutions. The Company competes with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other mutual funds, as well as other community banks and super-regional and national financial institutions that operate offices in the Companys primary market areas and elsewhere. Additionally, the Company faces competition from de novo community banks, including those with senior management who were previously affiliated with other local or regional banks or those controlled by investor groups with strong local business and community ties. These de novo community banks may offer higher deposit rates or lower cost loans in an effort to attract the Companys customers, and may attempt to hire the Companys management and employees. The Company competes with these other financial institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, the Company has to attract its customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. The Company expects competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. The Companys profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete with an array of financial institutions in its market areas. The Company may face risks with respect to future expansion. From time to time the Company may engage in additional de novo branch expansion as well as the acquisition of other financial institutions or parts of those institutions. The Company may also consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services. In addition, the Company may receive future inquiries and have discussions with potential acquirors of the Company. Acquisitions and mergers involve a number of risks, including:  the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners;  inaccuracies in the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution;  the time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management and opening new offices, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;  the Companys ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to its existing shareholders; 16  the diversion of the Companys managements attention to the negotiation of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses;  entry into new markets where the Company lacks experience;  the introduction of new products and services into the Companys business;  the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short-term effects on the Companys results of operations; and  the risk of loss of key employees and customers. The Company may incur substantial costs to expand. There can be no assurance that integration efforts for any future mergers or acquisitions will be successful. Also, the Company may issue equity securities, including common stock and securities convertible into shares of the Companys common stock in connection with future acquisitions, which could cause ownership and economic dilution to the Companys shareholders. There is no assurance that, following any future mergers or acquisitions, the Companys integration efforts will be successful or the Company, after giving effect to the acquisition, will achieve profits comparable to or better than its historical experience. The Companys business is subject to the success of the local economies where it operates. The Companys success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts in its market areas. If the communities in which the Company operates do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are unfavorable, the Companys business may not succeed. Adverse economic conditions in the Companys specific market areas could reduce its growth rate, affect the ability of its customers to repay their loans to the Company and generally affect its financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the Company cannot give any assurance that it will benefit from any market growth or favorable economic conditions in its primary market areas if they do occur. Any adverse market or economic conditions in the state of Tennessee may increase the risk that the Companys borrowers will be unable to timely make their loan payments. In addition, the market value of the real estate securing loans as collateral could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 75.82% of the Companys loans held for investment were secured by real estate. Of this amount, approximately 41.87% were commercial real estate loans, 27.76% were residential real estate loans and 30.37% were construction and development loans. Any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses caused by adverse market or economic conditions in the state of Tennessee could adversely affect the value of the Companys assets, revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Changes in interest rates may affect the Companys level of interest income, the primary component of its gross revenue, as well as the level of its interest expense. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Companys control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. Accordingly, changes in interest rates could decrease the Companys net interest income. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect the Companys ability to originate real estate loans, the value of the Companys assets and the Companys ability to realize gains from the sale of its assets, all of which ultimately affects the Companys earnings. The Company relies heavily on the services of key personnel. The Company depends substantially on the strategies and management services of R. Stan Puckett, its Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Although the Company has entered into an employment agreement with him, the loss of the services of Mr. Puckett could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also dependent on certain other key officers who have important customer relationships or are instrumental to its operations. Changes in key personnel and their responsibilities may be disruptive to the Companys business and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. 17 The Company believes that its future results will also depend in part upon its attracting and retaining highly skilled and qualified management and sales and marketing personnel, particularly in those areas where the Company may open new branches. Competition for such personnel is intense, and the Company cannot assure you that it will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. The Company is subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict its activities. The Company operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies including the Board of Governors of the FRB, the FDIC and the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions. The Companys regulatory compliance is costly and restricts certain of its activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices. The Company is also subject to capitalization guidelines established by its regulators, which require it to maintain adequate capital to support its growth. The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time, and the Company cannot predict the effects of these changes on its business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, the Companys cost of compliance could adversely affect its ability to operate profitably. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq that are now applicable to the Company, have increased the scope, complexity and cost of corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices. As a result, the Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, greater compliance costs. The Companys recent results may not be indicative of its future results. The Company may not be able to sustain its historical rate of growth or may not even be able to grow its business at all. In addition, the Companys recent growth may distort some of its historical financial ratios and statistics. In the future, the Company may not have the benefit of several recently favorable factors, such as a generally stable interest rate environment, a strong residential mortgage market, or the ability to find suitable expansion opportunities. Various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations and competition, may also impede or prohibit the Companys ability to expand its market presence. The Company is subject to Tennessee anti-takeover statutes and certain charter provisions which could decrease its chances of being acquired even if the acquisition is in the Companys shareholders best interests. As a Tennessee corporation, the Company is subject to various legislative acts which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions. These statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire the Company and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if the acquisition of the Company would be in its shareholders best interests. The Companys amended and restated charter also contains provisions which may make it difficult for another entity to acquire it without the approval of a majority of the disinterested directors on its board of directors. The amount of common stock owned by, and other compensation arrangements with, the Companys officers and directors may make it more difficult to obtain shareholder approval of potential takeovers that they oppose. As of March 10, 2006, directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately 12.74% of the Companys common stock. Agreements with the Companys senior management also provide for significant payments under certain circumstances following a change in control. These compensation arrangements, together with the common stock and option ownership of the Companys board of directors and management, could make it difficult or expensive to obtain majority support for shareholder proposals or potential acquisition proposals of us that the Companys directors and officers oppose. The Companys continued pace of growth may require it to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed. 18 The Company is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations. While the Companys capital resources will satisfy its capital requirements for the foreseeable future, the Company may at some point, however, need to raise additional capital to support its continued growth. The Companys ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside its control, and on its financial performance. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure its shareholders that it will be able to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to it. If the Company cannot raise additional capital when needed, its ability to further expand its operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired. The success and growth of the Companys business will depend on its ability to adapt to technological changes. The banking industry and the ability to deliver financial services is becoming more dependent on technological advancement, such as the ability to process loan applications over the Internet, accept electronic signatures, provide process status updates instantly and on-line banking capabilities and other customer expected conveniences that are cost efficient to the Companys business processes. As these technologies are improved in the future, the Company may, in order to remain competitive, be required to make significant capital expenditures. Even though the Companys common stock is currently traded on The Nasdaq National Market, the trading volume in its common stock has been thin and the sale of substantial amounts of the Companys common stock in the public market could depress the price of its common stock. The Company cannot say with any certainty when a more active and liquid trading market for its common stock will develop or be sustained. Because of this, the Companys shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at the volumes, prices, or times that they desire. The Company cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of its common stock in the market, or availability of shares of its common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of the Companys common stock. The Company, therefore, can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of its common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, would not cause the price of its common stock to decline or impair its ability to raise capital through sales of its common stock. The market price of the Companys common stock may fluctuate in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to its performance. General market price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices. The Company may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future which could dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders. In order to maintain its capital at desired levels or required regulatory levels, or to fund future growth, the Companys board of directors may decide from time to time to issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of its common stock. The sale of these shares may significantly dilute the Companys shareholders ownership interest as a shareholder and the per share book value of its common stock. New investors in the future may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to its current shareholders which may adversely impact its current shareholders. The Companys ability to declare and pay dividends is limited by law and it may be unable to pay future dividends. The Company derives its income solely from dividends on the shares of common stock of the Bank. The Banks ability to declare and pay dividends is limited by its obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other general restrictions on its dividends that are applicable to banks that are regulated by the FDIC and the Department of Financial Institutions. In addition, the FRB may impose restrictions on the Companys ability to pay dividends on its common stock. As a result, the Company cannot assure its shareholders that it will declare or pay dividends on shares of its common stock in the future. 19 Holders of the Companys junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of its common shareholders. The Company has supported its continued growth through the issuance of trust preferred securities from special purpose trusts and accompanying junior subordinated debentures. At December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding trust preferred securities and accompanying junior subordinated debentures totaling $13.4 million. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities of these trusts are conditionally guaranteed by the Company. Further, the accompanying junior subordinated debentures the Company issued to the trusts are senior to its shares of common stock. As a result, the Company must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on its common stock and, in the event of its bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on its common stock. The Company has the right to defer distributions on its junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid on its common stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. None.
