ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS RISK FACTORS Our future operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These major risks and uncertainties are discussed below. There may be additional risks and uncertainties which we do not believe are currently material or are not yet known to us but which may become such in the future. Some of the risks and uncertainties which may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may materially and adversely affect our operating results are as follows: RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS WE CURRENTLY HAVE A NUMBER OF OBLIGATIONS THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET WITHOUT GENERATING ADDITIONAL INCOME OR RAISING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. IF WE CANNOT GENERATE ADDITIONAL INCOME OR RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE NEAR FUTURE, WE MAY BECOME INSOLVENT AND/OR BE MADE BANKRUPT AND/OR OUR MAY BECOME ILLIQUID OR WORTHLESS. As of December 31, 2005, our cash balance was approximately $122,000 and our outstanding accounts payable and current liabilities totaled approximately $12.2 million. In particular, we have some significant creditors that comprise a substantial proportion of outstanding obligations, including many that have obtained judgments against us, that we might not be able to satisfy. If we do not receive sufficient financing or sufficient funds from our operations we may (i) liquidate assets, (ii) seek or be forced into bankruptcy and/or (iii) continue operations, but incur material harm to our business, operations or financial condition. These measures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern. Additionally, because of our financial condition, our Board of Directors has a duty to our creditors that may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. When a Delaware corporation is operating in the vicinity of insolvency, the Delaware courts have imposed upon the corporation's directors a fiduciary duty to the corporation's creditors. Our Board of Directors may be required to make decisions that favor the interests of creditors at the expense of our stockholders to fulfill its fiduciary duty. For instance, we may be required to preserve our assets to maximize the repayment of debts versus employing the assets to further grow our business and increase shareholder value. If we cannot generate enough income from our operations or are unable to locate additional funds through financing, we will not have sufficient resources to continue operations. WE HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES, AND MAY HAVE TO FURTHER REDUCE OUR COSTS BY CURTAILING FUTURE OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE AS A BUSINESS. Although for the year ended December 31, 2005, our net income from operations was $5.9 million, $7 million of our revenue was recognized from the expiration of distribution contracts and other income, and we have incurred significant net losses in previous years. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our net loss from operations was $2.5 million and since inception, we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flow. As of December 31, 2005 we had an accumulated deficit of $133 million. Our ability to fund our capital requirements out of our available cash and cash generated from our operations depends on a number of factors. Some of these factors include the progress of our product distributions and licensing, the rate of growth of our business, and our products' commercial success. If we cannot generate positive cash flow from operations, we will have to continue to reduce our costs and raise working capital from other sources. These measures could include selling or consolidating certain operations or assets, and delaying, canceling or scaling back product development and marketing programs. These measures could materially and adversely affect our ability to publish successful titles, and may not be enough to permit us to operate profitability, or at all. OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT A FINANCING TRANSACTION TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF YOUR STOCK. If we are not acquired by or merge with another entity or if we are not able to raise additional capital by sale or license of certain of our assets, we may need to consummate a financing transaction to receive additional liquidity. This additional financing may take the form of raising additional capital through public or private equity offerings or debt financing. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, we cannot be certain that additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms and our stockholders will likely experience substantial dilution. Our certificate of incorporation provides for the issuance of preferred stock however we currently do not have any preferred stock issued and outstanding. Any new equity securities issued may have greater rights, preferences or privileges than our existing common stock. Material shortage of capital will require us to take drastic steps such as reducing our level of operations, disposing of selected assets, effecting financings on less than favorable terms or seeking protection under federal bankruptcy laws. - 8 - RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS TITUS INTERACTIVE SA (PLACED IN INVOLUNTARY BANKRUPTCY IN JANUARY, 2005) CONTROLS A MAJORITY OF OUR VOTING STOCK AND CAN ELECT A MAJORITY OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND PREVENT AN ACQUISITION OF US THAT IS FAVORABLE TO OUR OTHER STOCKHOLDERS. ALTERNATIVELY, TITUS CAN ALSO CAUSE A SALE OF CONTROL OF OUR COMPANY THAT MAY NOT BE FAVORABLE TO OUR OTHER STOCKHOLDERS. Titus owns approximately 58 million shares of common stock. As a consequence, Titus can control substantially all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, subject to our stockholders' cumulative voting rights, and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. At our 2003 and 2002 annual stockholders meetings, Titus exercised its voting power to elect a majority of our Board of Directors. Currently, our Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer Herve Caen is a director of various Titus affiliates. This concentration of voting power could discourage or prevent a change in control that otherwise could result in a premium in the price of our common stock. Further, Titus' bankruptcy could lead to a sale by its liquidator or other representative in bankruptcy, of shares Titus holds in us, and/or a sale of Titus itself which would result in a sale of control of our Company and such a sale may not be favorable to our other stockholders . Such a sale, including if it involves a dispersion of shares to multiple stockholders, further could have the effect of making any business combination, or a sale of all of our shares as a whole, more difficult. THE LACK OF ANY CREDIT AGREEMENT HAS RESULTED IN A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN THE CASH AVAILABLE TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS. We are currently operating without a credit agreement or credit facility. The lack of a credit agreement or credit facility has significantly impeded our ability to fund our operations and has caused material harm to our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into a new credit agreement or that if we do enter into a new credit agreement, it will be on terms favorable to us. A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR REVENUES HISTORICALLY DEPENDED ON OUR DISTRIBUTORS' DILIGENT SALES EFFORTS. Avalon was the exclusive distributor for most of our products in Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa and the Middle East. Our agreement with Avalon was terminated following the liquidation of Avalon in February 2005. We subsequently appointed our wholly owned subsidiary Interplay Productions Ltd as our distributor for Europe. Vivendi had exclusive rights to distribute our products in North America and selected International territories. Our agreement with Vivendi expired in August 2005 and December 2005 for most of our products. Our revenues and cash flows could fall significantly and our business and financial results could suffer material harm if: o We fail to replace Vivendi as our distributor; or o Interplay Productions Ltd fails to effectively distribute our products. We typically sell to distributors and retailers on unsecured credit, with terms that vary depending upon the customer and the nature of the product. We confront the risk of non-payment from our customers, whether due to their financial inability to pay us, or otherwise. In addition, while we maintain a reserve for uncollectible receivables, the reserve may not be sufficient in every circumstance. As a result, a payment default by a significant customer could cause material harm to our business. WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE WITHOUT A CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR FINANCIAL OPERATIONS. We are presently without a CFO, and Mr. Caen has assumed the position of interim-CFO and continues as CFO to date until a replacement can be found. o - 9 - OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY IS BOTH SEASONAL AND CYCLICAL. IF WE FAIL TO DELIVER OUR PRODUCTS AT THE RIGHT TIMES, OUR SALES WILL SUFFER. Our business is highly seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand occurring in the fourth quarter. Our industry is also cyclical. The timing of hardware platform introduction is often tied to the year-end season and is not within our control. As new platforms are being introduced into our industry, consumers often choose to defer game software purchases until such new platforms are available, which would cause sales of our products on current platforms to decline. This decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the new platform. THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF FUTURE RESULTS MAY CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO REMAIN DEPRESSED OR TO DECLINE FURTHER. Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to several factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include: o demand for our products and our competitors' products; o the size and rate of growth of the market for interactive entertainment software; o changes in personal computer and video game console platforms; o the timing of announcements of new products by us and our competitors and the number of new products and product enhancements released by us and our competitors; o changes in our product mix; o the number of our products that are returned; and o the level of our international and original equipment manufacturer royalty and licensing net revenues. Many factors make it difficult to accurately predict the quarter in which we will ship our products. Some of these factors include: o the uncertainties associated with the interactive entertainment software development process; o approvals required from content and technology licensors; and o the timing of the release and market penetration of new game hardware platforms. THERE ARE HIGH FIXED COSTS TO DEVELOPING OUR PRODUCTS. IF OUR REVENUES DECLINE BECAUSE OF DELAYS IN THE INTRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS, OR IF THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DEFECTS OR DISSATISFACTION WITH OUR PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED. Although for the year ended December 31, 2005, our net income from operations was $5.9 million, $7 million of our revenue was recognized from the expiration of distribution contracts and other income, and we have incurred significant net losses in previous. Our losses in the past stemmed partly from the significant costs we incurred to develop our entertainment software products, product returns and price concessions. Moreover, a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed, with planned expenditures based largely on sales forecasts. At the same time, most of our products have a relatively short life cycle and sell for a limited period of time after their initial release, usually less than one year. Relatively fixed costs and short windows in which to earn revenues mean that sales of new products are important in enabling us to recover our development costs, to fund operations and to replace declining net revenues from older products. Our failure to accurately assess the commercial success of our new products, and our delays in releasing new products could reduce our net revenues and our ability to recoup development and operational costs. IF OUR PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE BROAD MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED SIGNIFICANTLY. Consumer preferences for interactive entertainment software are always changing and are extremely difficult to predict. Historically, few interactive entertainment software products have achieved continued market acceptance. Instead, a limited number of releases have become "hits" and have accounted for a substantial portion of revenues in our industry. Further, publishers with a history of producing hit titles have enjoyed a significant marketing advantage because of their heightened brand recognition and consumer loyalty. We expect the importance of introducing hit titles to increase in the future. We cannot assure you that our new products will achieve significant market acceptance, or that we will be able to sustain this acceptance for a significant length of time if we achieve it. - 10 - We believe that our future revenue will continue to depend on the successful production of hit titles on a continuous basis. Because we introduce a relatively limited number of new products in a given period, the failure of one or more of these products to achieve market acceptance could cause material harm to our business. Further, if our products do not achieve market acceptance, we could be forced to accept substantial product returns or grant significant pricing concessions to maintain our relationship with retailers and our access to distribution channels. If we are forced to accept significant product returns or grant significant pricing concessions, our business and financial results could suffer material harm. OUR RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS SUBJECTS US TO THE RISKS THAT THESE DEVELOPERS WILL NOT SUPPLY US WITH HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. Third party interactive entertainment software developers develop many of our software products. Since we depend on these developers in the aggregate, we remain subject to the following risks: o limited financial resources may force developers out of business prior to their completion of projects for us or require us to fund additional costs; and o the possibility that developers could demand that we renegotiate our arrangements with them to include new terms less favorable to us. INCREASED COMPETITION FOR SKILLED THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS ALSO HAS COMPELLED US TO AGREE TO MAKE ADVANCE PAYMENTS ON ROYALTIES AND TO GUARANTEE MINIMUM ROYALTY PAYMENTS TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSORS AND GAME DEVELOPERS. MOREOVER, IF THE PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO THESE ARRANGEMENTS, ARE NOT DELIVERED TIMELY, OR WITH ACCEPTABLE QUALITY, OR DO NOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT SALES VOLUMES TO RECOVER THESE ROYALTY ADVANCES AND GUARANTEED PAYMENTS, WE WOULD HAVE TO WRITE-OFF UNRECOVERED PORTIONS OF THESE PAYMENTS, WHICH COULD CAUSE MATERIAL HARM TO OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. WE COMPETE WITH A NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL, MARKETING AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES THAN WE DO. The greater resources of our competitors permit them to pay higher fees than we can to licensors of desirable motion picture, television, sports and character properties and to third party software developers. We compete primarily with other publishers of personal computer and video game console interactive entertainment software. Significant competitors include Electronic Arts Inc. and Activision, Inc. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do. In addition, integrated video game console hardware/software companies such as Sony Computer Entertainment, Nintendo, and Microsoft Corporation compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their respective platforms and they have generally discretionary approval authority over the products we develop for their platforms. Large diversified entertainment companies, such as The Walt Disney Company, and Time Warner Inc. many of which own substantial libraries of available content and have substantially greater financial resources, may decide to compete directly with us or to enter into exclusive relationships with our competitors. WE HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF KEY MANAGEMENT AND OTHER PERSONNEL. THE LOSS OF ANY SINGLE MEMBER OF MANAGEMENT OR KEY PERSON OR THE FAILURE TO HIRE AND INTEGRATE CAPABLE NEW KEY PERSONNEL COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. Our business requires extensive time and creative effort to produce and market. Our future success also will depend upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees and contractors, particularly software design and development personnel. Competition for highly skilled employees is intense, and we may fail to attract and retain such personnel. Alternatively, we may incur increased costs in order to attract and retain skilled employees. Our executive management team currently consists of CEO and interim CFO Herve Caen. Our failure to recruit or retain the services of key personnel, including competent executive management, or to attract and retain additional qualified employees could cause material harm to our business. - 11 - OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES EXPOSE US TO RISKS OF UNSTABLE FOREIGN ECONOMIES, DIFFICULTIES IN COLLECTION OF REVENUES, INCREASED COSTS OF ADMINISTERING INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS AND FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES. Our net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 57% and 75% of our total net revenues for years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Most of these revenues came from our distribution relationship with Vivendi , pursuant to which Vivendi became the exclusive distributor for most of our products in Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa and the Middle East and a recognition of revenue from international expiration of contracts during 2005. To the extent our resources allow, we intend to continue to expand our direct and indirect sales, marketing and product localization activities worldwide. Our international sales are subject to a number of inherent risks, including the following: o recessions in foreign economies may reduce purchases of our products; o translating and localizing products for international markets is time consuming and expensive; o accounts receivable are more difficult to collect and when they are collectible, they may take longer to collect; o regulatory requirements may change unexpectedly; o it is difficult and costly to staff and manage foreign operations; o fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; o political and economic instability; and o delays in market penetration of new platforms in foreign territories. These factors may cause material declines in our future international net revenues and, consequently, could cause material harm to our business. A significant, continuing risk we face from our international sales and operations stems from currency exchange rate fluctuations. Because we do not engage in currency hedging activities, fluctuations in currency exchange rates have caused significant reductions in our net revenues from international sales and licensing due to the loss in value upon conversion into U.S. Dollars. We may suffer similar losses in the future. OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO RETURN OUR PRODUCTS OR TO RECEIVE PRICING CONCESSIONS AND SUCH RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS COULD REDUCE OUR NET REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. We are exposed to the risk of product returns and pricing concessions with respect to our distributors. Our distributors allow retailers to return defective, shelf-worn and damaged products in accordance with negotiated terms, and also offer a 90-day limited warranty to our end users that our products will be free from manufacturing defects. In addition, our distributors provide pricing concessions to our customers to manage our customers' inventory levels in the distribution channel. Our distributors could be forced to accept substantial product returns and provide pricing concessions to maintain our relationships with retailers and their access to distribution channels. We have mitigated this risk in North America under our current distribution arrangement with Vivendi, as sales will be guaranteed with no offset for product returns and price concessions. WE DEPEND UPON THIRD PARTY LICENSES OF CONTENT FOR MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS. Many of our current and planned products, are lines based on original ideas or intellectual properties licensed from other parties. From time to time we may not be in compliance with certain terms of these license agreements, and our ability to market products based on these licenses may be negatively impacted. Moreover, disputes regarding these license agreements may also negatively impact our ability to market products based on these licenses. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain new licenses, or maintain or renew existing licenses, on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to maintain current licenses or obtain new licenses for the underlying content that we believe offers the greatest consumer appeal, we would either have to seek alternative, potentially less appealing licenses, or release products without the desired underlying content, either of which could limit our commercial success and cause material harm to our business. - 12 - OUR LICENSORS ARE ALSO OFTEN OUR COMPETITORS. WE MAY FAIL TO MAINTAIN EXISTING LICENSES, OR OBTAIN NEW LICENSES FROM PLATFORM COMPANIES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR TO OBTAIN RENEWALS OF EXISTING OR FUTURE LICENSES FROM LICENSORS. We are required to obtain a license to develop and distribute software for each of the video game console platforms for which we develop products, including a separate license for each of North America, Japan and Europe. We have obtained licenses to develop software for the Sony PlayStation and PlayStation 2, as well as video game platforms from Nintendo and Microsoft, who are also our competitors. Each of these companies has the right to approve the technical functionality and content of our products for their platforms prior to distribution. Typically, such license agreements give broad control to the licensor over the approval, manufacturing and shipment of products on their platform. Due to the competitive nature of the approval process, we typically must make significant product development expenditures on a particular product prior to the time we seek these approvals. Our inability to obtain these approvals or to obtain them on a timely basis could cause material harm to our business. OUR SALES VOLUME AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS DEPEND IN PART UPON THE NUMBER OF PRODUCT TITLES DISTRIBUTED BY HARDWARE COMPANIES FOR USE WITH THEIR VIDEO GAME PLATFORMS. Even after we have obtained licenses to develop and distribute software, we depend upon hardware companies such as Sony Computer Entertainment, Nintendo and Microsoft, or their designated licensees, to manufacture the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM media discs that contain our software. These discs are then run on the companies' video game consoles. This process subjects us to the following risks: o we are required to submit and pay for minimum numbers of discs we want produced containing our software, regardless of whether these discs are sold, shifting onto us the financial risk associated with poor sales of the software developed by us; and o reorders of discs are expensive, reducing the gross margin we receive from software releases that have stronger sales than initially anticipated and that require the production of additional discs. As a result, video game console hardware licensors can shift onto us the risk that if actual retailer and consumer demand for our interactive entertainment software differs from our forecasts, we must either bear the loss from overproduction or the lower per-unit revenues associated with producing additional discs. Either situation could lead to material reductions in our net revenues and operating results. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY INADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTIONS COULD PREVENT US FROM ENFORCING OR DEFENDING OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY. We regard our software as proprietary and rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary rights. We own or license various copyrights and trademarks, and hold the rights to one patent application related to one of our titles. While we provide "shrink-wrap" license agreements or limitations on use with our software, it is uncertain to what extent these agreements and limitations are enforceable. We are aware that some unauthorized copying occurs within the computer software industry, and if a significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying of our interactive entertainment software products were to occur, it could cause material harm to our business and financial results. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and software piracy can be a persistent problem, especially in some international markets. Further, the laws of some countries where our products are or may be distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or are weakly enforced. Legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in such countries, and as we leverage our software products using emerging technologies such as the Internet and online services, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing others' intellectual property rights may diminish. We cannot assure you that existing intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection for our products in connection with these emerging technologies. WE MAY UNINTENTIONALLY INFRINGE ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, WHICH COULD EXPOSE US TO SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS. As the number of interactive entertainment software products increases and the features and content of these products continue to overlap, software developers increasingly may become subject to infringement claims. Although we - 13 - believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others, it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement. From time to time, we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims. Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid or not, may be time consuming and expensive to defend. Intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following: o cease selling, incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; o obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property, which license, if available at all, may not be available on commercially favorable terms; or o redesign our interactive entertainment software products, possibly in a manner that reduces their commercial appeal. Any of these actions may cause material harm to our business and financial results. OUR BUSINESS IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND PROFITABILITY IS INCREASINGLY DRIVEN BY A FEW KEY TITLE RELEASES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DELIVER KEY TITLES, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE HARMED. Competition in our industry is intense. New videogame products are regularly introduced. Increasingly, profits and revenues in our industry are dominated by certain key product releases and are increasingly produced in conjunction with the latest consumer and media trends. Many of our competitors may have more finances and other resources for the development of product titles than we do. If our competitors develop more successful products, or if we do not continue to develop consistently high-quality products, our revenue will decline. IF WE FAIL TO ANTICIPATE CHANGES IN VIDEO GAME PLATFORMS AND TECHNOLOGY, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE HARMED. The interactive entertainment software industry is subject to rapid technological change. New technologies could render our current products or products in development obsolete or unmarketable. Some of these new technologies include: o operating systems such as Microsoft Windows Longhorn; o new media formats o releases of new video game consoles; o new video game systems by Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo and others. We must continually anticipate and assess the emergence of, and market acceptance of, new interactive entertainment software platforms well in advance of the time the platform is introduced to consumers. Because product development cycles are difficult to predict, we must make substantial product development and other investments in a particular platform well in advance of introduction of the platform. If the platforms for which we develop new software products or modify existing products are not released on a timely basis or do not attain significant market penetration, or if we develop products for a delayed or unsuccessful platform, our business and financial results could suffer material harm. New interactive entertainment software platforms and technologies also may undermine demand for products based on older technologies. Our success will depend in part on our ability to adapt our products to those emerging game platforms that gain widespread consumer acceptance. Our business and financial results may suffer material harm if we fail to: o anticipate future technologies and platforms and the rate of market penetration of those technologies and platforms; o obtain licenses to develop products for those platforms on favorable terms; or o create software for those new platforms on a timely basis. OUR SOFTWARE MAY BE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTIONS OR RATING SYSTEMS. Legislation is periodically introduced at the state and federal levels in the United States and in foreign countries to establish a system for providing consumers with information about graphic violence and sexually explicit material contained in interactive entertainment software products. In addition, many foreign countries have laws that permit governmental entities to censor the content of interactive entertainment software. We believe that mandatory government-run rating systems eventually will be adopted in many countries that are significant markets or potential markets for our products. We may be required to modify our products to comply with new regulations, which could delay the release of our products in those countries. - 14 - Due to the uncertainties regarding such rating systems, confusion in the marketplace may occur, and we are unable to predict what effect, if any, such rating systems would have on our business. In addition to such regulations, certain retailers have in the past declined to stock some of our products because they believed that the content of the packaging artwork or the products would be offensive to the retailer's customer base. While to date these actions have not caused material harm to our business, we cannot assure you that similar actions by our distributors or retailers in the future would not cause material harm to our business. RISKS RELATED TO OUR STOCK SOME PROVISIONS OF OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS MAY MAKE TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS DIFFICULT, WHICH COULD DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK AND INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE A PREMIUM PRICE FOR YOUR SHARES. Our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, provides for 5,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred Stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without any action by the stockholders, to issue up to 4,280,576 shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of such shares. 719,424 shares of Series A Preferred Stock was issued to Titus in the past, which amount has been fully converted into our common stock. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that: o eliminate the ability of stockholders to act by written consent and to call a special meeting of stockholders; and o require stockholders to give advance notice if they wish to nominate directors or submit proposals for stockholder approval. These provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over its market price and may adversely affect the market price, and the voting and other rights of the holders, of our common stock. OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE "PENNY STOCK" RULES WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. "Penny stocks" generally include equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share, which are not traded on a national stock exchange or on Nasdaq, and are issued by a company that has tangible net assets of less than $2,000,000 if the company has been operating for at least three years. The "penny stock" rules require, among other things, broker dealers to satisfy special sales practice requirements, including making individualized written suitability determinations and receiving a purchaser's written consent prior to any transaction. In addition, additional disclosure in connection with trades in the common stock are required, including the delivery of a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the "penny stock" market. These additional burdens imposed on broker-dealers may discourage them from effecting transactions in our common stock, which may make it more difficult for an investor to sell their shares and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. OUR STOCK IS VOLATILE The trading price of our common stock has previously fluctuated and could continue to fluctuate in response to factors that are largely beyond our control, and which may not be directly related to the actual operating performance of our business, including: o general conditions in the computer, software, entertainment, media or electronics industries; o changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts; o investor perceptions and expectations regarding our products, plans and strategic position and those of our competitors and customers; and o price and trading volume volatility of the broader public markets, particularly the high technology sections of the market. - 15 -
