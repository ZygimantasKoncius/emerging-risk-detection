D. Risk Factors Kimber is subject to a number of significant risks due to the nature of its business and the present stage of its business development. The following factors should be considered: Industry Risks Resource exploration and development is a high risk, speculative business. Resource exploration and development is a speculative business, characterized by a high number of failures. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits and no assurance can be given that any particular level of recovery or ore reserves will in fact be realized by Kimber or that any identified mineral deposit identified by Kimber will ever qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable) ore body which can be legally and economically exploited. Mineral exploration is subject to numerous industry operating hazards and risks, many of which are beyond Kimbers control and any one of which may have an adverse effect on its financial condition and operations. The operations in which Kimber has a direct or indirect interest will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to resource companies. Fires, power outages, labour disruptions, flooding, explosions, cave-ins, land slides and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labour are some of the industry operating risks involved in the operation of mines and the conduct of exploration programs. If any of these events were to occur, they could cause injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property. As a result, Kimber could be the subject of a regulatory investigation, potentially leading to penalties and suspension of operations. In addition, Kimber may have to make expensive repairs and could be the subject to legal liability. The occurrence of any of these operating risks and hazards may have an adverse effect on Kimbers financial condition and operati ons. 16 Metal prices have fluctuated widely in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future which may adversely affect the amount of revenues derived from production of mineral reserves. The commercial feasibility of Kimbers properties and its ability to arrange funding to conduct its planned exploration projects is dependent on, among other things, the price of gold and silver. Depending on the price to be received for any minerals produced, Kimber may determine that it is impractical to commence or continue commercial production. A reduction in the price of gold or silver may prevent Kimbers properties from being economically mined or result in the write-off of assets whose value is impaired as a result of low precious metals prices. Future revenues, if any, are expected to be in large part derived from the future mining and sale of gold and silver or interests related thereto. The prices of these commodities fluctuate and are affected by numerous factors beyond Kimber’s control including: · international economic and political conditions, · expectations of inflation or deflation, · international currency exchange rates, · interest rates, · global or regional consumptive patterns, · speculative activities, · levels of supply and demand, · increased production due to new mine developments, · decreased production due to mine closures, · improved mining and production methods, · availability and costs of metal substitutes, · metal stock levels maintained by producers and others, and · inventory carrying costs. The effect of these factors on the price of base and precious metals cannot be accurately predicted. If the price of gold and silver decreases, the value of Kimber’s assets would be materially and adversely effected. Kimber faces substantial competition within the mining industry from other mineral companies with much greater financial and technical resources and may not be able to effectively compete which would have an adverse effect on Kimbers financial condition and operations. 17 The resource industry is intensively competitive in all of its phases, and Kimber competes with many companies possessing much greater financial and technical research resources. Competition is particularly intense with respect to the acquisition of desirable undeveloped gold and silver properties. The principal competitive factors in the acquisition of such undeveloped properties include the staff and data necessary to identify, investigate and purchase such properties, and the financial resources necessary to acquire and develop such properties. Competition could adversely affect Kimbers ability to acquire suitable prospects for exploration in the future. The mining industry is facing increasing operating and capital costs which may adversely affect the viability of existing and proposed mining projects. As a result of the increase in the prices of the labour and materials, to some extent caused by an increase in commodity prices, including the prices of the metals being mined by the industry, the capital cost of mining projects has significantly increased in the past few years. Increasing operating costs are a factor that must be built in to the economic model for any mining project. Significant operating cost increases have been experienced by the industry in recent years, the effect of which has been to reduce profit margin for some mining projects. Such increases in both operating and capital costs need to be factored into economic assessments of existing and proposed mining projects and may increase the financing requirements for such projects or render such projects uneconomic. Company Risks Kimbers exploration efforts may be unsuccessful in locating viable mineral resources. Resource exploration and, if warranted, development is a speculative business, characterized by a number of significant risks, including, among other things, unprofitable efforts resulting not only from the failure to discover mineral deposits but also from finding mineral deposits, which, though present, are insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production. There is no certainty that the expenditures that have been made and may be made in the future by Kimber related to the exploration of its properties will result in discoveries of mineralized material in commercial quantities. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits and no assurance can be given that any particular level of recovery or ore reserves will in fact be realized or that any identified mineral deposit will ever qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable) ore body which can be legally and economically exploited. If Kimber is unable to develop acceptable overall silver recovery levels, the Carmen deposit may not be a viable project and Kimber will have to continue to explore for a viable deposit or cease operations. Currently, Kimbers metallurgical recovery tests for silver vary significantly across the Carmen deposit, ranging from a low of 8.6% to a high of 97.3%. Kimbers overall silver metallurgical recoveries may not be adequate for the Carmen deposit to be commercially viable. If Kimber resource estimates are not indicative of the actual gold and silver that can be mined, the mineable gold and silver that can be recovered from the Carmen deposit may be less than the resource estimate and the Carmen deposit may not be a viable project. Assays results from core drilling or reverse circulation drilling can be subject to errors at the laboratory analyzing the drill samples. In addition, reverse circulation or core drilling may lead to samples which may not be representative of the gold and silver ore in the entire deposit. Resource estimates are based on interpretation of available facts and extrapolation or interpolation of data and may not be representative of the actual deposit. All of these factors may lead to a resource estimate which is overstated. 18 If Kimbers resource estimates for the Carmen deposit are not indicative of actual recoverable gold and silver, Kimber will have to continue to explore for a viable deposit or cease operations. Kimber has a limited history as an exploration company and does not have any experience in putting a mining project into production. Kimber has only been actively engaged in exploration since 1999. Kimber does not hold any mineral reserves and does not generate any revenues from production. Kimbers success will depend largely upon its ability to locate and develop commercially productive mineral reserves, which may never happen. Further Kimber does not have any experience in taking a mining project to production. As a result of these factors, it is difficult to evaluate Kimbers prospects, and its future success is more uncertain than if it had a longer or more proven history. Kimber expects to continue to incur losses and may never achieve profitability, which in turn may harm the future operating performance and may cause the market price of Kimbers Common Shares to decline. Kimber has incurred net losses every year since inception on March 31, 1995 and as of June 30, 2008 had an accumulated deficit of $13,477,772. Kimber incurred a net loss of $2,937,925 for the year ended June 30, 2008 and $3,813,938 for the year ended June 30, 2007 (2006: $2,363,420 2005: $1,825,982; 2004: $1,513,811), all in accordance with Canadian GAAP. If Kimber does not achieve profitability it will have to raise additional financing or shut down its operations. Kimbers title to its mineral properties and its validity may be disputed in the future by others claiming title to all or part of such properties. Kimber owns the mining concessions, which constitute its property holdings. Under the Mexican law, the concessions may be subject to prior unregistered agreements or transfers, which may affect the validity of Kimbers ownership of such concessions. A claim by a third party asserting prior unregistered agreements or transfer on any of Kimbers mineral properties, especially where commercially productive mineral reserves have been located, could adversely result in Kimber losing commercially productive mineral reserves. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, it may potentially affect Kimbers current operations due to the high costs of defending against such claims and its impact on senior management's time. If Kimber loses a commercially productive mineral reserve, such a loss could lower Kimbers revenues or cause it to cease operations if this reserve represented all of Kimbers operations at the time of the loss. Kimbers properties are located in Mexico, which can lead to difficulty with changes in political conditions and regulations, currency exchange and, in obtaining financing, finding and hiring qualified people or obtaining all necessary services for Kimbers operations in Mexico. Kimbers principal project is located in Mexico. Mexico has in the past been subject to political instability, changes and uncertainties, which, if they were to arise again, could cause changes to existing governmental regulations affecting mineral exploration and mining activities. Kimbers mineral exploration and mining activities in Mexico may be adversely affected in varying degrees by changing government regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions that increase the costs related to Kimbers activities or maintaining its properties. The cost of exploration and future capital and operating costs are affected by foreign exchange rates for the Canadian dollar, United States dollar and Mexican peso. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the United States dollar and Mexican peso versus the Canadian dollar could lead to increased costs reported in Canadian dollars or foreign exchange losses in respect to United States dollar or Mexican peso working capital balances held by Kimber. 19 It may be difficult for Kimber to obtain necessary financing for its planned exploration or development activities because of their location in Mexico. Also, it may be difficult to find and hire qualified people in the mining industry who are situated in Mexico or to obtain all of the necessary services or expertise in Mexico or to conduct operations on its projects at reasonable rates. If qualified people and services or expertise cannot be obtained in Mexico, Kimber may need to seek and obtain those services from people located outside of Mexico which will require work permits and compliance with applicable laws and could result in delays and higher costs to Kimber to conduct its operations in Mexico. Kimber originally contemplated an open pit mining operation on the Carmen deposit, however it is currently contemplating the possibility of a combined open pit and underground mining operation, the effect of which, if it were to proceed to production, would expose Kimber to increased costs, potential time delays and risks to underground workers. The change in concept from an open pit to a combined open pit and underground mining operation would, if it proceeds on this basis expose Kimber to the inherent risks of underground mining including increased costs, time delays in developing underground operations and safety issues. The development of any mine plan and feasibility study must take these factors into consideration and may negatively impact the viability of the project. If the Carmen deposit is not a viable project as a combined open pit/underground mine Kimber would have to continue to explore for a viable deposit or cease operations. Kimber has not completed an environmental impact statement, nor has it received the necessary permits for water or explosives to conduct mining operations. The department responsible for environmental protection in Mexico is SEMARNAT and has broad authority to shut down and/or levy fines against facilities that do not comply with environmental regulations or standards. Regulations require that an environmental impact statement, known in Mexico as a Manifiesto de Impacto Ambiental or MIA, be prepared by a third-party contractor for submittal to SEMARNAT. An MIA is required prior to mine construction. Studies required to support the MIA include a detailed analysis of the following areas: soil, water, vegetation, wildlife, cultural resources and socio-economic impacts. The regulatory process in Mexico does not have a public review component but proof of local community support for a project is required to gain final MIA approval. A risk analysis must also be prepared in conjunction with the MIA for approval by SEMARNAT. To date this risk analysis has not been prepared A number of other approvals, licenses and permits are required for various aspects of a mine development. The most significant permits for the development of the Monterde Property, other than MIA approval, are water rights concessions, or permits to extract water, issued by the National Water Commission, and a permit for consumption, use and storage of explosives, or blasting permit, issued by the Mexican National Defence Secretariat. Failure to obtain the necessary permits would adversely affect progress of Kimbers operations and would delay the beginning of commercial operations. The Monterde Property is located in the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico which have been subject to episodes of unusually high rainfall in past years resulting in washouts and erosion of soil. Continuing increased rainfall may result in increased costs and delays in operations. Seasonal rains are a factor that must be considered when carrying on operations in areas such as the Sierra Madre where excessive rain fall may hamper operations. Some other companies carrying on operations in areas of heavy seasonal rains have been severely impacted by the rainfall and on occasion have been required to cease operations. If Kimbers operations are severely impacted by the weather, then it may be required to carry out remedial work and/or cease operations until the seasonal rains come to an end. 20 Kimber depends on key personnel for critical management decisions and industry contacts but does not maintain key person insurance. Kimber is dependent on a relatively small number of key personnel, the loss of any of whom could have an adverse effect on the operations of Kimber. Kimbers success is dependent to a great degree on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified management personnel. The loss of such key personnel, through incapacity or otherwise, would require Kimber to seek and retain other qualified personnel and could compromise the pace and success of its exploration activities. Kimber does not maintain key person insurance in the event of a loss of any such key personnel. Kimber does not have a full staff of technical people and relies upon outside consultants to provide critical services. Kimber has a relatively small staff and depends upon its ability to hire consultants with the appropriate background and expertise as they are required to carry out specific tasks. Kimbers inability to hire the appropriate consultants at the appropriate time could adversely impact Kimbers ability to advance its exploration activities. Kimber will need to raise additional capital though the sale of its securities, resulting in dilution to the existing shareholders, and if such funding is not available, Kimbers operations would be adversely effected. Kimber does not generate any revenues from production and does not have sufficient financial resources to undertake by itself all of its planned exploration programs. Kimber has limited financial resources and has financed its operations primarily through the sale of Kimbers securities such as Common Shares. Kimber will need to continue its reliance on the sale of its securities for future financing, resulting in dilution to existing shareholders. Further exploration programs will depend on Kimbers ability to obtain additional financing which may not be available under favourable terms, if at all. If adequate financing is not available, Kimber may not be able to commence or continue with its exploration programs. Future sales of Kimbers Common Shares into the public market by holders of Kimber options and Warrants may lower the market price, which may result in losses to Kimbers shareholders. As of September 25, 2008 Kimber had 62,086,620 Common Shares issued and outstanding. In addition, as of September 25, 2008 2,817,000 Common Shares were issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, all of which may be exercised in the future resulting in dilution to Kimber’s shareholders. Of these amounts, senior officers and directors of Kimber own, as a group, 5,897,656 Common Shares (9.5%) and stock options to acquire an additional 1,955,000 Common Shares. Kimber may issue stock options to purchase an additional 1,957,362 Common Shares remaining under its existing stock option plan. Most of these Common Shares, including the Common Shares to be issued upon exercise of the outstanding options, are freely tradable. In addition as of September 25, 2008 there were 4,000,000 outstanding warrants to purchase Common Shares of Kimber at an exercise price of $1.25 per share. Some of the Common Shares to be issued upon exercise of the outstanding warrants are freely tradable after July 11, 2008. Also, as of September 25, 2008 there were 2,000,000 outstanding warrants to purchase Common Shares of Kimber at an exercise price of $1.80 per share. Some of the Common Shares to be issued upon exercise of the outstanding warrants will be freely tradable after January 24, 2009. 21 Sales of substantial amounts of Kimbers Common Shares into the public market, by Kimbers officers or directors or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants, or even the perception by the market that such sales may occur, may lower the market price of its Common Shares. Kimber has no history of paying dividends, does not expect to pay dividends in the immediate future and may never pay dividends. Since incorporation, Kimber has not paid any cash or other dividends on its Common Shares and does not expect to pay such dividends in the foreseeable future, as all available funds will be invested primarily to finance its mineral exploration programs. Kimbers business involves risks for which Kimber may not be adequately insured, if it is insured at all. In the course of exploration, development and production of mineral properties, certain risks, and in particular, unexpected or unusual geological operating conditions including rock bursts, cave-ins, fires, flooding and earthquakes may occur. It is not always possible to fully insure against such risks. Kimber does not currently have insurance against all such risks and may decide not to take out insurance against all such risks as a result of high premiums or other reasons. Should such liabilities arise, they could reduce or eliminate any future profitability and result in increasing costs and a decline in the value of the securities of Kimber. Kimbers activities are subject to environmental liability, which would have an adverse effect on its financial condition and operations. Kimber is not aware of any claims for damages related to any impact that its operations have had on the environment but it may become subject to such claims in the future. An environmental claim could adversely affect Kimbers business due to the high costs of defending against such claims and its impact on senior management's time. Also, environmental regulations may change in the future which could adversely affect Kimbers operations including the potential to curtail or cease exploration programs or to preclude entirely the economic development of a mineral property. The extent of any future changes to environmental regulations cannot be predicted or quantified, but it should be assumed that such regulations would become more stringent in the future. Generally, new regulations will result in increased compliance costs, including costs for obtaining permits, delays or fines resulting from loss of permits or failure to comply with the new regulations. Risks For U.S. Holders U.S. investors may not be able to enforce their civil liabilities against Kimber or its directors and officers. It may be difficult to bring and enforce suits against Kimber which is incorporated and situated in the Province of British Columbia, Canada and does not have assets located in the United States. With the exception of three (3) directors who are residents of the U.S., the officers and directors of Kimber are residents of British Columbia and Ontario, having all or a substantial portion of their assets located outside of the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult for U.S. shareholders of Kimber to effect service of process on these persons within the U.S. or to enforce judgements obtained in the U.S. based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against Kimber or its officers and most of its directors. In addition, U.S. shareholders of Kimber should not assume that the courts of Canada (i) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against Kimber, its officers or directors predi cated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws or other laws of the U.S., or (ii) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against Kimber, its officers or directors predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws or other laws of the U.S. 22 Kimber could be deemed a Passive Foreign Investment Company, which could have negative consequences for U.S. investors. Potential investors who are U.S. taxpayers should be aware that Kimber may be a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for the current fiscal year, and may also have been a PFIC in prior years and may also be a PFIC in subsequent years. See Taxation-United States Federal Income Tax Consequence-Passive Foreign Investment Company. If Kimber is a PFIC for any year during a U.S. taxpayers holding period, then such U.S. taxpayer generally will be required to treat any so-called excess distribution received on its Common Shares, or any gain realized upon a disposition of Common Shares, as ordinary income and to pay an interest charge on a portion of such distribution or gain, unless the taxpayer makes a valid qualified electing fund (QEF) election or a mark-to-market election with respect to the Shares of Kimber. In certain circumstances, the sum of the tax and the interest charge may exce ed the amount of the excess distribution received, or the amount of proceeds of disposition realized, by the taxpayer. A U.S. taxpayer who makes a QEF election generally must report on a current basis its share of Kimbers net capital gain and ordinary earnings for any year in which Kimber is a PFIC, whether or not Kimber distributes any amounts to its shareholders. A QEF election will only be effective if Kimber provides certain information to the U.S. holders. There can be no assurances Kimber can, or will comply with these requirements. A U.S. taxpayer who makes the mark-to-market election generally must include as ordinary income each year the excess of the fair market value of the Common Shares over the taxpayers tax basis therein. If Kimber is (or has been) a PFIC and at any time has a non-U.S. corporate subsidiary that is a PFIC, U.S. Holders generally would be deemed to own, and also would be subject to the PFIC rules with respect to, their indirect ownership interests in any such lower-tier PFIC. A mark-to-market election under the PFIC rules with respect to Kimber would not apply to a lower-tier PFIC, and a U.S. Holder would not be able to make such an election with respect to its indirect ownership interest in any lower-tier PFIC.
