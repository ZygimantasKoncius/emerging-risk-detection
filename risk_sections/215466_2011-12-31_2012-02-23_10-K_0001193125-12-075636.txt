Item 1A. Risk Factors. NON PRODUCING AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES Joaquin Project  Argentina: The Joaquin silver and gold development project is located in the Santa Cruz province of southern Argentina approximately 43 miles (70kms) north of the Companys Martha mine. The property is accessed by all weather dirt roads, leading north-northeast from the town of Gobernador Gregores. The Joaquin property encompasses over 70,819 acres (28,459 hectares) of exploration concessions. 46,114 acres (18,460 hectares) are held by Mirasol Resources Ltd., the Companys joint venture partner, and 24,705 acres (9,999 hectares) are held by Coeur Argentina. In November 2006, the Company entered into an exploration and joint venture agreement with Mirasol Resources Ltd., for two properties termed Joaquin and Sascha (under terms of the agreement, the Company terminated its option interest in Sascha). In November 2007, the Company commenced exploration on the Joaquin property. Since that time the Company has defined silver and gold mineralization in two deposits at Joaquin  La Negra and La Morocha  and has recently commenced work on detailed drilling and other technical, economic and environmental programs which it expects will lead to completion of a feasibility study. The Company currently has a 51% participating and managing equity interest in the Joaquin property based on the agreement. Upon completion of a feasibility study, the Company will have earned an additional 10% participating and management interest in the property, bringing its total to 61%. The Company has further rights to increase its participating interest in the property to 71% subject to other conditions in the agreement. The geology of the Joaquin property consists dominantly of various volcanic rocks of the Jurassic-aged Chon Aike Formation, the host to most of the precious metal deposits discovered to-date in the Santa Cruz province, with lesser amounts of intrusive rocks associated with the Chon Aike Formation. Collectively, the volcanic and intrusive rock units form a prominent geologic domain in the province termed the Deseado Massif. Silver and Gold mineralization at Joaquin occurs in epithermal veins, breccia, stockwork veinlets and mantos within the favorable units of the Chon Aike Formation. Occurrences of lead and zinc mineralization have also been discovered. Locally, the rocks of the Deseado Massif are covered by Tertiary-aged basalt and younger unconsolidated sediments, that post-date silver and gold mineralization. 38 Table of Contents Year-end Mineralized Material  Joaquin Development Property 2011 2010 2009 (1,2,3,4) Short tons (000s) 4,050   Ounces of silver per ton 2.48   (1) Mineralized material is effective as of May 2011. Metal prices used to calculate mineralized material were $1,300 per ounce of gold and $20.00 per ounce of silver. Tons are shown reflecting the Companys current 51% managing equity interest in the Joaquin property. (2) Mineralized material was estimated with surface mine parameters and initial metallurgical test results. (3) Mineralized material estimates were prepared by a consulting engineering group from Santiago, Chile and supervised by A. Cruzat and C. Romo of the Companys exploration staff. (4) Mineralized material was estimated using 3-dimensional geologic modeling and geostatistical evaluation of the exploration drill data. Blocks must be influenced by at least two different drill holes within a distance corresponding to 100% of the variogram range of each deposit. EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY Exploration and reserve development expenditures of $26.3 million, $18.0 million and $15.8 million were incurred by the Company in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The main components of the 2011 program included:  Surface drilling to extend the strike length, and define the Guadalupe and La Patria deposits in the Palmarejo district and initial testing of several new targets in the district.  Drilling to define and expand known mineralized zones in and around the current Palmarejo surface and underground mine. The program was focused on the Tucson-Chapotillo zones with surface drilling and on the Rosario and 76 zones with underground drilling.  Surface drilling to expand the La Negra and La Morocha deposits in the Santa Cruz province of southern Argentina and exploration on the Joaquin property. Exploration drilling at the Martha mine and on the Satélite and Tornado in Argentina was also conducted.  Underground drilling to expand and define mineralization in the Raven Vein at Kensington.  Surface drilling to test extensions of the main north-northeast mineralized trends from Nevada Packard and Packard deposits within the greater Rochester property.  New surface trenching and sampling at San Bartolomé in Bolivia designed to expand and increase the confidence in ore reserves and mineralized material; the first systematic new sampling to be conducted since 2004. Coeur plans to spend $39.9 million in exploration during 2012 with approximately 84% of the budget earmarked for expansion of ore reserves and mineralized material at or near its existing operations at San Bartolomé (Bolivia), Martha (Argentina), Palmarejo (Mexico), Kensington (Alaska), Rochester (Nevada), and on its large exploration land holdings in Santa Cruz, Argentina, which include the Joaquin property. Mexico Exploration in Mexico was focused primarily in the Palmarejo district in the state of Chihuahua. A total of $13.2 million was spent in 2011 on mapping, sampling, drill target generation and drilling to find and define new silver and gold mineralization. A total of 263,189 feet (80,220 meters) was completed in the large Palmarejo district, the majority of which consisted of 141,598 feet (43,159 meters) of surface and underground drilling completed around the current Palmarejo surface and underground mine. The remainder was devoted to the Guadalupe and La Patria deposit areas and other new targets in the Palmarejo district. The budget for 2012 for exploration in Mexico is similar to 2011 at $16.6 million of which over 95% is to be allocated to the Palmarejo 39 Table of Contents district. A new program of exploration is planned to identify and acquire prospective new properties in other parts of Mexico. In 2010 the company agreed to sell its interest in 8 mining concessions at the El Realito property, which is located about 30 kilometers south of the Palmarejo mill facilities, for a total of $0.5 million and a graduated net smelter return royalty. Periodic payments totaling $0.2 million, have been made through December 31, 2011. In 2011, the Company acquired from Azteca Gold Corporation the Guerra al Tirano concessions, located in the south-southeast portion of the Palmarejo District, for a total cash cost of $1.2 million. The seller retains a 2% net smelter return royalty of which 1.5% (75%) can be purchased by the Company. Guerra al Tirano occurs on one of the many regional-scale northwest-trending mineralized structures that transect the Palmarejo district. USA  Kensington Exploration in 2011 consisted of drilling 20,127 feet (6,135 meters), at Kensington. The majority of this work was devoted to the Raven vein, with other drilling conducted on the Kimberly, Comet, and Kensington South targets. Raven is a shear-hosted , gold -in-quartz vein zone, which is parallel to and approximately 2,000 feet (600 meters) west of the main Kensington mine area. The Company plans for an additional drilling program in 2012 on Raven and other targets with a budget of $4.3 million. USA  Rochester The Company conducted a drilling program at the Nevada Packard and Rochester areas in 2011. This program, amounting to 74,215 feet (22,621 meters) of angled, reverse circulation and core drill holes, was focused on testing northern extensions of the main mineralized trends in the Nevada Packard and Rochester deposits. The Company has allocated $4.4 million for exploration in 2012 at the greater Rochester property. Chile  Other Properties The 2012 exploration budget for Chile is expected to be $1.1 million, consisting of identification and evaluation of potential new mining properties, supervision of exploration within Argentina and Chile, and the first phase of exploration on the Companys various exploration-stage properties in Chile. In 2010 the Company agreed to sell its wholly-owned Puchuldiza gold property in northern Chile for a total of $1.5 million cash, 500,000 shares of Southern Legacy Inc., and a 1.5% net smelter return royalty on future mineral production with a cap of $5.0 million. As of December 31, 2011, all cash payments had been made to the Company. Argentina  Martha Mine In 2011, the Companys exploration efforts at the Martha Mine consisted of 17,598 feet (5,364 meters) of core drilling in several locations around the mine and at the Companys Wendy target east-south of the mine. Argentina  Other Properties The Company also continued exploration in other parts of the Santa Cruz Province. Activities focused on the Joaquin, Tornado and Satélite properties. A total of 37,237 feet of drilling (11,350 meters) was completed on these three areas. Drilling at Joaquin during 2011 continued to return encouraging results on two targets: La Negra and La Morocha. Joaquin is located about 43 miles (70 kilometers) north of the Martha mine. Additional exploratory and definition drilling will continue in 2012 on this property. In 2010, the Company met its obligations, under its agreement with Mirasol Resources Ltd., to earn an initial 51% participating and managing equity interest in the 70,323 acre (109 square miles or 28,459 hectare) property. In 2011, the Company elected to proceed to increase its participating and managing equity interest to 61% by completing, at its sole cost, a feasibility study and the Company has a further option to increase its participating and managing equity interest to 71% subject to certain terms in its joint venture agreement with Mirasol. The Company has budgeted $9.6 million for exploration during 2012 in Argentina, $5.8 million is devoted to Joaquin. 40 Table of Contents Bolivia  San Bartolomé The Company has budgeted $0.4 million for follow-up trenching and sampling around San Bartolomé and for land holding costs. Samples from the planned program will be analyzed for both silver and tin. Africa, Tanzania During 2011 the company continued to wind-down its activities in Tanzania. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

As a result of this transaction, the Company realized a gain on the sale of approximately $25.5 million, net of income taxes, in 2009. (4) In August 2010, the Company sold its 100% interest in subsidiary Compañía Minera Cerro Bayo (Minera Cerro Bayo) to Mandalay Resources Corporation (Mandalay). Under the terms of the agree: (i) $6.0 million in cash; (ii) 17,857,143 common shares of Mandalay; (iii) 125,000 ounces of silver to be delivered in six equal quarterly installments commencing in the third quarter of 2011, which had an estimated fair value of $2.3 million; (iv) a 2.0% Net Smelter Royalty (NSR) on production from Minera Cerro Bayo in excess of a cumulative 50,000 ounces of gold and 5,000,000 ounces of silver, which had an estimated fair value of $5.4 million; and (v) existing value added taxes collected from the Chilean government in excess of $3.5 million. As part of the transaction, Mandalay agreed to pay the next $6.0 million of reclamation costs associated with Minera Cerro Bayos nearby Furioso property. Any reclamation costs above that amount will be shared equally by Mandalay and Coeur. The Company realized a loss on the sale of approximately $2.1 million, net of income taxes. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Coeur and its subsidiaries for the three years ended December 31, 2011. It consists of the following subsections:  Overview which provides a brief summary of the Companys financial position and the primary factors affecting those results.  Critical Accounting Policies which provides a discussion of the accounting policies Coeur considers critical because of their effect on the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and/or expenses in the Companys consolidated financial statements and/or because they require different objectives or complex judgments by management.  Operating statistics and ore reserve estimates which provides a summary of the consolidated production results for the three years ended December 31, 2011 and discussion of Coeurs reported ore reserves.  Results of operations which sets forth an analysis of the operating results for the last three years.  Liquidity and capital resources which contains a discussion of the Companys cash flows and liquidity, investing activities and financing activities, contractual obligations and environmental compliance expenditures.  Recently issued accounting pronouncements, which summarizes recently published authoritative accounting guidance, how it might apply to Coeur, and how it might affect the Companys future results. 45 Table of Contents Overview The Company is a large primary silver producer with growing gold production and has assets located in the United States, Mexico, Bolivia, Argentina and Australia. The Palmarejo mine, San Bartolomé mine, Kensington mine, Rochester mine, and Martha mine, each of which is operated by the Company, and the Endeavor mine, which is operated by a non-affiliated party, constituted the Companys principal sources of mining revenues during 2011. Coeur is an Idaho corporation incorporated in 1928. The Companys business strategy is to discover, acquire, develop and operate low-cost silver and gold operations that will produce long-term cash flow, provide opportunities for growth through continued exploration, and generate superior and sustainable returns for shareholders. The Companys management focuses on maximizing cash flow from its existing operations, the main elements of which are silver and gold prices, cash costs of production and capital expenditures. The Company also focuses on reducing its non-operating costs in order to maximize cashflow. The results of the Companys operations are significantly affected by fluctuation in prices of silver and gold, which may fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond its control, including interest rates, expectations regarding inflation, currency values, governmental decisions regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles, global and regional political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, The Company faces challenges including raising capital, increasing production and managing social, political and environmental issues. Operating costs at the Companys mines are subject to variation due to a number of factors such as changing commodity prices, ore grades, metallurgy, revisions to mine plans and changes in accounting principles. At foreign locations, operating costs are also influenced by currency fluctuations that may affect its U.S. dollar costs. Highlights during 2011:  Silver and gold prices averaged $35.34 per ounce and $1,572 per ounce in 2011, respectively. Silver reached a high of $48.55 per ounce on April 29, 2011 and a low of $26.77 per ounce on January 25, 2011. Gold reached a high of $1,895 per ounce on September 6, 2011 and a low of $1,319 per ounce on January 28, 2011.  The Company produced a total of 19.1 million ounces of silver during 2011, which was a 14% increase from 2010. The Company produced 220,382 ounces of gold during 2011, which was a 40% increase over 2010.  The Company experienced a 98% increase in metal sales to $1,021.2 million.  Net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 was $416.2 million, compared to $165.6 million in 2010.  The Company spent $120.0 million in capital expenditures, which represents a 23% decrease from 2010. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The information provided in this Form 10-K is based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these statements requires that the Company make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that it considers reasonable under the circumstances; however, reported results could differ from those based on the current estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management considers the policies discussed below to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the Companys consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect its results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The effects and associated risks of these policies on its business operations are discussed throughout this discussion and analysis. The areas requiring the use of managements estimates and assumptions relate to recoverable ounces from proven and probable reserves that are the basis of future cash flow estimates and units-of-production depreciation and amortization 46 Table of Contents calculations; useful lives utilized for depreciation, depletion, and long lived assets; estimates of recoverable gold and silver ounces in ore on leach pad; reclamation and remediation costs; valuation allowance for deferred tax assets; and post-employment and other employee benefit liabilities. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 3  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements included herein. Revenue Recognition. Revenue includes sales value received for the Companys principal product, silver, and associated by-product revenues from the sale of by-product metals by our silver producing properties, consisting primarily of gold. Revenue is recognized when title to silver and gold passes to the buyer and when collectability is reasonably assured. Title passes to the buyer based on terms of the sales contract. Product pricing is determined at the point revenue is recognized by reference to active and freely traded commodity markets, for example, the London Bullion Market for both gold and silver, in an identical form to the product sold. Under the Companys concentrate sales contracts with third-party smelters, final gold and silver prices are set on a specified future quotational period, typically one to three months, after the shipment date based on market metal prices. Revenues are recorded under these contracts at the time title passes to the buyer based on the forward price for the expected settlement period. The contracts, in general, provide for provisional payment based upon provisional assays and quoted metal prices. Final settlement is based on the average applicable price for the specified future quotational period and generally occurs from three to six months after shipment. Final sales are settled using smelter weights and settlement assays (average of assays exchanged and/or umpire assay results) and are priced as specified in the smelter contract. The Companys provisionally priced sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of concentrates at the forward price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting. The embedded derivative is recorded as a derivative asset in prepaid expenses and other assets or as a derivative liability in accrued liabilities and other on the balance sheet and is adjusted to fair value through revenue each period until the date of final gold and silver settlement. The form of the material being sold, after deduction for smelting and refining, is in an identical form to that sold on the London Bullion Market. The form of the product is metal in flotation concentrate, which is the final process for which the Company is responsible. The effects of forward sales contracts are reflected in revenue at the date the related precious metals are delivered. Third-party smelting and refining costs are recorded as a reduction of revenue. At December 31, 2011, the Company had outstanding provisionally priced sales of $22.5 million consisting of 0.2 million ounces of silver and 9,701 ounces of gold, which had a fair value of approximately $21.7 million including the embedded derivative. For each one cent per ounce change in realized silver price, revenue would vary (plus or minus) approximately $2,000 and for each one dollar per ounce change in realized gold price, revenue would vary (plus or minus) approximately $9,700. At December 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding provisionally priced sales of $35.7 million consisting of 0.6 million ounces of silver and 12,758 ounces of gold, which had a fair value of approximately $37.4 million including the embedded derivative. For each one cent per ounce change in realized silver price, revenue would vary (plus or minus) approximately $6,000 and for each one dollar per ounce change in realized gold price, revenue would vary (plus or minus) approximately $12,800. Reserve Estimates. The preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. The most critical accounting principles upon which the Companys financial status depends are those requiring estimates of recoverable ounces from proven and probable reserves and/or assumptions of future commodity prices. There are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves, including many factors beyond the Companys control. Ore reserve estimates are based upon engineering evaluations of samplings of drill holes and other openings. These estimates involve assumptions regarding future silver and gold prices, the geology of its mines, the mining methods it uses and the related costs it incurs to develop and mine its reserves. Changes in these assumptions could result in material adjustments to the Companys reserve estimates. The Company uses reserve estimates in determining the units-of-production depreciation and amortization expense, as well as in evaluating mine asset impairments. 47 Table of Contents Impairments. The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future cash flows or probability-weighted cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the assets, including property, plant and equipment, mineral property, development property, and any deferred costs. The accounting estimates related to impairment are critical accounting estimates because the future cash flows used to determine whether an impairment exists is dependent on reserve estimates and other assumptions, including silver and gold prices, production levels, and capital and reclamation costs, all of which are based on detailed engineering life-of-mine plans. Depreciation and Amortization. The Company depreciates its property, plant and equipment, mining properties and mine development using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the ore body based on its proven and probable recoverable reserves or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, whichever is shorter. The accounting estimates related to depreciation and amortization are critical accounting estimates because 1) the determination of reserves involves uncertainties with respect to the ultimate geology of its reserves and the assumptions used in determining the economic feasibility of mining those reserves and 2) changes in estimated proven and probable reserves and useful asset lives can have a material impact on net income. Ore on leach pad. The heap leach process is a process of extracting silver and gold by placing ore on an impermeable pad and applying a diluted cyanide solution that dissolves a portion of the contained silver and gold, which are then recovered in metallurgical processes. The Company uses several integrated steps to scientifically measure the metal content of ore placed on the leach pads. As the ore body is drilled in preparation for the blasting process, samples are taken of the drill residue which were assayed to determine estimated quantities of contained metal. The Company estimates the quantity of ore by utilizing global positioning satellite survey techniques. The Company then processes the ore through crushing facilities where the output is again weighed and sampled for assaying. A metallurgical reconciliation with the data collected from the mining operation is completed with appropriate adjustments made to previous estimates. The crushed ore is then transported to the leach pad for application of the leaching solution. As the leach solution is collected from the leach pads, it is continuously sampled for assaying. The quantity of leach solution is measured by flow meters throughout the leaching and precipitation process. After precipitation, the product is converted to doré, which is the final product produced by the mine. The inventory is stated at lower of cost or market, with cost being determined using a weighted average cost method. The Company reported ore on leach pad of $33.9 million as of December 31, 2011. Of this amount, $27.2 million is reported as a current asset and $6.7 million is reported as a non-current asset. The distinction between current and non-current is based upon the expected length of time necessary for the leaching process to remove the metals from the broken ore. The historical cost of the metal that is expected to be extracted within twelve months is classified as current and the historical cost of metals contained within the broken ore that will be extracted beyond twelve months is classified as non-current. Inventories of ore on leach pad are valued based on actual production costs incurred to produce and place ore on the leach pad, adjusted for effects on monthly production of costs of abnormal production levels, less costs allocated to minerals recovered through the leach process. The costs consist of those production activities occurring at the mine site and include the costs, including depreciation, associated with mining, crushing and precipitation circuits. In addition, refining is provided by a third-party refiner to place the metal extracted from the leach pad in a saleable form. These additional costs are considered in the valuation of inventory. The estimate of both the ultimate recovery expected over time and the quantity of metal that may be extracted relative to the time the leach process occurs requires the use of estimates which are inherently inaccurate since they rely upon laboratory testwork. Testwork consists of 60 day leach columns from which the Company projects metal recoveries up to five years in the future. The quantities of metal contained in the ore are estimated based upon actual weights and assay analysis. The rate at which the leach process extracts gold and silver from the crushed ore is based upon laboratory column tests and actual experience occurring over more than twenty years of leach pad operations at the Rochester mine. The assumptions used by the Company to measure metal content during each stage of the inventory conversion process includes estimated recovery rates based on laboratory testing and assaying. The Company periodically reviews its estimates compared to actual experience 48 Table of Contents and revises its estimates when appropriate. The Company believes its current residual heap leach activities are expected to continue through 2014. The ultimate recovery will not be known until leaching operations cease. The Company has estimated the number of ounces that are recoverable from the stage IV leach pad at December 31, 2011. If its estimate of ultimate recovery requires adjustment, the impact upon its valuation and upon its income statement would be as follows: Positive/NegativeChange in RecoverableSilver Ounces Positive/NegativeChange in RecoverableGold Ounces 5% 10% 15% 5% 10% 15% Quantity of recoverable ounces 69,040 138,081 207,121 236 473 709 Positive impact on future cost of production per silver equivalent ounce for increases in recoverable metal $ 0.38 $ 0.72 $ 1.05 $ 0.07 $ 0.14 $ 0.22 Negative impact on future cost of production per silver equivalent ounce for decreases in recoverable metal $ (0.41 ) $ (0.86 ) $ (1.35 ) $ (0.07 ) $ (0.15 ) $ (0.23 ) Reclamation and remediation costs. The Company recognizes obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. These legal obligations are associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and normal use of the asset. The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation will be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. An accretion cost, representing the increase over time in the present value of the liability, is recorded each period in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. As reclamation work is performed or liabilities are otherwise settled, the recorded amount of the liability is reduced. Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on managements best estimate at the end of each period of the undiscounted costs expected to be incurred at the site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care and maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Derivatives accounting. The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value. Changes in the value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in fair value adjustments, net. Income taxes. The Company computes income taxes using an asset and liability approach which results in the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences or benefits of temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. A valuation allowance has been provided for the portion of the Companys net deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has substantially concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters for years through 1999. Federal income tax returns for 2000 through 2010 are subject to examination. The Companys practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company had accrued $1.6 million in interest and penalties at December 31, 2011, related to an item under audit review in Bolivia. 49 Table of Contents Operating Statistics and Ore Reserve Estimates The Companys total production, excluding discontinued operations in 2011 was 19.1 million ounces of silver and 220,382 ounces of gold, compared to 16.8 million ounces of silver and 157,062 ounces of gold in 2010. Total estimated proven and probable reserves at December 31, 2011 were approximately 216.3 million ounces of silver and 2.3 million ounces of gold, compared to silver and gold ore reserves at December 31, 2010 of approximately 227.1 million ounces and 2.5 million ounces, respectively.

These measures are used in the mining industry and by the Companys management to measure, across periods, the net cash flow generated by mining operations. The Company cannot assure investors that other mining companies will calculate these measures in the same manner that the Company does. Production costs is the closest comparable U.S. GAAP measure for these measures. Accordingly, we have provided in the tables below a reconciliation of cash costs and cash operating costs to production costs. The corresponding per ounce measures can be calculated by dividing cash costs or cash operating costs, as applicable, by the number of ounces of silver or gold produced at the business unit. Cash costs reflect the direct and overhead cash costs arising from the physical activities involved in producing metal. These costs include the cost of mining, processing and other plant costs, third-party refining [and smelting costs], marketing expenses, on-site general and administrative royalties and mining production taxes, but net of by-product revenues earned from selling metals other than the primary metal produced by the business unit. Cash costs exclude certain amounts required to be included in production costs (which amounts can be substantial), including [third-party smelting costs, by-product credits, inventory adjustments and other non-cash charges].

The increase was primarily due to an increase in the quantity of silver and gold ounces sold and a higher realized price per ounce for both metals in 2011. The increased sale of gold ounces was primarily due to increased gold production at the Palmarejo mine and a full year of gold production at the Kensington mine. In 2011, the Company sold 19.1 million ounces of silver and 238,551 ounces of gold, compared to sales of 17.2 million ounces of silver and 130,142 ounces of gold in 2010 from continuing operations. In the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company realized average silver and gold prices of $35.15 per ounce and $1,558 per ounce, respectively, compared with realized average prices of $20.99 per ounce and $1,237 per ounce, respectively, in the prior year. Silver contributed 64.9% of sales as compared to 35.1% from gold. Included in revenues is by-product metal sales derived from the sale of gold by our silver producing properties. In 2011, by-product revenues totaled $207.4 million compared to $134.9 million in 2010. The Company believes that presentation of these revenue streams as by-products from its current operations will continue to be appropriate in the future. In the year ended December 31, 2011, the Companys continuing operations produced a total of 19.1 million ounces of silver and 220,382 ounces of gold compared to 16.8 million ounces of silver and 157,062 ounces of gold in 2010. The increase in silver production is primarily due to higher production levels at Palmarejo and San Bartolomé in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in gold production is primarily due to an increase in production at the Kensington mine with its first full year production of 88,420 ounces. Production costs applicable to sales from continuing operations for the year ended 2011 increased by $162.3 million, or 63.0%, from the same period of 2010 to $420.0 million. The increase in production costs applicable to sales for the year is primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of operating costs for the Kensington mine and higher production levels at Palmarejo and San Bartolomé. Depreciation and depletion increased in the year ended December 31, 2011 by $82.9 million, or 58.5%, over the prior year, primarily due to an increase in production at the Palmarejo mine and a full year of depreciation and depletion expense from the Kensington mine. Costs and Expenses Administrative and general expenses increased $7.2 million or 29.8% in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to severance related expenses connected to the departure of the Companys former President and Chief Executive Officer and share based compensation expense on cash settled awards. Exploration expenses increased by $4.9 million or 34.2% in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily as a result of increased exploration activity at and around the Companys existing properties.
