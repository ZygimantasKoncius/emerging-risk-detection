ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS AxocGens business involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond its control. The risk and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Set forth below is a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that management believes to be material to AxoGen. AxoGen has not experienced positive cash flow from its operations, and the ability to achieve positive cash flow from operations will depend on increasing sales of its products, which may not be achievable. AxoGen has historically operated with negative cash flow from its operations. As of December 31, 2011, AxoGen had an accumulated deficit of approximately $48 million. If AxoGen product sales do not increase as anticipated, then it will continue to experience negative cash flows and adverse operating conditions. As a result of AxoGens continuing capital needs and other factors, it is considering to raise additional funds in the next 12 months through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or from other sources. The sale of additional equity may result in dilution to AxoGens shareholders. There is no assurance that AxoGen will be able to secure funding on terms acceptable to it, or at all. AxoGens revenue growth depends on its ability to expand its sales force and develop new customers, and there can be no assurance that these efforts will result in significant increase in sales. AxoGen is in the process of investing in its sales channel composed of a combination of its direct sales force and independent distributors to allow it to reach new customers. There can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful in expanding AxoGens product sales. AxoGen currently sells products directly through its employees and indirectly through distributor relationships. AxoGen is engaged in a major initiative to build and further expand sales and marketing capabilities. The incurrence of these expenses impacts AxoGens operating results, and there can be no assurance of their effectiveness. If AxoGen is unable to develop its sales force and new customers, it may not be able to grow revenue or maintain its current level of revenue generation. AxoGens revenue depends solely on three products. All of AxoGens revenue is currently derived from only three products, the Avance® Nerve Graft, AxoGuard® Nerve Protector and AxoGuard® Nerve Connector, for the treatment of peripheral nerve damage. Its ability to generate revenue is dependent on the success of these products. Accordingly, any disruption in AxoGens ability to generate revenue from the sale of these products will have a material adverse impact on its business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects. In addition, AxoGens expenditures for research and development are minimal and funding to develop, or increase efforts to find collaboration or licensing opportunities to obtain, additional products will be necessary. The AxoGuard® products are only available through an exclusive distribution agreement with Cook Biotech Incorporated. Such contract is for a seven year initial term through August 2015, and renews automatically for an additional seven-year term, subject to agreement on future pricing. However, there are conditions for continuation of the agreement, including payment terms and minimum purchase requirements, that if breached could result in an earlier termination of the agreement; except that through mutual agreement the parties have not established such minimums and to date have not enforce such minimum purchase provision. Although there are products that AxoGen believes it could develop or obtain that would replace the AxoGuard® products, the loss of the ability to sell the AxoGuard® products could have a material adverse effect on AxoGens business until other replacement products are available. AxoGens success will be dependent on continued acceptance of its products by the medical community. Continued market acceptance of AxoGens products will depend on its ability to demonstrate that its products are an attractive alternative to existing nerve reconstruction treatment options. Its ability to do so will depend on surgeons evaluations of clinical safety, efficacy, ease of use, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of AxoGens nerve repair products. For example, although AxoGens Avance® Nerve Graft follows stringent safety 29 Table of Contents standards, including sterilization by gamma irradiation, AxoGen believes that a small portion of the medical community has lingering concerns over the risk of disease transmission through the use of allografts in general. Furthermore, AxoGen believes that even if its products receive general acceptance within the medical community, acceptance and clinical recommendations by influential surgeons will be important to the commercial success of AxoGens products. Negative publicity concerning methods of donating human tissue and screening of donated tissue, in the industry in which AxoGen operates, may reduce demand for its Avance® Nerve Graft product and negatively impact the supply of available donor tissue. AxoGen is highly dependent on its ability to recover cadaveric nerves from tissue donors for its Avance® Nerve Graft product. The availability of acceptable donors is relatively limited, and this availability is impacted by regulatory changes, general public opinion of the donation process and AxoGens reputation for its handling of the donation process. Media reports or other negative publicity concerning both improper methods of tissue recovery from donors and disease transmission from donated tissue for other allografts (i.e., bones, tendon, etc.) may limit widespread acceptance of AxoGens Avance® Nerve Graft allograft. Unfavorable reports of improper or illegal tissue recovery practices, both in the U.S. and internationally, as well as incidents of improperly processed tissue leading to transmission of disease, may broadly affect the rate of future tissue donation and market acceptance of allograft technologies. Potential patients may not be able to distinguish AxoGen products, technologies, and tissue recovery and processing procedures from others engaged in tissue recovery. In addition, families of potential donors from whom AxoGen is required to obtain consent before processing tissue may become reluctant to agree to donate tissue to for-profit tissue processors. Any disruption in the supply could have negative consequences for AxoGens revenue, operating results and continued operations AxoGen is highly dependent on the continued availability of its facilities and its relationship with its processor LifeNet Health and could be harmed if the facilities are unavailable for any prolonged period of time. Any failure in the physical infrastructure of AxoGens facilities, including the facility of its processor LifeNet Health, could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce its revenues and harm its business reputation and financial results. AxoGen is highly reliant on its relationship with LifeNet. In March 2012, AxoGen renewed its tissue processing agreement with LifeNet Health for a one-year term. The agreement renews automatically for additional one-year terms unless terminated. Either party may terminate the agreement during a renewal term with 180-day advanced written notice. Any natural or man-made event that impacts AxoGens ability to utilize these facilities could have a significant impact on its operating results, reputation and ability to continue operations. The regulatory process for approval of facilities is time-consuming and AxoGens ability to rebuild facilities would take a considerable amount of time and expense and cause a significant disruption in service to its customers. Although AxoGen has business interruption insurance which would in these instances, it may not cover all costs nor help to regain AxoGens standing in the market. AxoGen must maintain high quality manufacturing and processing. AxoGens Avance® Nerve Graft product requires careful calibration and precise, high-quality processing and manufacturing. Achieving precision and quality control requires skill and diligence by its personnel. If it fails to achieve and maintain these high quality controls, processing and manufacturing standards, including avoidance of manufacturing errors, defects or product failures, AxoGen could experience recalls or withdrawals of its product, delays in delivery, cost overruns or other problems that would adversely affect its business. AxoGen cannot completely eliminate the risk of errors, defects or failures. In addition, AxoGen may experience difficulties in scaling-up manufacturing of its Avance® product, including problems related to yields, quality control and assurance, tissue availability, adequacy of control policies and procedures, and lack of skilled personnel. If AxoGen is unable to process and produce its allografts on a timely basis, at acceptable quality and costs, and in sufficient quantities, or if it experiences unanticipated technological problems or delays in production, its business would be adversely affected. 30 Table of Contents AxoGen relies on third-party suppliers, some of which are currently the only source for the respective components or materials they supply to it. Although most of the raw materials used in the production of Avance® Nerve Graft are available from more than one supplier, AxoGen currently obtains one of the chemicals it uses in the manufacture of Avance® Nerve Graft from only one supplier. Some of the test results and reagents AxoGen uses in its manufacturing process are also obtained from single suppliers. FDA approval of a new supplier may be required if these materials become unavailable from AxoGens current suppliers. Although there may be other suppliers that have equivalent materials that would be available to AxoGen, FDA approval of any alternate suppliers if required could take several months or years to obtain, if able to be obtained at all. Any delay, interruption or cessation of production by AxoGens third-party suppliers of important materials, or any delay in qualifying new materials, if necessary, would prevent or delay AxoGens ability to manufacture products. In addition, an uncorrected impurity, a suppliers variation in a raw material or testing, either unknown to AxoGen or incompatible with its manufacturing process, or any other problem with AxoGens materials, testing or components, would prevent or delay its ability to manufacture products. These delays may limit AxoGens ability to meet demand for its products and delay its clinical trial, which would have a material adverse impact on its business, results of operations and financial condition. AxoGen relies on third parties to perform many necessary services for the commercialization of Avance® Nerve Graft, including services related to the recovery, distribution, storage and transportation. AxoGen relies upon third parties for certain recovery, distribution, and transportation services. In accordance with product specifications, these third parties ship Avance® Nerve Graft in specially validated shipping containers at frozen temperatures. If any of the third parties that AxoGen relies upon in its recovery, distribution, storage or transportation process fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to AxoGen, or encounter physical damage or natural disaster at their facilities, AxoGens ability to deliver product to meet commercial demand may be significantly impaired. AxoGen is dependent on its relationships with distributors to generate revenue. AxoGen derives material revenues through its relationships with distributors. If such distributor relationships were terminated for any reason, it could materially and adversely affect AxoGens ability to generate revenues and profits. AxoGen intends to obtain the assistance of additional distributors to continue its sales growth. It may not be able to find additional distributors who will agree to market and distribute its products on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If it is unable to establish new distribution relationships or renew current distribution agreements on commercially acceptable terms, operating results could suffer. Loss of key members of management, who it needs to succeed, could adversely affect its business. AxoGens future success depend on the continued efforts of the members of its senior management team. Competition for experienced management personnel in the healthcare industry is intense. If one or more of AxoGens senior executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, or if AxoGen is unable to attract and retain high quality senior executives or key personnel in the future, its business may be adversely affected. AxoGens operating results will be harmed if it is unable to effectively manage and sustain its future growth. There can be no assurance that AxoGen will be able to manage its future growth efficiently or profitably. Its business is unproven on a large scale and actual revenue and operating margins, or revenue and margin growth, may be less than expected. If AxoGen is unable to scale its production capabilities efficiently, it may fail to achieve expected operating margins, which would have a material and adverse effect on its operating results. Growth may also stress AxoGens ability to adequately manage its operations, quality of products, safety and 31 Table of Contents regulatory compliance. If growth significantly decreases AxoGens cash reserves, it may be required to obtain additional financing, which may increase indebtedness or result in dilution to shareholders. Further, there can be no assurance that AxoGen would be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms if all at. There may be significant fluctuations in AxoGens operating results. Significant quarterly fluctuations in AxoGens results of operations may be caused by, among other factors, its volume of revenues, seasonal changes in nerve repair activity, timing of sales force expansion and general economic conditions. There can be no assurance that the level of revenues and profits, if any, achieved by AxoGen in any particular fiscal period, will not be significantly lower than in other comparable fiscal periods. AxoGens expense levels are based, in part, on its expectations as to future revenues. As a result, if future revenues are below expectations, net income or loss may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenues, as any corresponding reduction in expenses may not be proportionate to the reduction in revenues. AxoGens revenues depend upon prompt and adequate reimbursement from public and private insurers and national health systems. Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the U.S. to fundamental change. The ability of hospitals to pay fees for AxoGens products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such materials and related treatments will continue to be available from governmental health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other organizations. Major third-party payers of hospital services and hospital outpatient services, including Medicare, Medicaid and private healthcare insurers, annually revise their payment methodologies, which can result in stricter standards for reimbursement of hospital charges for certain medical procedures or the elimination of reimbursement. Further, Medicare, Medicaid and private healthcare insurer cutbacks could create downward price pressure on AxoGens products. AxoGen may be subject to future product liability litigation that could be expensive and its insurance coverage may not be adequate. Although AxoGen is not currently subject to any product liability proceedings, and it has no reserves for product liability disbursements, it may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims in the future, including product liability claims arising out of the usage of AxoGen products. AxoGen currently carries product liability insurance in an amount consistent with industry averages, however, its insurance coverage and any reserves it may maintain in the future for product related liabilities may not be adequate and AxoGens business could suffer material adverse consequences. Technological change could reduce demand for AxoGens products. The medical technology industry is intensely competitive. AxoGen competes with both U.S. and international companies that engage in the development and production of medical technologies and processes including:  biotechnology, orthopedic, pharmaceutical, biomaterial, chemical and other companies;  academic and scientific institutions; and  public and private research organizations. AxoGen products compete with autograft and hollow-tube conduits, as well as with alternative medical procedures. For the foreseeable future, AxoGen believes a significant number of surgeons will continue to choose to perform autograft procedures when feasible, despite the necessity of performing a second operation and its drawbacks. In addition, many members of the medical community will continue to prefer the use of hollow-tube conduits due in part to their familiarity with these products and the procedures required for their use. Also, steady 32 Table of Contents improvements have been made in synthetic human tissue substitutes, which could compete with AxoGens products. Unlike allografts, synthetic tissue technologies are not dependent on the availability of human or animal tissue. Although AxoGens growth strategy contemplates the introduction of new technologies, the development of these technologies is a complex and uncertain process, requiring a high level of innovation, as well as the ability to accurately predict future technology and market trends. AxoGen may not be able to respond effectively to technological changes and emerging industry standards, or to successfully identify, develop or support new technologies or enhancements to existing products in a timely and cost-effective manner, if at all. Finally, there can be no assurance that in the future AxoGens competitors will not develop products that have superior performance or are less expensive relative to its products rendering them obsolete or noncompetitive. AxoGen may be unsuccessful in commercializing its products outside the U.S. To date, AxoGen has focused its commercialization efforts in the U.S., except for minor revenues from the Avance® Nerve Graft in Switzerland, Italy and Canada. It intends to expand sales beyond these countries outside the U.S. and will need to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, including obtaining the requisite approvals to do so. Additionally, AxoGen will need to either enter into distribution agreements with third parties or develop a direct sales force in these foreign markets. If it does not obtain adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payers outside of the U.S., it may be unable to develop and grow its product sales internationally. Outside of the U.S., reimbursement systems vary significantly by country. Many foreign markets have government-managed healthcare systems that govern reimbursement for medical devices and procedures. Additionally, some foreign reimbursement systems provide for limited payments in a given period and therefore result in extended payment periods. If AxoGen is unable to successfully commercialize its products internationally, its long term growth prospects may be limited. If AxoGen does not manage tissue and tissue donation in an effective and efficient manner, it could adversely affect its business. Many factors affect the supply, level and timing of donor medical releases, such as effectiveness of donor screening (currently performed by donor recovery groups), the effective recovery of tissue, the timely receipt, recording and review of required medical documentation, and employee loss and turnover in AxoGens and its contractors recovery department. AxoGen can provide no assurance that tissue recovery or donor medical releases will occur at levels that will maximize processing efficiency and minimize AxoGens cost per allograft processed. If AxoGen does not manage product inventory in an effective and efficient manner, it could adversely affect profitability. Many factors affect the efficient use and planning of product inventory, such as effectiveness of predicting demand, effectiveness of preparing manufacturing to meet demand, and efficiently meeting product mix and product demand requirements. AxoGen may be unable to manage its inventory efficiently, keep inventory within expected budget goals, keep its work-in-process inventory on hand or efficiently, or keep sufficient product on hand to meet demand, and AxoGen can provide no assurance that it can keep inventory costs within its target levels. Failing to do so may require AxoGen to raise additional cash resources or may harm long term growth prospects. AxoGen is a party to a loan agreement containing covenants that if breached could lead to a default and materially adversely affect it financial condition. AxoGen is party to the MidCap Loan (see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesLong-Term Debt) which contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, without limitation, (i) covenants requiring AxoGen to comply with applicable laws, provide to MidCap copies of AxoGens financial statements, maintain appropriate levels of 33 Table of Contents insurance and protect, defend and maintain the validity and enforceability of AxoGens material intellectual property, (ii) covenants restricting AxoGens ability to dispose of all or any part of its assets (subject to certain exceptions), engage in other lines of business, changes in its senior management, enter into merger or consolidation transactions, incur or assume additional indebtedness, or incur liens on its assets, and (iii) covenants requiring the Company to meet certain minimum Net Invoiced Revenue, as defined in the agreement, or maintain a cash balance of 80% of the loan principal amount. If AxoGen cannot meet any of the covenants, it would be deemed a default under the MidCap Loan, and the loan would become immediately due and payable. Such events would have a material adverse effect on AxoGen. There can be no assurance that AxoGen can meet the required covenants in (iii) above. To maintain minimum cash balance, AxoGen may need to raise additional capital, which could dilute the holdings of AxoGen shareholders and have a negative effect on AxoGens stock price. As a public company, AxoGen incurs costs to comply with relevant securities laws and regulations including, without limitation, the requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting. Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect AxoGens ability to report its results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner, and could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of AxoGens financial statements. As a public company, AxoGen incurs legal, accounting and other expenses to comply with relevant securities laws and regulations including, without limitation, the requirement of establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. AxoGens management devotes substantial time and financial resources to these compliance initiatives. Failure to comply with public company requirements could have a material adverse effect on AxoGens business. AxoGen identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting which pertains to inappropriately treating a contract as an expense as opposed to a prepaid asset during the fourth quarter of 2011. See Item 9AControls and ProceduresManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. While AxoGen has implemented remedial measures related to the identified material weakness, and will continue to review its disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting to ensure the quality of its financial reporting, it cannot guarantee that this material weakness has been fully remediated or that no future material weaknesses, significant deficiencies or other errors or omissions will be discovered. If AxoGen does not adequately remedy the material weakness, or if it fails to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in future periods, including any failure to implement or difficulty in implementing new or improved controls, its ability to provide timely and reliable financial results could suffer, and investors could lose confidence in its reported financial information. The price of AxoGens common stock could be highly volatile due to a number of factors. The trading price of AxoGens common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, including:  trading of AxoGen common stock on the OTCBB;  limited daily trading volume resulting in the lack of a liquid market;  fluctuations in price and volume due to investor speculation, internet message postings, and other factors that may not be tied to the financial performance by AxoGen;  performance by AxoGen in the execution of its business plan;  financial viability;  regulatory developments in both the United States and foreign countries;  performance of products sold and advertised by licensees in the marketplace;  economic and other external factors; and 34 Table of Contents  period-to-period fluctuations in financial results. AxoGen does not meet the criteria to list its common stock on an exchange such as the NYSEAMEX or NASDAQ Stock Market and its common stock lacks llliquidity and may be difficult to sell. Trading of AxoGens common stock is conducted on the OTCBB. Generally, securities that are quoted on the OTCBB lack liquidity and analyst coverage. This may result in lower prices for its common stock than might otherwise be obtained if it met the criteria to list its securities on a larger or more established exchange, such as the NYSEAMEX or NASDAQ Capital Market and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and asked prices for its common stock. In addition, there has been only limited trading activity in AxoGens common stock. The relatively small trading volume will likely make it difficult for AxoGen shareholders to sell their common stock as, and when, they choose. Risks Related to the Regulatory Environment in which AxoGen Operates AxoGens Avance® Nerve Graft product is currently allowed to be sold pursuant to a transition plan with the FDA and a change in position by the FDA regarding its use of enforcement discretion to permit the sale of Avance would have a material adverse effect on AxoGen. AxoGens Avance® Nerve Graft product is currently allowed to be sold pursuant to a transition plan with the FDA See BusinessGovernment RegulationsU.S. Government Regulation Review. AxoGen is continuing to communicate with CBER since the acceptance of the transition plan on clinical trial design and CMC for the Avance® Nerve Graft. Until final action on the Avance® Nerve Graft premarket submission, if AxoGen remains in compliance with the transition plan, it is able to continue to provide the Avance® Nerve Graft for sale. In the event that the FDA changed its position regarding its use of enforcement discretion to permit AxoGen to provide the Avance® Nerve Graft product in accordance with the transition plan, AxoGen would no longer be able to sell the Avance® Nerve Graft product, which would have a material adverse effect on the AxoGens operations and financial viability. In addition, if AxoGen fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or fails to comply with the ongoing requirements of the premarket submission to become a biological product, the FDA could deny approval of the premarket application, or impose civil penalties, including fines, product seizures or product recalls and, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. AxoGens AxoGuard® products are subject to FDA and other regulatory requirements. AxoGens AxoGuard® product line is regulated as a medical device under the FD&C Act and subject to 21 CFR Part 820 (Quality System Regulation) and other FDA regulations. AxoGen distributes for Cook Biotech Incorporated the AxoGuard® product line and Cook Biotech is responsible for the regulatory compliance of the AxoGuard® product line. Cook Biotech has obtained a 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA for porcine small intestine submucosa for the repair of peripheral nerve discontinuities where gap closure can be achieved by flexion of the extremity. If AxoGen or Cook Biotech Incorporated fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements the FDA could deny marketing clearance or approval, withdraw approvals, or impose civil penalties, including fines, product seizures or product recalls and, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. AxoGens business is subject to continuing regulatory compliance by the FDA and other authorities which is costly and could result in negative effects on its business. AxoGen is subject to extensive regulation. Its products are subject to regulation by the FDA in the U.S., the Center for Medicare Services of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other federal governmental agencies and, in some jurisdictions, by state and foreign governmental authorities. The FDA regulates the development, distribution, manufacturing, labeling, and record-keeping procedures for human tissue for transplantation such as that of AxoGens Avance® Nerve Graft product. The FDA also regulates medical devices, such as the AxoGuard® products. The process of obtaining marketing clearance from the FDA for new 35 Table of Contents products and new applications for existing products can be time consuming and expensive. Some of the future products and enhancements to such products that AxoGen expects to develop and market may require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA. There can be no assurance, however, that clearance or approval will be granted with respect to any of AxoGens products or enhancements or that FDA review will not involve delays that would adversely affect AxoGens ability to market such products or enhancements. In addition, there can be no assurance that AxoGen products or enhancements will not be subject to a lengthy and expensive approval process with the FDA. It is possible that if regulatory approvals to market a product are obtained from the FDA, the approvals may contain limitations on the indicated uses of such product. Other uses may be prohibited. Product approvals by the FDA can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval. Also, the FDA could limit or prevent the distribution of AxoGen products and has the power to require the recall of such products. FDA regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation, and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the FDA or other regulatory bodies will not adversely affect AxoGens operations. AxoGen, and its facilities, may be inspected by the FDA from time to time to determine whether it is in compliance with various regulations relating to specification, development, documentation, validation, testing, quality control, and product labeling. A determination that AxoGen is in violation of such regulations could lead to imposition of civil penalties, including fines, product recalls or product seizures and, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. The use, misuse or off-label use of AxoGens products may harm its reputation or the image of its products in the marketplace, or result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to AxoGens business or result in FDA sanctions if they are deemed to have engaged in off-label promotion. AxoGen is seeking FDA approval for Avance® Nerve Graft under specific circumstances. Its promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA requirements and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition on the promotion of a medical device for an indication that has not been approved or cleared by the FDA, or an off-label use. The FDA does not restrict or regulate a physicians use of a medical device within the practice of medicine, and AxoGen cannot prevent a physician from using its products for an off-label use. However, the FD&C Act and the FDAs regulations restrict the kind of communications that may be made about AxoGens products and if the FDA determines that its promotional or training materials constitute the unlawful promotion of an off-label use, it could request that AxoGen modify its training or promotional materials or subject it to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, civil money penalties, criminal fines and penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal health programs. Other federal, state or foreign governmental authorities might also take action if they consider AxoGen promotion or training materials to constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, AxoGens reputation could be damaged and the use of its products in the marketplace could be impaired. In addition, there may be increased risk of injury if physicians or others attempt to use AxoGen products off-label. Furthermore, the use of AxoGens product for indications other than those for which its products have been approved or cleared by the FDA may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm AxoGens reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients. Physicians may also misuse AxoGens product or use improper techniques if they are not adequately trained in the particular use, potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert managements attention from its primary business and result in substantial damage awards against AxoGen. Any of these events could harm AxoGens business, results of operations and financial condition. Defective AxoGen product could lead to recall or other negative business conditions. If AxoGens products are defective or otherwise pose safety risks, the FDA could require their recall, or AxoGen may initiate a voluntary recall of its products. The FDA may require recall of a marketed product in the event that it determines that due to material deficiencies or defects that use of the product poses an unacceptable risk to health. In addition, manufacturers may, on their own initiative, recall a product to remove or correct a deficiency 36 Table of Contents or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that may pose a risk to health. A government-mandated or a voluntary recall could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls, corrections or removals of any of AxoGens products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. A recall could harm AxoGens reputation with customers and negatively affect its sales. AxoGen may initiate removals involving some of its products in the future that it determines do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA were to disagree with AxoGens determinations, it could request that it report those actions as recalls, and take regulatory or enforcement action relating to the product. If AxoGens products cause or contribute to a death, a serious injury or any adverse reaction involving a communicable disease related to its products, or malfunction in certain ways, it will be subject to reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions. See BusinessRegulationEducation Grants, U.S. Anti-kickback, False Claims and Other Healthcare Fraud and Abuse LawsPervasive and Continuing Regulation. If AxoGen fails to report these events to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take regulatory or enforcement action against AxoGen. Any adverse event involving AxoGens products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection, mandatory recall or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as AxoGen defending itself in a lawsuit, would require the dedication of time and capital, distract management from operating its business, and may harm AxoGens reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. AxoGens manufacturing operations must comply with FDA and other governmental requirements. AxoGens manufacturing operations require it to comply with the FDAs and other governmental authorities laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and production of medical products, which is costly and could subject AxoGen to enforcement action. See BusinessGovernment RegulationsEducation Grants, U.S. Anti-kickback, False Claims and Other Healthcare Fraud and Abuse LawsPervasive and Continuing Regulation. Any of these actions could impair AxoGens ability to produce its products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet customer demands. AxoGen may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have an adverse impact on its future sales and its ability to generate profits. Furthermore, AxoGen key material suppliers, licensors and processor may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in AxoGens failure to produce its products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all. Sales of AxoGen products outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary from country to country. In the European Union (the EU) regulations, if applicable, differ from one EU member state to the next. Because of the absence of a harmonized regulatory framework and the proposed regulation for advanced therapy medicinal products in the EU, as well as for other countries, the approval process for human derived cell or tissue based medical products may be extensive, lengthy, expensive and unpredictable. AxoGen products will be subject to EU member states regulations that govern the donation, procurement, testing, coding, traceability, processing, preservation, storage, and distribution of human tissues and cells and cellular or tissue-based products. In addition, some EU member states have their own tissue banking regulations. The inability to meet foreign regulatory requirements could materially affect AxoGens future growth and compliance with such requirements could place a significant financial burden on AxoGen. Clinical trials can be long, expensive and ultimately uncertain which could jeopardize AxoGens ability to obtain regulatory approval and continue to market its Avance® Nerve Graft product. AxoGen is required to perform a clinical trial for its Avance® Nerve Graft pursuant to requirements of the FDA to obtain a biologics license for the product. This trial is expensive, is expected to take several years to execute, and is subject to factors within and outside of AxoGens control. The outcome of this trial is uncertain. 37 Table of Contents AxoGen has continued to communicate with FDA regarding clinical trial design, preclinical studies and CMC for the Avance® Nerve Graft, and will have significant work to continue to meet the requirements asked of AxoGen by the FDA for each of these components to begin its clinical study and receive its BLA. If AxoGen is unable to agree, or unable to meet the standards required of it by the FDA, regarding preclinical studies, clinical studies and CMC, AxoGens BLA may be impossible, delayed and/or may add significant costs to the ongoing production of Avance® Nerve Graft. The results of non-clinical studies do not necessarily predict future clinical trial results, and predecessor clinical trial results may not be repeated in subsequent clinical trials. Additionally, the FDA may disagree with AxoGens interpretation of the data from its non-clinical studies and clinical trials and may require it to pursue additional non-clinical studies or clinical trials, or not approve AxoGens BLA or supplement, which could further delay the BLA of AxoGens products. If AxoGen is unable to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of its products through its clinical trials, it will be unable to obtain regulatory approval to market its products and will not be able to continue to sell its Avance® Nerve Graft. AxoGen will rely on third parties to conduct its clinical trial and they may not perform as contractually required or expected. AxoGen will rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations (CROs), medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct its clinical trial and certain nonclinical studies. AxoGen and its CROs are required to comply with all applicable regulations governing clinical research, including good clinical practice (GCP). The FDA enforces these regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, CROs and trial sites. If AxoGen or its CROs fail to comply with applicable FDA regulations, the data generated in its clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require AxoGen to perform additional clinical trials before approving its applications. AxoGen cannot be certain that, upon inspection, the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities will determine that AxoGens clinical trial complies or complied with clinical trial regulations, including GCP. In addition, AxoGens clinical trial must be conducted with product produced under applicable current good manufacturing practice regulations. Failure to comply with the clinical trial regulations may require AxoGen to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if these third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to AxoGens clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, AxoGens non-clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and it would not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, its products on a timely basis, if at all, and its business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects would be adversely affected. Furthermore, AxoGens third-party clinical trial investigators may be delayed in conducting its clinical trials for reasons outside of their control. U.S. governmental regulation could restrict the use of AxoGens Avance® Nerve Graft product, restrict AxoGens procurement of tissue or increase costs. Human tissues intended for transplantation have been regulated by the FDA since 1993. In May 2005, three new comprehensive regulations went into effect that address manufacturing activities associated with HCT/Ps. The first requires that companies that produce and distribute HCT/Ps register with the FDA. The second provides criteria that must be met for donors to be eligible to donate tissues and is referred to as the Donor Eligibility rule. The third rule governs the processing and distribution of the tissues and is often referred to as the Current Good Tissue Practices rule. The Current Good Tissue Practices rule covers all stages of allograft processing, from procurement of tissue to distribution of final allografts. Together, they are designed to ensure that sound, high quality practices are followed to reduce the risk of tissue contamination and of communicable disease transmission to recipients. These regulations increased regulatory scrutiny within the industry in which AxoGen operates and have led to increased enforcement action, which affects the conduct of its business. See Business  Government Regulations. In addition, these regulations can increase the cost of tissue recovery activities. 38 Table of Contents Additionally, the Avance® Nerve Graft is subjected to certain state and local regulations, as well as compliance to the standards of the tissue bank industrys accrediting organization, the AATB. The procurement and transplantation of allograft nerve tissue is also subject to federal law pursuant to the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation, including nerve and related tissue, for valuable consideration. NOTA only permits reasonable payments associated with the removal, transportation, processing, preservation, quality control, implantation and storage of human nerve tissue. AxoGen makes payments to certain of its clients and tissue banks for their services related to recovering allograft nerve tissue on its behalf. If NOTA is interpreted or enforced in a manner which prevents AxoGen from receiving payment for services it renders, or which prevents it from paying tissue banks or certain of its clients for the services they render for AxoGen, its business could be materially and adversely affected. AxoGen is engaged, through its marketing employees, independent sales agents and sales representatives, in ongoing efforts designed to educate the medical community as to the benefits of AxoGen products, and AxoGen intends to continue it educational activities. Although AxoGen believes that NOTA permits payments in connection with these educational efforts as reasonable payments associated with the processing, transportation and implantation of AxoGen products, payments in connection with such education efforts are not exempt from NOTAs restrictions and AxoGens inability to make such payments in connection with its education efforts may prevent it from paying AxoGen sales representatives for their education efforts and could adversely affect AxoGens business and prospects. No federal agency or court has determined whether NOTA is, or will be, applicable to every allograft nerve tissue-based material which AxoGens processing technologies may generate. Assuming that NOTA applies to AxoGens processing of allograft nerve tissue, AxoGen believes that it complies with NOTA, but there can be no assurance that more restrictive interpretations of, or amendments to, NOTA will not be adopted in the future, which would call into question one or more aspects of AxoGens method of operations. Other regulatory entities include state agencies with statutes covering tissue banking. Regulations issued by Florida, New York, California and Maryland, among others, will be particularly relevant to AxoGens business. Most states do not currently have tissue banking regulations. However, incidents of allograft related infections in the industry may stimulate the development of regulation in other states. It is possible that others may make allegations against AxoGen or against donor recovery groups or tissue banks about non-compliance with applicable FDA regulations or other relevant statutes or regulations. Allegations like these could cause regulators or other authorities to take investigative or other action, or could cause negative publicity for AxoGens business and the industry in which it operates. Healthcare policy changes, including the recently enacted legislation to reform the U.S. healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on AxoGen. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, which substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and encourages improvements in the quality of healthcare items and services. This Act significantly impacts the biotechnology and medical device industries and could have a material adverse impact on numerous aspects of AxoGens business. This Act includes, among other things, the following measures:  a 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the U.S., with limited exceptions, beginning in 2013;  a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research;  new reporting and disclosure requirements on healthcare manufacturers for any transfer of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as reporting of certain physician 39 Table of Contents ownership interests, with the first of such reports due March 31, 2013 for calendar year 2012 (Sunshine Act);  payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models, beginning on or before January 1, 2013;  an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate; and  a new abbreviated pathway for the licensure of biologic products that are demonstrated to be biosimilar or interchangeable with a licensed biologic product. There are also a number of states (such as Vermont, Massachusetts, Minnesota) with their own Sunshine Acts that implement the reporting and disclosure requirements on healthcare manufacturers for any transfer of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as reporting of certain physician ownership interests, In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices AxoGen is able to charge for its products or the amounts of reimbursement available for its products and could also limit the acceptance and availability of its products. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on AxoGens business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where AxoGen does business. AxoGen could experience an adverse impact on operating results due to increased pricing pressure in the U.S. and in other markets. Governments, hospitals and other third-party payors could reduce the amount of approved reimbursement for AxoGens products or deny coverage altogether. Reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage or other cost-containment measures could unfavorably affect AxoGens future operating results. Risks Related to AxoGens Intellectual Property Failure to protect AxoGens Intellectual Property rights could result in costly and time consuming litigation and its loss of any potential competitive advantage. AxoGens success will depend, to a large extent, on its ability to successfully obtain and maintain patents, prevent misappropriation or infringement of IP, maintain trade secret protection, and conduct operations without violating or infringing on the IP rights of third parties. See Business  Intellectual Property. There can be no assurance that AxoGens patented and patent-pending technologies will provide it with a competitive advantage, that AxoGen will be able to develop or acquire additional technology that is patentable, or that third parties will not develop and offer technologies which are similar to AxoGens. Moreover, AxoGen can provide no assurance that confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants and other parties, trade secrecy agreements or similar agreements intended to protect unpatented technology will provide the intended protection. IP litigation is extremely expensive and time-consuming, and it is often difficult, if not impossible, to predict the outcome of such litigation. A failure by AxoGen to protect its IP could have a materially adverse effect on its business and operating results and its ability to successfully compete in its industry. Future protection for AxoGens proprietary rights is uncertain which may impact its ability to successfully compete in its industry. The degree of future protection for AxoGens proprietary rights is uncertain. AxoGen cannot ensure that:  it, or its licensors, were the first to make the inventions covered by each of AxoGens patents; 40 Table of Contents  it, or its licensors, were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;  others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of AxoGens technologies;  any of AxoGens pending patent applications will result in issued patents;  any of AxoGens issued patents or those of its licensors will be valid and enforceable;  any patents issued to AxoGen or its collaborators will provide any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;  it will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;  the patents of others will not have a material adverse effect on its business rights; or  the measures AxoGen relies on to protect its IP underlying their products may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using its technology, all of which could harm its ability to compete in the market. AxoGens success depends on its ability to avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties which could expose it to litigation or commercially unfavorable licensing arrangements. AxoGens commercial success depends in part on its ability and the ability of its collaborators and licensors to avoid infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may accuse AxoGen or collaborators and licensors of employing their proprietary technology in AxoGen products, or in the materials or processes used to research or develop AxoGen products, without authorization. Any legal action against AxoGen collaborators, licensors or it claiming damages and/or seeking to stop AxoGens commercial activities relating to the affected products, materials and processes could, in addition to subjecting AxoGen to potential liability for damages, require it or its collaborators and licensors to obtain a license to continue to utilize the affected materials or processes or to manufacture or market the affected products. AxoGen cannot predict whether AxoGen or its collaborators and licensors would prevail in any of these actions or whether any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If AxoGen were unable to obtain such a license, it and its collaborators and licensors may be unable to continue to utilize the affected materials or processes, or manufacture or market the affected products, or AxoGen may be obligated by a court to pay substantial royalties and/or other damages to the patent holder. Even if AxoGen were able to obtain such a license, the terms of such a license could substantially reduce the commercial value of the affected product or products and impair AxoGens prospects for profitability. Accordingly, AxoGen cannot predict whether or to what extent the commercial value of the affected product (or products) or AxoGens prospects for profitability may be harmed as a result of any of the liabilities discussed above. Furthermore, infringement and other IP claims, with or without merit, can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and can divert managements attention from its core business. AxoGen and its licensors may be unable to obtain and enforce IP rights to adequately protect its products and related IP. Others may claim an ownership interest in AxoGen IP which could expose it to litigation and have a significant adverse effect on its prospects. A third party may claim an ownership interest in one or more of AxoGens patents or other IP. A third party could bring legal actions against AxoGen claiming it infringes their patents or proprietary rights, and seek monetary damages and/or enjoin clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of the affected product or products. While AxoGen believes it owns the right, title and interest in the patents for which it or its licensors have applied and AxoGens other IP (including that which is licensed from third parties), and is presently unaware of any claims or assertions by third-parties with respect to AxoGens patents or IP, it cannot guarantee that a third-party will not assert a claim or an interest in any of such patents or IP. If AxoGen becomes involved in any litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of AxoGens resources, and cause a significant diversion of effort by AxoGens technical and management personnel regardless of the outcome of the litigation. If any of 41 Table of Contents these actions were successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, AxoGen could be required to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market the affected product, in which case AxoGen may be required to pay substantial royalties or grant cross-licenses to AxoGens patents. AxoGen cannot, however, assure you that any such license will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Ultimately, AxoGen could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of its business operations as a result of claims of patent infringement or violation of other IP rights, which could have a material and adverse effect on AxoGens business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, the outcome of IP litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance, including the demeanor and credibility of witnesses and the identity of the adverse party. This is especially true in IP cases that may turn on the testimony of experts as to technical facts upon which experts may reasonably disagree. AxoGen depends on maintenance of exclusive licenses. AxoGen depends fundamentally on keeping and satisfying the terms of exclusive licenses of its nerve repair technologies from UFRF and UTA where the original technologies are purported to be invented. Though AxoGen makes an effort to follow these agreements strictly, a disagreement between AxoGen and either party could have negative impacts on its ability to operate its business effectively. In addition, AxoGen could learn that the technologies it has licensed from UFRF and UTA do not perform as purported, are not efficacious, or are not the property of UFRF or UTA, or some similar problem with the license, any of which would have an immediate and negative impact on AxoGens business.
