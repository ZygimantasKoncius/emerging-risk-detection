Risk Factors Risks relating to our retail credit portfolio Future changes in market conditions as well as other factors may lead to increases in delinquency levels of our retail loan portfolio. For most of the recent past, consumer debt has increased significantly in Korea. Our portfolio of retail loans, including mortgage and home equity loans, grew from ￦98,996 billion as of December 31, 2010 to ￦103,855 billion as of December 31, 2011, although it decreased slightly to ￦103,432 billion as of December 31, 2012 but increased to ￦107,644 billion as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, our retail loans represented 48.5% of our total lending. Within our retail loan portfolio, the outstanding balance of other consumer loans, which unlike mortgage or home equity loans are often unsecured and therefore tend to carry a higher credit risk, has increased from ￦27,281 billion as of December 31, 2010 to ￦28,275 billion as of December 31, 2011, ￦28,969 billion as of December 31, 2012 and ￦29,675 billion as of December 31, 2013; as a percentage of total 11 Table of Contents outstanding retail loans, such balance has remained relatively stable at 27.6% as of December 31, 2010, 27.2% as of December 31, 2011, 28.0% as of December 31, 2012 and 27.6% as of December 31, 2013. The growth of our retail lending business, which generally offers higher margins than other lending activities, contributed significantly to our interest income and profitability in recent years. The growth of our retail loan portfolio, together with adverse economic conditions in Korea and globally in recent years, may lead to further increases in delinquency levels and a deterioration in asset quality. The amount of our non-performing retail loans (defined as those that are past due by 90 days or more) increased from ￦642 billion as of December 31, 2011 to ￦762 billion as of December 31, 2012 but decreased to ￦546 billion as of December 31, 2013. Higher delinquencies in our retail loan portfolio will require us to increase our loan loss provisions and charge-offs, which in turn will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our large exposure to consumer debt means that we are exposed to changes in economic conditions affecting Korean consumers. Accordingly, a rise in unemployment, an increase in interest rates, deterioration of the real estate market or difficulties in the Korean economy may have an adverse effect on Korean consumers, which could result in reduced growth and further deterioration in the credit quality of our retail loan portfolio. See Risks relating to KoreaUnfavorable financial and economic developments in Korea may have an adverse effect on us. In order to minimize our risk as a result of such exposure, we are continuing to strengthen our risk management processes, including further improving the retail lending process, upgrading our retail credit rating system, as well as strengthening the overall management of our portfolio. Despite our efforts, however, there is no assurance that we will be able to prevent significant credit quality deterioration in our retail loan portfolio. In light of adverse conditions in the Korean economy affecting consumers, in March 2009, the Financial Services Commission requested Korean banks, including us, to establish a pre-workout program, including a credit counseling and recovery service, for retail borrowers with outstanding short-term debt. Under the pre-workout program, which has been in operation since April 2009, maturity extensions and/or interest reductions are provided for retail borrowers with total loans of ￦1.5 billion or less (consisting of no more than ￦500 million of unsecured loans and ￦1 billion of secured loans) who are in arrears on their payments for more than 30 days but less than 90 days or for retail borrowers with an annual income of ￦40 million or less who have been in arrears on their payments for more than 30 days on an aggregate basis for the 12 months prior to their application. While we believe that our participation in such pre-workout program has not had a material impact on the overall credit quality of our retail loan and credit card portfolio or on our results of operations and financial condition to date, our future participation in such government-led initiatives to provide financial support to retail borrowers may lead us to offer credit terms for such borrowers that we would not otherwise offer, in the absence of such initiatives, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our credit card operations may generate losses in the future, which could hurt our financial condition and results of operations. With respect to our credit card portfolio, our delinquency ratio (which represents the ratio of amounts that are overdue by 30 days or more to total outstanding balances) increased from 1.0% as of December 31, 2010 to 1.5% as of December 31, 2011, then decreased to 1.3% as of December 31, 2012 but increased to 1.7% as of December 31, 2013. In line with industry practice, we have restructured a portion of delinquent credit card account balances (defined as balances overdue by 30 days or more) as loans. As of December 31, 2013, these restructured loans outstanding amounted to ￦50 billion. Because these loans are not treated as being delinquent at the time of conversion or for a period of time thereafter, our delinquency ratios may not fully reflect all delinquent amounts relating to our outstanding loans. Including all restructured loans, outstanding balances overdue by 30 days or more accounted for 2.1% of our credit card receivables (including credit card loans) as of December 31, 2013. Delinquencies may increase further in 2014 and in the future as a result of, among other things, adverse economic conditions in Korea and the inability of Korean consumers to manage increased household debt. 12 Table of Contents Despite our continuing efforts to sustain and improve our credit card asset quality and performance, we may experience increased delinquencies or deterioration of the asset quality of our credit card portfolio, which would require us to increase our loan loss provisions and charge-offs and adversely affect our overall financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in February 2014, the Financial Services Commission suspended the new credit card issuance and other related activities of our credit card subsidiary, KB Kookmin Card Co., Ltd., for three months from February to May 2014, in response to an incident involving the misappropriation of the personal information of a large number of its customers by an employee of an external credit information company in the first half of 2013. Specifically, during such suspension period, KB Kookmin Card will be prohibited from engaging in the following activities:  adding new subscribers for credit cards, prepaid cards and debit cards or issuing such types of cards (except as permitted by the chairman of the Financial Services Commission for public policy purposes);  providing new or additional credit lines to credit card customers; and  providing new services through mail order or telemarketing channels or related to travel or insurance products. Furthermore, in connection with the misappropriation incident, a number of customers have filed lawsuits against KB Kookmin Card seeking damages, and it could become subject to additional litigation and regulatory sanctions. See Item 8A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial InformationLegal Proceedings. KB Kookmin Card may also incur significant costs relating to the issuance of replacement cards for customers and the compensation of customers for losses incurred as a result of the fraudulent use of the misappropriated personal information. Accordingly, the misappropriation incident and the resulting regulatory sanctions (including the three-month suspension of KB Kookmin Cards new business activities), customer claims and costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Risks relating to our small- and medium-sized enterprise loan portfolio We have significant exposure to small- and medium-sized enterprises, and any financial difficulties experienced by these customers may result in a deterioration of our asset quality and have an adverse impact on us. One of our core businesses is lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises (as defined under Item 4.B. Business OverviewCorporate BankingSmall- and Medium-sized Enterprise Banking). Our loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises increased from ￦65,132 billion as of December 31, 2010 to ￦71,045 billion as of December 31, 2013. During that period, non-performing loans (defined as those loans that are past due by 90 days or more) to small- and medium-sized enterprises decreased from ￦686 billion as of December 31, 2010 to ￦373 billion as of December 31, 2011 but increased to ￦568 as of December 31, 2013, and the non-performing loan ratio for such loans decreased from 1.1% as of December 31, 2010 to 0.5% as of December 31, 2011 but increased to 0.8% as of December 31, 2013, and may further increase in 2014. According to data compiled by the Financial Supervisory Service, the delinquency ratio for Won-currency loans by Korean commercial banks to small- and medium-sized enterprises was 1.4% as of December 31, 2013. The delinquency ratio for loans to small- and medium-sized enterprise is calculated as the ratio of (1) the outstanding balance of such loans in respect of which either principal or interest payments are overdue by one month or more to (2) the aggregate outstanding balance of such loans. Our delinquency ratio for such Won currency loans has remained relatively stable at 1.1% as of December 31, 2010, 1.0% as of December 31, 2011, 1.1% as of December 31, 2012, and 0.9% as of December 31, 2013, but may increase in 2014. In recent years, we have taken measures which sought to stem rising delinquencies in our loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through strengthening 13 Table of Contents the review of loan applications and closer monitoring of the post-loan performance of small- and medium-sized enterprise borrowers in industry sectors that are relatively more sensitive to downturns in the economy and have shown higher delinquency ratios, such as construction, lodging, retail and wholesale, restaurants and real estate. Despite such efforts, however, there is no assurance that delinquency levels for our loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises will not rise in the future. In particular, financial difficulties experienced by small- and medium-sized enterprises as a result of, among other things, adverse economic conditions in Korea and globally in recent years may lead to a deterioration in the asset quality of our loans to this segment. Any such deterioration would result in increased charge-offs and higher provisioning and reduced interest and fee income from this segment, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, many small- and medium-sized enterprises have close business relationships with the largest Korean commercial conglomerates, known as chaebols, primarily as suppliers. Any difficulties encountered by those chaebols would likely hurt the liquidity and financial condition of related small- and medium-sized enterprises, including those to which we have exposure, also resulting in an impairment of their ability to repay loans. A substantial part of our small- and medium-sized enterprise lending comprises loans to small office/home office customers, or SOHOs. SOHOs, which we currently define to include sole proprietorships and individual business interests, are usually dependent on a limited number of suppliers or customers. SOHOs tend to be affected to a greater extent than larger corporate borrowers by fluctuations in the Korean economy. In addition, SOHOs often maintain less sophisticated financial records than other corporate borrowers. Although we continue to make efforts to improve our internally developed credit rating systems to rate potential borrowers, particularly with respect to SOHOs, and intend to manage our exposure to these borrowers closely in order to prevent any deterioration in the asset quality of our loans to this segment, we may not be able to do so as intended. In light of the deteriorating financial condition and liquidity position of small- and medium-sized enterprises in Korea since the global financial crisis commencing in the second half of 2008, the Korean government introduced policies and initiatives intended to encourage Korean banks to provide financial support to small- and medium-sized enterprises. For example, in November 2008, we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Financial Supervisory Service under which we were required to improve the liquidity position of small- and medium-sized enterprises and exporters by providing them with adequate financing and to endeavor to alleviate burdens on low-income debtors by extending maturity dates or by delaying interest payments on loans owed to us. In addition, in October 2008, the Financial Supervisory Service requested Korean banks, including us, to establish a fast track program to provide liquidity assistance to small- and medium-sized enterprises on an expedited basis. Under the fast track program we established, which has been extended until December 31, 2014, we provide liquidity assistance to qualified small- and medium-sized enterprise borrowers applying for such assistance, in the form of new loans or maturity extensions or interest rate adjustments with respect to existing loans, after expedited credit review and approval by us. The overall prospects for the Korean economy in 2014 and beyond remain uncertain, and the Korean government may extend or renew existing or past policies and initiatives or introduce new policies or initiatives to encourage Korean banks to provide financial support to small- and medium-sized enterprises. Our participation in such government-led initiatives may lead us to extend credit to small- and medium-sized enterprise borrowers that we would not otherwise extend, or offer terms for such credit that we would not otherwise offer, in the absence of such initiatives. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the financial condition and liquidity position of our small- and medium-sized enterprise borrowers benefiting from such initiatives will improve sufficiently for them to service their debt on a timely basis, or at all. Accordingly, increases in our exposure to small- and medium-sized enterprise borrowers resulting from such government-led initiatives may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 14 Table of Contents We have exposure to Korean construction and shipbuilding companies, and financial difficulties of these companies may have an adverse impact on us. As of December 31, 2013, we had loans outstanding to construction companies and shipbuilding companies (many of which are small- and medium-sized enterprises) in the amount of ￦4,297 billion and ￦714 billion, or 1.9% and 0.3% of our total loans, respectively. We also have other exposures to Korean construction and shipbuilding companies, including in the form of guarantees extended on behalf of such companies (which included ￦485 billion of confirmed guarantees for construction companies and ￦1,987 billion of confirmed guarantees for shipbuilding companies as of December 31, 2013) and debt and equity securities of such companies held by us. In the case of construction companies, such exposures include guarantees provided to us by general contractors with respect to financing extended by us for residential and commercial real estate development projects. In the case of shipbuilding companies, such exposures include refund guarantees extended by us on behalf of shipbuilding companies to cover their obligation to return a portion of the ship order contract amount to customers in the event of performance delays or defaults under shipbuilding contracts. The construction industry in Korea has experienced a downturn in recent years, due to excessive investment in residential property development projects, stagnation of real property prices and reduced demand for residential property, especially in areas outside of Seoul, including as a result of the deterioration of the Korean economy. The shipbuilding industry in Korea has also experienced a severe downturn in recent years due to a significant decrease in ship orders, primarily due to adverse conditions in the global economy and the resulting slowdown in global trade. In response to the deteriorating financial condition and liquidity position of borrowers in the construction and shipbuilding industries, which were disproportionately impacted by adverse economic developments in Korea and globally, the Korean government implemented a program in 2009 to promote expedited restructuring of such borrowers by their Korean creditor financial institutions, under the supervision of major commercial banks. In accordance with such program, 24 construction companies and five shipbuilding companies became subject to workout in 2009, following review by their creditor financial institutions (including us) and the Korean government. In addition, in June 2010, the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service announced that, following credit risk evaluations conducted by creditor financial institutions (including us) of companies in Korea with outstanding debt of ￦50 billion or more, 65 companies had been selected by such financial institutions for restructuring in the form of workout, liquidation or court receivership. Of such 65 companies, 16 were construction companies and three were shipbuilding companies. In July 2013, the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service announced the results of subsequent credit risk evaluations conducted by creditor financial institutions (including us) of companies in Korea, in which 40 companies with outstanding debt of ￦50 billion or more (20 of which were construction companies and three of which were shipbuilding and shipping companies) were selected by such financial institutions for restructuring in the form of workout, liquidation or court receivership. However, there is no assurance that these measures will be successful in stabilizing the Korean construction and shipbuilding industries. The allowances that we have established against our credit exposures to Korean construction and shipbuilding companies may not be sufficient to cover all future losses arising from these and other exposures. If the credit quality of our exposures to Korean construction and shipbuilding companies declines further, we may be required to take substantial additional provisions (including in connection with restructurings of such companies), which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, although a portion of our credit exposures to construction and shipbuilding companies are secured by collateral, such collateral may not be sufficient to cover uncollectible amounts in respect of such credit exposures. See Other risks relating to our businessA decline in the value of the collateral securing our loans and our inability to realize full collateral value may adversely affect our credit portfolio. We also have construction-related credit exposures under our project financing loans for real estate development projects in Korea. In light of the general deterioration in the asset quality of real estate project financing loans in Korea in recent years, Korean banks, including Kookmin Bank, implemented a uniform set of guidelines to apply more stringent criteria in evaluating the asset quality of real estate project financing loans. As a result, we may be required to establish additional allowances with respect to our outstanding real estate project financing loans, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 15 Table of Contents Risks relating to our financial holding company structure and strategy We may not succeed in implementing our strategy to take advantage of, or fail to realize the anticipated benefits of, our financial holding company structure. We were established as a new financial holding company in September 2008 pursuant to a comprehensive stock transfer under Korean law, following the completion of which Kookmin Bank, KB Investment & Securities Co., Ltd., KB Asset Management Co., Ltd., KB Real Estate Trust Co., Ltd., KB Investment Co., Ltd., KB Futures Co., Ltd., KB Credit Information Co., Ltd., and KB Data Systems Co., Ltd. became our wholly-owned subsidiaries. See Item 4.A. History and Development of the CompanyThe Establishment of KB Financial Group. In addition, as a part of our strategy to promote the growth of our credit card operations and enhance its synergies with our other businesses, we effected a horizontal spin-off of Kookmin Banks credit card business in March 2011. As a result, our credit card business is operated by a separate wholly-owned subsidiary, KB Kookmin Card Co., Ltd. One of our principal strategies is to take advantage of our financial holding company structure to become a comprehensive financial services provider capable of offering a full range of products and services to our large existing base of retail and corporate banking customers. The continued implementation of these plans may require additional investments of capital, infrastructure, human resources and management attention. This strategy entails certain risks, including the possibility that we may face significant competition from other financial holding companies and more specialized financial institutions in particular segments. If our strategy does not succeed, we may incur losses on our investments and our results of operations and financial condition may suffer. Furthermore, our success under a financial holding company structure depends on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies, growth opportunities and cost savings from coordinating the businesses of our various subsidiaries. Although we have been integrating certain aspects of our subsidiaries operations into our financial holding company structure, our subsidiaries will generally continue to operate as independent entities with separate management and staff and our ability to direct our subsidiaries day-to-day operations may be limited. For example, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the 2011 horizontal spin-off of the credit card business from Kookmin Bank into a new wholly-owned subsidiary, KB Kookmin Card Co., Ltd., due to various factors, including increased expenses arising from the operation of a separate credit card company, unexpected business disruptions, difficulties in reorganizing personnel and administrative functions and potential loss of customers. In addition, one of the intended benefits of our financial holding company structure is that it enhances our ability to engage in mergers and acquisitions which we decide to pursue in the future as part of our strategy. For example, we may consider acquiring or merging with a non-bank financial institution to achieve balanced growth and diversify our revenue base. The integration of our subsidiaries separate businesses and operations, as well as those of any companies we may acquire or merge with in the future, under our financial holding company structure could require a significant amount of time, financial resources and management attention. Moreover, that process could disrupt our operations (including our risk management operations) or information technology systems, reduce employee morale, produce unintended inconsistencies in our standards, controls, procedures or policies, and affect our relationships with customers and our ability to retain key personnel. The realization of the anticipated benefits of our financial holding company structure and any mergers or acquisitions we decide to pursue may be blocked, delayed or reduced as a result of many factors, some of which may be outside our control. These factors include:  difficulties in integrating the diverse activities and operations of our subsidiaries or any companies we may merge with or acquire, including risk management operations and information technology systems, personnel, policies and procedures;  difficulties in reorganizing or reducing overlapping personnel, branches, networks and administrative functions; 16 Table of Contents  restrictions under the Financial Holding Company Act and other regulations on transactions between a financial holding company and, or among, its subsidiaries;  unforeseen contingent risks, including lack of required capital resources, increased tax liabilities or restrictions in our overseas operations, relating to our financial holding company structure;  unexpected business disruptions;  failure to attract, develop and retain personnel with necessary expertise;  loss of customers; and  labor unrest. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of our financial holding company structure, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer as a result. We depend on limited forms of funding to fund our operations at the holding company level. We are a financial holding company with no significant assets other than the shares of our subsidiaries. Our primary sources of funding and liquidity are dividends from our subsidiaries, direct borrowings and issuances of equity or debt securities at the holding company level. In addition, as a financial holding company, we are required to meet certain minimum financial ratios under Korean law, including with respect to liquidity, leverage and capital adequacy. Our ability to meet our obligations to our direct creditors and employees and our other liquidity needs and regulatory requirements at the holding company level depends on timely and adequate distributions from our subsidiaries and our ability to sell our securities or obtain credit from our lenders. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us depends on their financial condition and operating results. In the future, our subsidiaries may enter into agreements, such as credit agreements with lenders or indentures relating to high-yield or subordinated debt instruments, that impose restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, and the terms of future obligations and the operation of Korean law could prevent our subsidiaries from making sufficient distributions to us to allow us to make payments on our outstanding obligations. See As a financial holding company, we depend on receiving dividends from our subsidiaries to pay dividends on our common stock. Any delay in receipt of or shortfall in payments to us from our subsidiaries could result in our inability to meet our liquidity needs and regulatory requirements, including minimum liquidity and capital adequacy ratios, and may disrupt our operations at the holding company level. In addition, creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have claims that are prior to any claims of our creditors with respect to their assets. Furthermore, our inability to sell our securities or obtain funds from our lenders on favorable terms, or at all, could also result in our inability to meet our liquidity needs and regulatory requirements and may disrupt our operations at the holding company level. As a financial holding company, we depend on receiving dividends from our subsidiaries to pay dividends on our common stock. Since our principal assets at the holding company level are the shares of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock largely depends on dividend payments from those subsidiaries. Those dividend payments are subject to the Korean Commercial Code, the Bank Act and regulatory limitations, generally based on capital levels and retained earnings, imposed by the various regulatory agencies with authority over those entities. For example:  under the Korean Commercial Code, dividends may only be paid out of distributable income, an amount which is calculated by subtracting the aggregate amount of a companys paid-in capital and certain mandatory legal reserves as well as certain unrealized profits from its net assets, in each case as of the end of the prior fiscal period; 17 Table of Contents  under the Bank Act, a bank also must credit at least 10% of its net profit to a legal reserve each time it pays dividends on distributable income until that reserve equals the amount of its total paid-in capital; and  under the Bank Act and the requirements of the Financial Services Commission, if a bank fails to meet its required capital adequacy ratio or otherwise becomes subject to management improvement measures imposed by the Financial Services Commission, then the Financial Services Commission may restrict the declaration and payment of dividends by that bank. Our subsidiaries may not continue to meet the applicable legal and regulatory requirements for the payment of dividends in the future. If they fail to do so, they may stop paying or reduce the amount of the dividends they pay to us, which would have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Although increasing our fee income is an important part of our strategy, we may not be able to do so. We have historically relied on interest income as our primary revenue source. While we have developed new sources of fee income as part of our business strategy, our ability to increase our fee income and thereby reduce our dependence on interest income will be affected by the extent to which our customers generally accept the concept of fee-based services. Historically, customers in Korea have generally been reluctant to pay fees in return for value-added financial services, and their continued reluctance to do so will adversely affect the implementation of our strategy to increase our fee income. Furthermore, the fees that we charge to customers are subject to regulation by Korean financial regulatory authorities, which may seek to implement regulations or measures that may also have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve this aspect of our strategy. We may suffer customer attrition or our net interest margin may decrease as a result of our competition strategy. We have been pursuing, and intend to continue to pursue, a strategy of maintaining or enhancing our margins where possible and avoid, to the extent possible, entering into price competition. In order to execute this strategy, we will need to maintain relatively low interest rates on our deposit products while charging relatively higher rates on loans. If other banks and financial institutions adopt a strategy of expanding market share through interest rate competition, we may suffer customer attrition due to rate sensitivity. In addition, we may in the future decide to compete to a greater extent based on interest rates, which could lead to a decrease in our net interest margins. Any future decline in our customer base or our net interest margins as a result of our future competition strategy could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Risks relating to competition Competition in the Korean financial industry is intense, and we may lose market share and experience declining margins as a result. Competition in the Korean financial industry has been and is likely to remain intense. Some of the financial institutions that we compete with have longer operating histories as financial holding companies, greater financial resources or more specialized capabilities than us and our subsidiaries. In the retail and small- and medium-sized enterprise lending business, which has been our traditional core business, competition has increased significantly and is expected to increase further. Most Korean banks have been focusing on retail customers and small- and medium-sized enterprises in recent years, although they have begun to generally increase their exposure to large corporate borrowers. In addition, the profitability of our retail and credit card operations may decline as a result of growing market saturation in the retail lending and credit card segments, increased interest rate competition, pressure to lower the fee rates applicable to our credit cards (particularly merchant fee rates) and higher marketing expenses. Intense and increasing competition has made and continues to make it more difficult for us to secure retail, credit card and small- and medium-sized customers with the credit quality and on credit terms necessary to achieve our business objectives in a commercially acceptable manner. 18 Table of Contents In addition, we believe that regulatory reforms and the general modernization of business practices in Korea will lead to increased competition among financial institutions in Korea. We also believe that foreign financial institutions, many of which have greater experience and resources than we do, will seek to compete with us in providing financial products and services either by themselves or in partnership with existing Korean financial institutions. Furthermore, a number of significant mergers and acquisitions in the industry have taken place in Korea over the past decade, including the acquisition of Koram Bank by an affiliate of Citibank in 2004, Standard Chartered Banks acquisition of Korea First Bank in 2005, Chohung Banks merger with Shinhan Bank in April 2006 and Hana Financial Groups acquisition of a controlling interest in Korea Exchange Bank in February 2012. We expect that consolidation in the financial industry will continue. In particular, the Korean government is in the process of disposing of or reducing its controlling interest in Woori Finance Holdings Co., Ltd. (the financial holding company of Woori Bank), which involves, in part, sales of its subsidiaries. Other financial institutions may seek to acquire or merge with such entities, and the financial institutions resulting from this consolidation may, by virtue of their increased size and business scope, provide significantly greater competition for us. Increased competition and continuing consolidation may lead to decreased margins, resulting in a material adverse impact on our future profitability. Accordingly our results of operations and financial condition may suffer as a result of increasing competition in the Korean financial industry. Risks relating to our large corporate loan portfolio We have exposure to chaebols, and, as a result, financial difficulties of chaebols may have an adverse impact on us. Of our 20 largest corporate exposures (including loans, debt and equity securities and guarantees and acceptances) as of December 31, 2013, 12 were to companies that were members of the 30 largest chaebols in Korea designated as such by the Financial Supervisory Service based on their outstanding exposures. As of that date, the total amount of our exposures to such 30 chaebols was ￦19,063 billion, or 6.9% of our total exposures. If the credit quality of our exposures to chaebols declines, we could require substantial additional loan loss provisions, which would hurt our results of operations and financial condition. See Item 4.B. Business OverviewAssets and LiabilitiesLoan PortfolioExposure to Chaebols. We cannot assure you that the allowances we have established against these exposures will be sufficient to cover all future losses arising from these exposures. In addition, with respect to those companies that are in or in the future enter into workout or liquidation proceedings, we may not be able to make any recoveries against such companies. We may, therefore, experience future losses with respect to those loans. We have exposure to companies that are currently or may in the future be put in restructuring, and we may suffer losses as a result of additional loan loss provisions required and/or the adoption of restructuring plans with which we do not agree. As of December 31, 2013, our loans and guarantees to companies that were in workout, restructuring or rehabilitation amounted to ￦1,026 billion or 0.4% of our total loans and guarantees, most of which was classified as impaired. As of the same date, our allowances for credit losses on these loans and guarantees amounted to ￦593 billion, or 57.8% of these loans and guarantees. These allowances may not be sufficient to cover all future losses arising from our exposure to these companies. Furthermore, we have other exposure to such companies, in the form of debt and equity securities of such companies held by us (including equity securities we acquired as a result of debt-to-equity conversions). Our exposures as of December 31, 2013 with respect to such securities of companies in workout, restructuring or rehabilitation amounted to ￦148 billion, or less than 0.3% of our total debt securities and equity securities, but may increase in the future. In addition, in the case of borrowers that are or become subject to workout, we may be forced to restructure our credits pursuant to restructuring plans approved by other creditor financial institutions of the borrower, or to dispose of our credits to other creditors on unfavorable terms. 19 Table of Contents We have exposure to member companies of the Kumho Asiana Group, and financial difficulties of these companies may adversely impact us. Several member companies of the Kumho Asiana Group, one of Koreas largest chaebols, have been experiencing financial difficulties, including as a result of their heavily leveraged acquisition of Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co., Ltd. in 2006 and the subsequent global financial crisis commencing in the second half of 2008. In January 2010, Kumho Tires Co., Inc. and Kumho Industrial Co., Ltd. agreed with their creditors, including us, to begin an out-of-court debt restructuring program under the Corporate Restructuring Promotion Act. In addition, Kumho Petrochemical Co., Ltd. and Asiana Airlines announced that they would undergo a voluntary restructuring, in return for which their creditors, including us, agreed to a suspension of payments on the two companies debt until the end of 2010. These four companies are member companies of the Kumho Asiana Group. In 2010, we converted an aggregate of ￦38 billion of our loans to Kumho Tires and ￦9 billion of our loans to Kumho Industrial into equity interests in connection with their restructuring programs. As of December 31, 2013, our aggregate loans and guarantees to Kumho Tires, Kumho Industrial, Kumho Petrochemical and Asiana Airlines amounted to ￦288 billion, ￦81 billion of which was classified as impaired. As of December 31, 2013, our allowances for credit losses with respect to such loans and guarantees amounted to ￦68 billion. Our allowances may not be sufficient to cover all future losses arising from our exposures to these companies. Furthermore, in the event that the financial condition of these companies deteriorates further in the future, we may be required to record additional provisions for credit losses, as well as charge-offs and valuation or impairment losses or losses on disposal, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A large portion of our credit exposure is concentrated in a relatively small number of large corporate borrowers which increases the risk of our corporate credit portfolio. As of December 31, 2013, our loans and guarantees to our 20 largest borrowers totaled ￦8,517 billion and accounted for 3.7% of our total loans and guarantees. As of that date, our single largest corporate credit exposure was to Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd., to which we had outstanding credit exposures (most of which was in the form of guarantees and acceptances) of ￦1,552 billion, representing 0.7% of our total loans and guarantees. Any further deterioration in the financial condition of our large corporate borrowers may require us to record substantial additional provisions and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Other risks relating to our business Difficult conditions in the global financial markets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. While the rate of deterioration of the global economy since the commencement of the global financial crisis in 2008 has slowed, with some signs of stabilization and improvement, the overall prospects for the Korean and global economy in the remainder of 2014 and beyond remain uncertain. Starting in the second half of 2011, the global financial markets have experienced significant volatility as a result of, among other things, the financial difficulties affecting many governments worldwide, in particular in Cyprus, Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal, and the slowdown of economic growth in major emerging market economies, as well as concerns regarding the potential economic impact of the recently commenced scale-down by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board of its quantitative easing stimulus program. In addition, continuing negotiations regarding Irans nuclear program and sanctions adopted by the international community in response, as well as political and social instability in various countries in the Middle East and Northern Africa, including in Syria, Egypt and Libya, have resulted in volatility and uncertainty in the global energy markets. Furthermore, in response to Chinas slowing gross domestic product growth rates that began in 2011, the Chinese government has implemented stimulus measures but the overall impact of such measures remains uncertain. In light of the high level of interdependence of the global economy, any of the foregoing developments could have a material adverse effect on the Korean economy and financial markets, and in turn on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 20 Table of Contents We are also exposed to adverse changes and volatility in global and Korean financial markets as a result of our liabilities and assets denominated in foreign currencies and our holdings of trading and investment securities, including structured products. The value of the Won relative to major foreign currencies in general and the U.S. dollar in particular has fluctuated widely in recent years. See Item 3.A. Selected Financial DataExchange Rates. A depreciation of the Won will increase our cost in Won of servicing our foreign currency-denominated debt, while continued exchange rate volatility may also result in foreign exchange losses for us. Furthermore, as a result of adverse global and Korean economic conditions, there has been significant volatility in securities prices, including the stock prices of Korean and foreign companies in which we hold an interest. Such volatility has resulted in and may lead to further trading and valuation losses on our trading and investment securities portfolio as well as impairment losses on our investments accounted for under the equity method, including our noncontrolling equity stake in JSC Bank CenterCredit, a Kazakhstan bank, the initial stake in which we acquired in 2008. See Item 4.B. Business OverviewCapital Markets Activities and International BankingInternational Banking. Our business may be materially and adversely affected by legal claims and regulatory actions against us. We are subject to the risk of legal claims and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our business, which may expose us to substantial monetary damages and legal costs, injunctive relief, criminal and civil penalties, sanctions against our management and employees and regulatory restrictions on our operations, as well as significant reputational harm. In particular, commencing in November 2013, Kookmin Bank has been subject to a number of investigations by the Financial Supervisory Service and other governmental authorities concerning alleged issues with Kookmin Banks internal controls and possible legal violations by Kookmin Bank and its employees.  In November 2013, Kookmin Bank filed a complaint against the former head and two former employees of its Tokyo Branch for allegedly extending illegal loans under borrowed names. The Financial Supervisory Service and the Financial Services Agency of Japan have each launched an investigation into the allegations.  The Financial Supervisory Service launched an investigation into alleged embezzlement of funds by employees at Kookmin Banks headquarters, who have since been suspended, through the presentation for payment of forged Korean government housing bonds.  At the request of the Financial Supervisory Service, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office commenced investigations into such alleged illegalities at Kookmin Bank. Kookmin Bank is cooperating with the ongoing investigations by the Financial Supervisory Service and other government authorities. Further investigations may be launched by governmental authorities or civil claims may be filed against Kookmin Bank with respect to the alleged legal violations by Kookmin Bank and its employees. Furthermore, in February 2014, the Financial Services Commission suspended the new credit card issuance and other related activities of KB Kookmin Card for three months from February to May 2014, in response to an incident involving the misappropriation of the personal information of a large number of its customers by an employee of the Korea Credit Bureau in the first half of 2013. In connection with the incident, a number of customers have filed lawsuits against KB Kookmin Card seeking damages, and it could become subject to additional litigation and regulatory sanctions. In addition, in connection with certain amendments to standard loan policy conditions for mortgage loan agreements that were instituted by the Korea Fair Trade Commission in January 2008 (which require banks to be responsible for the payment of mortgage registration expenses when issuing mortgage loans and which were upheld by the Supreme Court of Korea in August 2010), a number of Kookmin Banks customers have filed lawsuits in recent years seeking the return of mortgage registration expenses paid by such customers. See Item 8A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial InformationLegal Proceedings. 21 Table of Contents We are unable to predict the outcome of these and other investigations, lawsuits and regulatory actions, and the scope of investigations or the total amount in dispute in these matters may increase. Furthermore, adverse final determinations, decisions or resolutions in such matters could encourage other parties to bring related claims and actions against us. Accordingly, the outcome of current and future investigations, legal claims and regulatory actions, particularly those for which it is difficult to assess the maximum potential exposure or the ultimate adverse impact with any degree of certainty, may materially and adversely impact our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Our risk management system may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss. We seek to monitor and manage our risk exposure through a group-wide risk management platform, encompassing a multi-layered risk management governance structure, reporting and monitoring systems, early warning systems, a centralized credit risk management system for our banking operations and other risk management infrastructure, using a variety of risk management strategies and techniques. See Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. However, such risk management strategies and techniques employed by us and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate the economic and financial outcome in all market environments, and many of our risk management strategies and techniques have a basis in historic market behavior that may limit the effectiveness of such strategies and techniques in times of significant market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Furthermore, our risk management strategies may not be effective in a difficult or less liquid market environment, as other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies as us to deal with such market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for us to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants. We are generally subject to Korean corporate governance and disclosure standards, which may differ from those in other countries. Companies in Korea, including us, are subject to corporate governance standards applicable to Korean public companies which may differ in some respects from standards applicable in other countries, including the United States. As a reporting company registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, we are subject to certain corporate governance standards as mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, foreign private issuers, including us, are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. There may also be less publicly available information about Korean companies, such as us, than is regularly made available by public or non-public companies in other countries. Such differences in corporate governance standards and less public information could result in corporate governance practices or disclosures that are perceived as less than satisfactory by investors in certain countries. A decline in the value of the collateral securing our loans and our inability to realize full collateral value may adversely affect our credit portfolio. A substantial portion of our loans is secured by real estate, the values of which have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Although it is our general policy to lend up to 40% to 80% of the appraised value of collateral (except in areas of high speculation designated by the government where we generally limit our lending to between 40% to 60% of the appraised value of collateral) and to periodically re-appraise our collateral, the downturn in the real estate market in Korea in recent years has resulted in declines in the value of the collateral securing our mortgage and home equity loans. If collateral values decline further in the future, they may not be sufficient to cover uncollectible amounts in respect of our secured loans. Any future declines in the value of the real estate or other collateral securing our loans, or our inability to obtain additional collateral in the event of such declines, could result in a deterioration in our asset quality and may require us to take additional loan loss provisions. 22 Table of Contents In Korea, foreclosure on collateral generally requires a written petition to a court. An application, when made, may be subject to delays and administrative requirements that may result in a decrease in the value realized with respect to such collateral. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to realize the full value on our collateral as a result of, among other factors, delays in foreclosure proceedings and defects in the perfection of our security interest in collateral. Our failure to recover the expected value of collateral could expose us to losses. The secondary market for corporate bonds in Korea is not fully developed, and, as a result, we may not be able to realize the full marked-to-market value of debt securities we hold at the time of any sale of such securities. As of December 31, 2013, we held debt securities issued by Korean companies and financial institutions (other than those issued by government-owned or -controlled enterprises or financial institutions, which include Korea Electric Power Corporation, the Bank of Korea, Korea Development Bank, Korea Finance Corporation and Industrial Bank of Korea) with a total carrying amount of ￦18,596 billion in our trading and investment securities portfolio. The market value of these securities could decline significantly due to various factors, including future increases in interest rates or a deterioration in the financial and economic condition of any particular issuer or of Korea in general. Any of these factors individually or a combination of these factors would require us to write down the fair value of these debt securities, resulting in impairment losses. Because the secondary market for corporate bonds in Korea is not fully developed, the market value of many of these securities as reflected on our statements of financial position is determined by references to suggested prices posted by Korean rating agencies or the Korea Securities Dealers Association. These valuations, however, may differ significantly from the actual value that we could realize in the event we elect to sell these securities. As a result, we may not be able to realize the full marked-to-market value at the time of any such sale of these securities and thus may incur losses. We may be required to make transfers from our general banking operations to cover shortfalls in our guaranteed trust accounts, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We manage a number of money trust accounts through Kookmin Bank, our banking subsidiary. Under Korean law, trust account assets of a bank are required to be segregated from the assets of that banks general banking operations. Those assets are not available to satisfy the claims of a banks depositors or other creditors of its general banking operations. For some of the trust accounts we manage, we have guaranteed either the principal amount of the investors investment or the principal and a fixed rate of interest. If, at any time, the income from our guaranteed trust accounts is not sufficient to pay any guaranteed amount, we will have to cover the shortfall first from the special reserves maintained in these trust accounts, then from our fees from such trust accounts and finally from funds transferred from our general banking operations. As of December 31, 2013, we had ￦93 billion as special reserves in trust account assets for which we provided guarantees of principal. There was no transfer from general banking operations to cover deficiencies in guaranteed trust accounts in 2011, 2012 and 2013. However, we may be required to make transfers from our general banking operations to cover shortfalls, if any, in our guaranteed trust accounts in the future. Such transfers may adversely impact our results of operations. Our activities are subject to cybersecurity risk. Our activities have been, and will continue to be, subject to an increasing risk of cyber attacks, the nature of which is continually evolving. For example, many of our customers increasingly rely on our Internet banking services as well as our mobile and smartphone banking services for various types of transactions and, while such transactions are protected by encryption and other security programs, they are not free from security breaches. We have made substantial and continuous investments to build systems and defenses to address threats from cyber attacks and our monitoring and protection systems have been able to detect and respond to such breaches to date. However, we may experience security breaches or unexpected disruptions in connection with our services in the future, which may result in liability to our customers and third parties and have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations. 23 Table of Contents We may experience disruptions, delays and other difficulties from our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems for our daily operations including customer service, transactions, billing and record keeping. We may experience disruptions, delays or other difficulties from our information technology systems, which may have an adverse effect on our business and adversely impact our customers confidence in us. Risks relating to liquidity and capital management A considerable increase in interest rates could decrease the value of our debt securities portfolio and raise our funding costs while reducing loan demand and the repayment ability of our borrowers, which, as a result, could adversely affect us. Interest rates in Korea have been subject to significant fluctuations in recent years. In late 2008 and early 2009, the Bank of Korea reduced its policy rate by a total of 325 basis points to support Koreas economy amid the global financial crisis, and left such rate unchanged at 2.00% throughout 2009. In an effort to stem inflation amid improved growth prospects, the Bank of Korea gradually increased its policy rate in 2010 and 2011. However, the Bank of Korea reduced its policy rate to 3.00% in July 2012 and 2.75% in October 2012 and further reduced such rate to 2.50% in May 2013 to support Koreas economy in light of the recent slowdown in Koreas growth and uncertain global economic prospects. All else being equal, an increase in interest rates leads to a decline in the value of our portfolio of debt securities, which generally pay interest based on a fixed rate. A sustained increase in interest rates will also raise our funding costs, while reducing loan demand, especially among consumers. Rising interest rates may therefore require us to re-balance our asset portfolio and our liabilities in order to minimize the risk of potential mismatches and maintain our profitability. In addition, rising interest rate levels may adversely affect the Korean economy and the financial condition of our corporate and retail borrowers, including holders of our credit cards, which in turn may lead to a deterioration in our credit portfolio. Since most of our retail and corporate loans bear interest at rates that adjust periodically based on prevailing market rates, a sustained increase in interest rate levels will increase the interest costs of our retail and corporate borrowers and could adversely affect their ability to make payments on their outstanding loans. Our funding is highly dependent on short-term deposits, which dependence may adversely affect our operations. We meet a significant amount of our funding requirements through short-term funding sources, which consist primarily of customer deposits. As of December 31, 2013, approximately 94.9% of our deposits had maturities of one year or less or were payable on demand. In the past, a substantial proportion of our customer deposits have been rolled over upon maturity. We cannot guarantee, however, that depositors will continue to roll over their deposits in the future. In the event that a substantial number of our short-term deposit customers withdraw their funds or fail to roll over their deposits as higher-yielding investment opportunities emerge, our liquidity position could be adversely affected. We may also be required to seek more expensive sources of short-term and long-term funding to finance our operations. See Item 5.B. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesFinancial ConditionLiquidity. We may be required to raise additional capital if our capital adequacy ratio deteriorates or the applicable capital requirements change in the future, but we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all. Under the capital adequacy requirements of the Financial Services Commission, both we and Kookmin Bank, our banking subsidiary, are required to maintain a minimum Tier I common equity capital adequacy ratio of 4.0%, Tier I capital adequacy ratio of 5.5% and combined Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratio of 8.0%, on a consolidated basis from, January 1, 2014. As of December 31, 2013, our Tier I common equity capital, Tier I capital and combined Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios were 12.78%, 12.78% and 15.38%, respectively, 24 Table of Contents and Kookmin Banks Tier I common equity capital, Tier I capital and combined Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios were 12.61%, 12.61% and 15.42%, respectively, all of which exceeded the minimum levels required by the Financial Services Commission. However, our capital base and capital adequacy ratios may deteriorate in the future if our results of operations or financial condition deteriorates for any reason, including as a result of a deterioration in the asset quality of our retail loans (including credit card balances) and loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises, or if we are not able to deploy our funding into suitably low-risk assets. In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision introduced a new set of measures to supplement Basel II which include, among others, a requirement for higher minimum capital, introduction of a leverage ratio as a supplementary measure to the capital adequacy ratio and flexible capital requirements for different phases of the economic cycle. Additional details regarding such new measures, including an additional capital conservation buffer and counter-cyclical capital buffer, liquidity coverage ratio and other supplemental measures, were announced by the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in September 2010. After further impact assessment and observation periods, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision began phasing in the new set of measures, referred to as Basel III, starting from 2013. In May 2013, the Financial Services Commission announced that major Asian countries have already implemented Basel III in the first quarter of 2013 and that the proposed Basel III measures relating to stricter minimum capital ratio requirements will be implemented in Korea starting from December 1, 2013. In July 2013 and September 2013, the Financial Services Commission promulgated amended regulations implementing Basel III, pursuant to which Korean banks and bank holding companies were required to maintain a minimum ratio of Tier I common equity capital (which principally includes equity capital, capital surplus and retained earnings less reserve for credit losses) to risk-weighted assets of 3.5% and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% from December 1, 2013, which minimum ratios increased to 4.0% and 5.5%, respectively, from January 1, 2014 and will increase further to 4.5% and 6.0%, respectively, from January 1, 2015. Such requirements are in addition to the pre-existing requirement for a minimum ratio of Tier I and Tier II capital (less any capital deductions) to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, which remains unchanged. The amended regulations also contemplate an additional capital conservation buffer of 0.625% starting in 2016, with such buffer to increase in stages to 2.5% by 2019. The implementation of Basel III in Korea may have a significant effect on the capital requirements of Korean financial institutions, including us. See Item 4.B. Business OverviewSupervision and RegulationPrincipal Regulations Applicable to Financial Holding CompaniesCapital Adequacy and Principal Regulations Applicable to BanksCapital Adequacy. We may be required to obtain additional capital in the future in order to remain in compliance with more stringent capital adequacy and other regulatory requirements. However, we may not be able to obtain additional capital on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to obtain additional capital at any time may be constrained to the extent that banks or other financial institutions in Korea or from other Asian countries are seeking to raise capital at the same time. To the extent that we fail to comply with applicable capital adequacy ratio or other regulatory requirements in the future, Korean regulatory authorities may impose penalties on us ranging from a warning to suspension or revocation of our banking license. Risks relating to government regulation and policy The Korean government may promote lending and financial support by the Korean financial industry to certain types of borrowers as a matter of policy, which financial institutions, including us, may decide to follow. Through its policies and recommendations, the Korean government has promoted and, as a matter of policy, may continue to attempt to promote lending by the Korean financial industry to particular types of borrowers. For example, the Korean government has in the past provided and may continue to provide policy loans, which encourage lending to particular types of borrowers. It has generally done this by identifying sectors of the economy it wishes to promote and making low-interest funding available to financial institutions that may voluntarily choose to lend to these sectors. The government has in this manner provided policy loans intended to 25 Table of Contents promote mortgage lending to low-income individuals and lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises. All loans or credits we choose to make pursuant to these policy loans would be subject to review in accordance with our credit approval procedures. However, the availability of policy loans may influence us to lend to certain sectors or in a manner in which we otherwise would not in the absence of such loans from the government. In the past, the Korean government has also announced policies under which financial institutions in Korea are encouraged to provide financial support to particular sectors. For example, in light of the deteriorating financial condition and liquidity position of small- and medium-sized enterprises in Korea as a result of the global financial crisis commencing in the second half of 2008 and adverse conditions in the Korean economy affecting consumers, the Korean government introduced measures intended to encourage Korean banks to provide financial support to small- and medium-sized enterprise and retail borrowers. See Risks relating to our small- and medium-sized enterprise loan portfolioWe have significant exposure to small- and medium-sized enterprises, and any financial difficulties experienced by these customers may result in a deterioration of our asset quality and have an adverse impact on us. and Risks relating to our retail credit portfolioFuture changes in market conditions as well as other factors may lead to increases in delinquency levels of our retail loan portfolio. The Korean government may in the future request financial institutions in Korea, including us, to make investments in or provide other forms of financial support to particular sectors of the Korean economy as a matter of policy, which financial institutions, including us, may decide to accept. We may incur costs or losses as a result of providing such financial support. The Financial Services Commission may impose burdensome measures on us if it deems us or one of our subsidiaries to be financially unsound. If the Financial Services Commission deems our financial condition or the financial condition of our subsidiaries to be unsound, or if we or our subsidiaries fail to meet applicable regulatory standards, such as minimum capital adequacy and liquidity ratios, the Financial Services Commission may order or recommend, among other things:  capital increases or reductions;  stock cancellations or consolidations;  transfers of business;  sales of assets;  closures of subsidiaries or branch offices;  mergers with other financial institutions; and  suspensions of a part of our business operations. If any of these measures are imposed on us by the Financial Services Commission, they could hurt our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if the Financial Services Commission orders us to partially or completely reduce our capital, you may lose part or all of your investment. Risks relating to Korea Escalations in tensions with North Korea could have an adverse effect on us and the market price of our ADSs. Relations between Korea and North Korea have been tense throughout Koreas modern history. The level of tension between the two Koreas has fluctuated and may increase abruptly as a result of future events. In particular, since the death of Kim Jong-il in December 2011, there has been increased uncertainty with respect to the future of North Koreas political leadership and concern regarding its implications for political and economic stability in the region. Although Kim Jong-ils third son, Kim Jong-eun, has assumed power as his fathers designated successor, the long-term outcome of such leadership transition remains uncertain. 26 Table of Contents In addition, there have been heightened security concerns in recent years stemming from North Koreas nuclear weapon and long-range missile programs as well as its hostile military actions against Korea. Some of the significant incidents in recent years include the following:  In March 2013, North Korea stated that it had entered a state of war with Korea, declaring the 1953 armistice invalid, and put its artillery at the highest level of combat readiness to protest the Korea-United States allies military drills and additional sanctions imposed on North Korea for its missile and nuclear tests.  North Korea renounced its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in January 2003 and conducted three rounds of nuclear tests between October 2006 to February 2013, which increased tensions in the region and elicited strong objections worldwide. In response, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed resolutions that condemned North Korea for the nuclear tests and expanded sanctions against North Korea, most recently in March 2013.  In December 2012, North Korea launched a satellite into orbit using a long-range rocket, despite concerns in the international community that such a launch would be in violation of the agreement with the United States as well as United Nations Security Council resolutions that prohibit North Korea from conducting launches that use ballistic missile technology.  In March 2010, a Korean naval vessel was destroyed by an underwater explosion, killing many of the crewmen on board. The Korean government formally accused North Korea of causing the sinking, while North Korea denied responsibility. Moreover, in November 2010, North Korea fired more than one hundred artillery shells that hit Koreas Yeonpyeong Island near the Northern Limit Line, which acts as the de facto maritime boundary between Korea and North Korea on the west coast of the Korean peninsula, causing casualties and significant property damage. The Korean government condemned North Korea for the attack and vowed stern retaliation should there be further provocation. North Koreas economy also faces severe challenges. For example, in November 2009, the North Korean government redenominated its currency at a ratio of 100 to 1 as part of a currency reform undertaken in an attempt to control inflation and reduce income gaps. In tandem with the currency redenomination, the North Korean government banned the use or possession of foreign currency by its residents and closed down privately run markets, which led to severe inflation and food shortages. Such developments may further aggravate social and political tensions within North Korea. There can be no assurance that the level of tension on the Korean peninsula will not escalate in the future. Any further increase in tensions, which may occur, for example, if North Korea experiences a leadership crisis, high-level contacts between Korea and North Korea break down or military hostilities occur, could have a material adverse effect on the Korean economy and on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market value of our common stock and ADSs. Unfavorable financial and economic developments in Korea may have an adverse effect on us. We are incorporated in Korea, and substantially all of our operations are located in Korea. As a result, we are subject to political, economic, legal and regulatory risks specific to Korea. The economic indicators in Korea in recent years have shown mixed signs of growth and uncertainty, and future growth of the economy is subject to many factors beyond our control. In recent years, adverse conditions and volatility in the worldwide financial markets, fluctuations in oil and commodity prices and the general weakness of the U.S. and global economy have contributed to the uncertainty of global economic prospects in general and have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the Korean economy. See Other risks relating to our businessDifficult conditions in the global financial markets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The value of the Won relative to major foreign currencies in general and the U.S. dollar in particular has also fluctuated widely. See Item 3.A. Selected Financial DataExchange Rates. Furthermore, as a result of adverse global and Korean economic conditions, there has been significant volatility in the stock prices of Korean companies in recent years. Future declines in the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (known as the KOSPI) and large amounts of sales of Korean securities 27 Table of Contents by foreign investors and subsequent repatriation of the proceeds of such sales may adversely affect the value of the Won, the foreign currency reserves held by financial institutions in Korea, and the ability of Korean companies to raise capital. Any future deterioration of the Korean or global economy could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Developments that could hurt Koreas economy in the future include:  difficulties in the financial sectors in Europe and elsewhere and increased sovereign default risks in select countries and the resulting adverse effects on the global financial markets;  adverse changes or volatility in foreign currency reserve levels, commodity prices (including oil prices), exchange rates (including fluctuation of the U.S. dollar, the euro or the Japanese yen exchange rates or revaluation of the Chinese renminbi), interest rates, inflation rates or stock markets;  continuing adverse conditions in the economies of countries and regions that are important export markets for Korea, such as the United States, Europe, Japan and China, or in emerging market economies in Asia or elsewhere;  further decreases in the market prices of Korean real estate;  increasing delinquencies and credit defaults by retail or small- and medium-sized enterprise borrowers;  declines in consumer confidence and a slowdown in consumer spending;  increasing levels of household debt;  difficulties in the financial sector in Korea, including the savings bank sector;  the continued emergence of the Chinese economy, to the extent its benefits (such as increased exports to China) are outweighed by its costs (such as competition in export markets or for foreign investment and the relocation of the manufacturing base from Korea to China);  social and labor unrest;  a decrease in tax revenues and a substantial increase in the Korean governments expenditures for fiscal stimulus measures, unemployment compensation and other economic and social programs that, together, would lead to an increased government budget deficit;  financial problems or lack of progress in the restructuring of chaebols, other large troubled companies, their suppliers or the financial sector;  loss of investor confidence arising from corporate accounting irregularities and corporate governance issues concerning certain chaebols;  increases in social expenditures to support an aging population in Korea or decreases in economic productivity due to the declining population size in Korea;  the economic impact of any pending or future free trade agreements;  geo-political uncertainty and risk of further attacks by terrorist groups around the world;  natural disasters that have a significant adverse economic or other impact on Korea or its major trading partners;  the occurrence of severe health epidemics in Korea or other parts of the world;  deterioration in economic or diplomatic relations between Korea and its trading partners or allies, including deterioration resulting from territorial or trade disputes or disagreements in foreign policy;  political uncertainty or increasing strife among or within political parties in Korea;  hostilities or political or social tensions involving oil producing countries in the Middle East and North Africa and any material disruption in the global supply of oil or increase in the price of oil; 28 Table of Contents  an increase in the level of tensions or an outbreak of hostilities between North Korea and Korea or the United States; and  changes in financial regulations in Korea. Labor unrest in Korea may adversely affect our operations. Economic difficulties in Korea or increases in corporate reorganizations and bankruptcies could result in layoffs and higher unemployment. Such developments could lead to social unrest and substantially increase government expenditures for unemployment compensation and other costs for social programs. According to statistics from the Korea National Statistical Office, the unemployment rate was 3.4% in 2011, decreased to 3.2% in 2012 and decreased further to 3.1% in 2013. Future increases in unemployment and any resulting labor unrest in the future could adversely affect our operations, as well as the operations of many of our customers and their ability to repay their loans, and could adversely affect the financial condition of Korean companies in general, depressing the price of their securities. These developments would likely have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks relating to our common stock and ADSs We or our major stockholders may sell shares of our common stock or ADSs in the future, and these and other sales may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and ADSs and may dilute your investment and relative ownership in us. In September 2009, we issued 30,000,000 new shares of our common stock (including 2,775,585 new shares in the form of ADSs) at a subscription price of ￦37,250 per share (and US$29.95 per ADS), pursuant to a rights offering to our existing shareholders. In July 2011, Kookmin Bank, our wholly-owned subsidiary, sold 34,966,962 shares of our common stock in a block sale. We have no current plans for any subsequent public offerings of our common stock, ADSs or securities exchangeable for or convertible into such securities. However, it is possible that we may decide to offer or sell such securities in the future. In addition, our major stockholder, the Korean National Pension Service, held approximately 9.96% of our total issued common stock as of December 31, 2013, which it may sell at any time. Any future offerings or sales by us of our common stock or ADSs or securities exchangeable for or convertible into such securities, significant sales of our common stock by a major stockholder, or the public perception that an offering or sales may occur, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and ADSs. Furthermore, any offerings by us in the future of any such securities could have a dilutive impact on your investment and relative ownership interest in us. Ownership of our common stock is restricted under Korean law. Under the Financial Holding Company Act, a single stockholder, together with its affiliates, is generally prohibited from owning more than 10.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of voting stock of a bank holding company such as us that controls a nationwide bank, with the exception of certain stockholders that are non-financial business group companies, whose applicable limit has been reduced from 9.0% to 4.0% pursuant to an amendment of the Financial Holding Company Act which became effective from February 14, 2014. To the extent that the total number of shares of our common stock (including those represented by ADSs) that a holder and its affiliates own exceeds the applicable limits, that holder will not be entitled to exercise the voting rights for the excess shares, and the Financial Services Commission may order that holder to dispose of the excess shares within a period of up to six months. Failure to comply with such an order would result in an administrative fine of up to 0.03% of the book value of such shares per day until the date of disposal. Non-financial business group companies can no longer acquire more than 4.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of voting stock of a bank holding company pursuant to the amended Financial Holding Company Act, which grants an exception for non-financial business group companies which, at the time of the enactment of the amended provisions, held more 29 Table of Contents than 4.0% of the shares thereof with the approval of the Financial Services Commission before the amendment. See Item 4.B. Business OverviewSupervision and RegulationPrincipal Regulations Applicable to Financial Holding CompaniesRestrictions on Ownership of a Financial Holding Company. A holder of our ADSs may not be able to exercise dissent and appraisal rights unless it has withdrawn the underlying shares of our common stock and become our direct stockholder. In some limited circumstances, including the transfer of the whole or any significant part of our business and the merger or consolidation of us with another company, dissenting stockholders have the right to require us to purchase their shares under Korean law. However, holders of our ADSs will not be able to exercise such dissent and appraisal rights if the depositary refuses to do so on their behalf. Our deposit agreement does not require the depositary to take any action in respect of exercising dissent and appraisal rights. In such a situation, holders of our ADSs must withdraw the underlying common stock from the ADS facility (and incur charges relating to that withdrawal) and become our direct stockholder prior to the record date of the stockholders meeting at which the relevant transaction is to be approved, in order to exercise dissent and appraisal rights. A holder of our ADSs may be limited in its ability to deposit or withdraw common stock. Under the terms of our deposit agreement, holders of common stock may deposit such stock with the depositarys custodian in Korea and obtain ADSs, and holders of ADSs may surrender ADSs to the depositary and receive common stock. However, to the extent that a deposit of common stock exceeds the difference between: (1) the aggregate number of common shares we have deposited or we have consented to allow to be deposited for the issuance of ADSs (including deposits in connection with offerings of ADSs and stock dividends or other distributions relating to ADSs); and (2) the number of shares of common stock on deposit with the custodian for the benefit of the depositary at the time of such proposed deposit, such common stock will not be accepted for deposit unless (A) our consent with respect to such deposit has been obtained; or (B) such consent is no longer required under Korean laws and regulations. Under the terms of the deposit agreement, no consent is required if the shares of common stock are obtained through a dividend, free distribution, rights offering or reclassification of such stock. We have consented, under the terms of the deposit agreement, to any deposit to the extent that, after the deposit, the number of deposited shares does not exceed such number of shares as we determine from time to time (which number shall at no time be less than 100,000,000 shares), unless the deposit would be prohibited by applicable laws or violate our articles of incorporation. We might not consent to the deposit of any additional common stock. As a result, if a holder surrenders ADSs and withdraws common stock, it may not be able to deposit the stock again to obtain ADSs. A holder of our ADSs will not have preemptive rights in some circumstances. The Korean Commercial Code of 1962, as amended, and our articles of incorporation require us, with some exceptions, to offer stockholders the right to subscribe for new shares of our common stock in proportion to their existing shareholding ratio whenever new shares are issued. If we offer any rights to subscribe for additional shares of our common stock or any rights of any other nature, the depositary, after consultation with us, may make the rights available to holders of our ADSs or use reasonable efforts to dispose of the rights on behalf of such holders and make the net proceeds available to such holders. The depositary, however, is not required to make available to holders any rights to purchase any additional shares of our common stock unless it deems that doing so is lawful and feasible and:  a registration statement filed by us under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, is in effect with respect to those shares; or 30 Table of Contents  the offering and sale of those shares is exempt from or is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Similarly, holders of our common stock located in the United States may not exercise any such rights they receive absent registration or an exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act. We are under no obligation to file any registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective. Moreover, we may not be able to establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, a holder of our ADSs may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in its holdings. If a registration statement is required for a holder of our ADSs to exercise preemptive rights but is not filed by us or is not declared effective, the holder will not be able to exercise its preemptive rights for additional ADSs and it will suffer dilution of its equity interest in us. If the depositary is unable to sell rights that are not exercised or not distributed or if the sale is not lawful or feasible, it will allow the rights to lapse, in which case the holder will receive no value for these rights. Dividend payments and the amount a holder of our ADSs may realize upon a sale of its ADSs will be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Won. Our common stock is listed on the KRX KOSPI Market and quoted and traded in Won. Cash dividends, if any, in respect of the shares represented by the ADSs will be paid to the depositary in Won and then converted by the depositary into U.S. dollars, subject to certain conditions. Accordingly, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Won and the U.S. dollar will affect, among other things, the amounts a holder of our ADSs will receive from the depositary in respect of dividends, the U.S. dollar value of the proceeds that it would receive upon sale in Korea of the shares of our common stock obtained upon surrender of ADSs and the secondary market price of ADSs. Such fluctuations will also affect the U.S. dollar value of dividends and sales proceeds received by holders of our common stock. The market value of an investment in our ADSs may fluctuate due to the volatility of the Korean securities market. Our common stock is listed on the KRX KOSPI Market, which has a smaller market capitalization and is more volatile than the securities markets in the United States and many European countries. The market value of ADSs may fluctuate in response to the fluctuation of the trading price of shares of our common stock on the KRX KOSPI Market. The KRX KOSPI Market has experienced substantial fluctuations in the prices and volumes of sales of listed securities and the KRX KOSPI Market has prescribed a fixed range in which share prices are permitted to move on a daily basis. The KOSPI declined from 1,897.1 on December 31, 2007 to 938.8 on October 24, 2008. The KOSPI was 1,969.3 on April 28, 2014. There is no guarantee that the stock prices of Korean companies will not decline again in the future. Like other securities markets, including those in developed markets, the Korean securities market has experienced problems including market manipulation, insider trading and settlement failures. The recurrence of these or similar problems could have a material adverse effect on the market price and liquidity of the securities of Korean companies, including our common stock and ADSs, in both the domestic and the international markets. The Korean government has the potential ability to exert substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector business community, and in the past has exerted that influence from time to time. For example, the Korean government has promoted mergers to reduce what it considers excess capacity in a particular industry and has also encouraged private companies to publicly offer their securities. Similar actions in the future could have the effect of depressing or boosting the Korean securities market, whether or not intended to do so. Accordingly, actions by the government, or the perception that such actions are taking place, may take place or has ceased, may cause sudden movements in the market prices of the securities of Korean companies in the future, which may affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock and ADSs. 31 Table of Contents If the Korean government deems that emergency circumstances are likely to occur, it may restrict holders of our ADSs and the depositary from converting and remitting dividends and other amounts in U.S. dollars. If the Korean government deems that certain emergency circumstances, including, but not limited to, severe and sudden changes in domestic or overseas economic circumstances, extreme difficulty in stabilizing the balance of payments or implementing currency exchange rate and other macroeconomic policies, have occurred or are likely to occur, it may impose certain restrictions provided for under the Foreign Exchange Transaction Law, including the suspension of payments or requiring prior approval from governmental authorities for any transaction. See Item 10.D. Exchange ControlsGeneral. A holder of our ADSs may not be able to enforce a judgment of a foreign court against us. We are a corporation with limited liability organized under the laws of Korea. Substantially all of our directors and officers and other persons named in this document reside in Korea, and all or a significant portion of the assets of our directors and officers and other persons named in this document and substantially all of our assets are located in Korea. As a result, it may not be possible for holders of our ADSs to effect service of process within the United States, or to enforce against them or us in the United States judgments obtained in United States courts based on the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. There is doubt as to the enforceability in Korea, either in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of United States courts, of civil liabilities predicated on the United States federal securities laws.
