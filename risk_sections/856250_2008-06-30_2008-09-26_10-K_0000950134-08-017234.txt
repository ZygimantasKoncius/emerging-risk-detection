Item 1A. Risk Factors. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Companys management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Companys estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for the Companys conclusions. The Company continually evaluates the information used to make these estimates as its business and the economic environment changes. The Companys management believes that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on its financial statements, so the Company considers these to be its critical accounting policies. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized as product is shipped and related services are performed in accordance with all applicable revenue recognition criteria. For these transactions the Company applies the provisions of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Title generally transfers upon shipment of goods from the Companys warehouse. The Company does not have an obligation or policy of replacing customer products damaged or lost in transit. In some instances, the Company ships product directly from its suppliers to the customers. In these cases, the Company recognizes revenue when the product is accepted by the customers representative. For certain products, the Company offers preseason early-order programs that carry extended terms whereby customers may order and take delivery of products prior to the selling season. Products sold under preseason programs have no right of return. The Company applies the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent. The Companys application of EITF 99-19 includes evaluation of its terms with each major customer relative to a number of criteria that management considers in making its determination with respect to gross versus net reporting of revenue for transactions with its customers. Managements criteria for making these judgments place particular emphasis on determining the primary obligor in a transaction and which party bears general inventory risk. The Company records all shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenue, and related costs as cost of sales, when incurred, in accordance with EITF 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs. As part of its revenue recognition policy, the Company records an accrual of estimated incentives payable to its customers as a reduction of revenue at the time the related revenues are recorded. The Company bases its estimates on contractual terms of the programs and estimated or actual sales to individual customers. Actual incentives payable in any future period are inherently uncertain and, thus, may differ from its estimates. If actual or expected incentives were significantly greater than the reserves the Company had established, the Company would record a reduction to net revenues in the period in which the Company made such determination. In addition to various incentive programs, from time to time, the Company is required to provide mark-down funds to certain of its mass retail customers to assist them in clearing slow-moving inventory. These mark-down funds are accrued as a reduction of revenue at the time that the related revenues are recorded. 21 Table of Contents The Company is also required to provide for the cost of labor associated with resetting store displays. Resets involve removing slow-moving inventory and replacing it with new products. Although reset costs are paid to third parties who perform the services, they are considered an incentive to our mass merchandise customers. For existing products that are replaced, the Company accrues an estimate for the cost as in increase to cost of goods sold in advance of the reset at the time that the related revenues are recorded. The Company bases its estimates on a number of factors, including information obtained from our customers about their future plans. The cost for any new products or space that is gained is expensed as incurred as an increase to cost of goods sold. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company regularly analyzes significant customer balances, and, when it becomes evident a specific customer will be unable to meet its financial obligations to the Company, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position, a specific allowance for doubtful account is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount that is believed reasonably collectible. The Company also records allowances for doubtful accounts for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer and historical experiences. If circumstances related to specific customers change, estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted. Inventories The Companys inventories are primarily composed of finished goods and are recorded at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method. For inventory shipped out of the Woodard facility in Owosso, Michigan, inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined principally by the use of the standard cost method which approximates first-in, first-out (FIFO), or market. The Company provides estimated inventory allowances for excess, slow-moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value. These reserves are based on current assessments about future demands, market conditions and related management initiatives. If market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Goodwill The Company assesses the carrying values of goodwill annually or when circumstances dictate that the carrying value might be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is analyzed at the reporting unit level. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using discounted cash flow analysis. In the event that an impairment is determined to have occurred, the Company will reduce the carrying value of the asset in that period. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Companys financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, all expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax law or rates are considered. Deferred income taxes have been provided on unremitted earnings from foreign investees. The Company reviews its deferred tax assets for ultimate realization and will record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of these deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax authorities may not always agree with the tax positions taken by the Company. The Company believes it has adequate reserves in the event that a taxing authority differs with positions taken; however, there can be no assurance that the Companys results will not be affected adversely. See Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Variable Interest Entities Variable interest entities (VIEs) are primarily entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability. All VIEs with which the Company is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the VIE for financial reporting purposes. 22 Table of Contents The Company has a 50% ownership interest in Design Trends, a limited liability company. In connection with the adoption of FIN 46R, the Company concluded that Design Trends is a VIE and that the Company is the primary beneficiary. Pursuant to the provisions of FIN 46R, the Company consolidates Design Trends. Prior to the acquisition of Marketing Impressions, which became effective on July 1, 2006, the Company had a 50% ownership interest in PHI. The Company also concluded that PHI was a VIE and that the Company was the primary beneficiary. Pursuant to the provisions of FIN 46R, the Company consolidated PHI. Accordingly, the results of operations of PHI have historically been included in the consolidated income before minority interest of the Company. Prior to the acquisition, the minority interest in PHI income was excluded from the Companys consolidated net income. Since the effective date of the acquisition on July 1, 2006, no minority interest exists in PHI, and accordingly, the consolidated net income includes the full amount of PHI results from this date. Overview Management reviews a number of key indicators to evaluate the Companys financial performance, including net sales, gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses by segment. A condensed overview of results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, and the corresponding prior year period is summarized in the table that follows (in thousands, except percentage data). Fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 Income Statement by Segment (Dollars in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2008 June 30, 2007 Specialty Mass Total Specialty Mass Total Net sales $ 74,878 $ 62,712 $ 137,590 $ 59,925 $ 43,425 $ 103,350 Cost of goods sold (51,203 ) (51,474 ) (102,677 ) (38,745 ) (32,314 ) (71,059 ) Gross profit 23,675 11,238 34,913 21,180 11,111 32,291 Gross profit as a % of net sales 31.6 % 17.9 % 25.4 % 35.3 % 25.6 % 31.2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (19,539 ) (8,578 ) (28,117 ) (14,900 ) (6,251 ) (21,151 ) As a % of net sales 26.1 % 13.7 % 20.4 % 24.9 % 14.4 % 20.5 % Depreciation and amortization (600 ) (269 ) (869 ) (548 ) (251 ) (799 ) Total operating expenses (20,139 ) (8,847 ) (28,986 ) (15,448 ) (6,502 ) (21,950 ) Income from operations 3,536 2,391 5,927 5,732 4,609 10,341 Interest expense, net (1,495 ) 6 (1,489 ) (1,416 ) (25 ) (1,441 ) Other income (expenses) 140  140    Income before income taxes and minority interests 2,181 2,397 4,578 4,316 4,584 8,900 Provision for income taxes (797 ) (377 ) (1,174 ) (1,469 ) (13 ) (1,482 ) Income before minority interests 1,384 2,020 3,404 2,847 4,571 7,418 Minority interests  (1,292 ) (1,292 )  (1,507 ) (1,507 ) Net income $ 1,384 $ 728 $ 2,112 $ 2,847 $ 3,064 $ 5,911 Net Sales. Net sales for the Company increased $34,240,000 or 33.1% to $137,590,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to $103,350,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, primarily from the acquisition of the assets of Woodard, LLC, partially offset by declines in sales of ceiling fans, lighting and accessories sales. Net sales from the Specialty segment increased $14,953,000 or 25.0% to $74,878,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to $59,925,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, primarily from the acquisition of the assets of Woodard, LLC, as summarized in the following table. 23 Table of Contents Net Sales of Specialty Segment (Dollars in thousands) Fans Woodard Lighting & Outdoor Segment Fiscal Year Ended Accessories Furniture Total June 30, 2008 $ 50,768 $ 24,110 $ 74,878 June 30, 2007 59,925  59,925 Dollar increase (decrease) $ (9,157 ) $ 24,110 $ 14,953 Percent increase (decrease) (15.3 %) 100.0 % 25.0 % The sales of ceiling fans and lighting related products continue to be affected by the extremely weak overall housing market. Management continues to focus on introducing new lighting products, expanding Teiber accounts and developing new accounts for the Durocraft product lines to offset the weak housing market. Management believes that long-term growth will be favorably affected by additional product offerings through enhanced product development efforts, as well as selling outdoor furniture products to lighting showrooms and selling outdoor lighting and ceiling fans to patio dealers, and focusing efforts on the hospitality markets. Net sales of the Mass segment increased $19,287,000 or 44.4% to $62,712,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to $43,425,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, primarily from the acquisition of the net assets of Woodard, LLC, as summarized in the following table: Net Sales of Mass Segment (Dollars in thousands) Woodard Lighting & Outdoor Segment Fiscal Year Ended Accessories Furniture Total June 30, 2008 $ 31,461 $ 31,251 $ 62,712 June 30, 2007 43,425  43,425 Dollar increase (decrease) $ (11,964 ) $ 31,251 $ 19,287 Percent increase (decrease) (27.6 %) 100.0 % 44.4 % Sales of lighting products and ceiling fan accessories to the Mass segment are primarily from Craftmades Trade Source and Design Trends subsidiaries, both of which experienced declines in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease in net sales of Trade Source was primarily the result of: (i) a decline in orders from Lowes related to indoor lighting and outdoor lighting; (ii) lower sales of non-core drop shipped products; and (iii) lower sales of fan accessories. In November 2006, Lowes notified Trade Source that it will no longer source the 14 indoor and outdoor lighting SKUs previously sold by Trade Source to Lowes via direct import. The final shipments were shipped in during the third quarter of fiscal year 2007. Additional information is detailed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The decline in Design Trends net sales was primarily due to reduced retail sales of the mix and match portable lamp program through Lowes. Currently, Design Trends supplies mix and match portable lamps to all 13 Lowes regional distribution centers. Woodard sales were primarily composed of direct import sales to its various mass merchant customers. Most of its products are shipped directly from China. Due to the seasonal nature of outdoor furniture sales; most sales to mass merchants occur from January to April each year. 24 Table of Contents Based on the most recent annual line review, management believes that Lowes remains committed to the respective programs it currently has with the Company. Management believes that, based on the amount of product currently shipped to Lowes, Design Trends and PHI continue to be primary vendors for Lowes mix and match portable lamp and fan accessory/ceiling medallion programs, respectively. Management believes that the Company will continue to be invited to participate in each of Lowes scheduled line reviews for its existing and new product lines. The line reviews occur on an annual basis for each product category throughout the year and give us the potential to add new SKUs to the Lowes program. However, participation in line reviews could also result in a partial or complete reduction of either subsidiarys existing SKUs in the product lines currently offered to Lowes. Management believes that the future growth of the Mass segment is contingent upon the success of the Companys ongoing efforts to introduce new products, styles and marketing concepts to existing customers and the expansion of the business to new customers. Gross Profit. Gross profit of the Company as a percentage of net sales decreased 5.8% to 25.4% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to 31.2% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, primarily due to increased sales of Woodard products that carry a lower gross profit as compared to net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the Specialty segment decreased 3.7% to 31.6% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to 35.3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The decrease is summarized in the following table: Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales of Specialty Segment Fans Woodard Lighting & Outdoor Segment Fiscal Year Ended Accessories Furniture Total June 30, 2008 35.2 % 24.2 % 31.6 % June 30, 2007 35.3 %  35.3 % Percent decrease (0.1 %) na (3.7 %) For fiscal year 2008, gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the ceiling fan and lighting sales in the Specialty segment was only slightly down from the results generated in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, as the Specialty segment was able to offset the increases in cost of goods with a price increase that was effective April 15, 2008. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the Mass segment decreased 7.7% to 17.9% of net sales for the the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to 25.6% of net sales in the same prior year period, as summarized in the following table: Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales of Mass Segment Woodard Lighting & Outdoor Segment Fiscal Year Ended Accessories Furniture Total June 30, 2008 26.2 % 9.6 % 17.9 % June 30, 2007 25.6 %  25.6 % Percent increase/(decrease) 0.6 % na (7.7 %) Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for lighting products and ceiling fan accessories saw a slight overall increase as a result of changes in vendor programs. Woodard gross profit as a percent of net sales is low as all sales are direct import. For fiscal year 2009, gross profit as a percentage of net sales of lighting products and ceiling fan accessories is expected to remain consistent with the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, provided that the segment maintains a sales mix, customer concentration and level of vendor program commitment similar to that maintained during fiscal year 25 Table of Contents 2008. Management believes that the gross profit as a percentage of net sales for Woodard will show slight improvements over fiscal year 2008 as a result of selective price increases used to offset material costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses of the Company increased $6,966,000 to $28,117,000 or 20.4% of net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to $21,151,000 or 20.5% of net sales for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of certain assets of Woodard, LLC. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (Dollars in thousands) Increase/ Fiscal Year Ended (Decrease) June 30, June 30, Over Prior 2008 2007 Year Period Historical Craftmade $ 21,216 $ 21,151 $ 65 Woodard Incremental 6,901  6,901 $ 28,117 $ 21,151 $ 6,966 The historical Craftmade expenses were primarily impacted by lower variable costs and reductions in overhead largely offset by increases in group health insurance, consulting and legal fees, as summarized below: Historical Craftmade Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (Dollars in thousands) Increase/ Fiscal Year Ended (Decrease) June 30, June 30, Over Prior 2008 2007 Year Period Commissions $ 2,754 $ 3,326 $ (572 ) Bad Debt Expense 329 33 296 Accounting, legal and consulting 2,468 2,237 231 Health Insurance 1,102 789 313 Rent 246 393 (147 ) Other 14,317 14,373 (56 ) $ 21,216 $ 21,151 $ 65 The reduction in commissions expense is a variable cost driven by the decrease in net sales, while the increase in accounting, legal and consulting fees is primarily driven by costs associated with the search for a new chief executive officer. Health insurance expense was higher in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, as compared to the prior year due to increased claims. Management anticipates that based on current market conditions, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal year 2009 will be relatively consistent with results generated in fiscal year 2008. While management expects to capture some SG&A synergies in relation to the integration of the Woodard, LLC assets, due to continued pressure on sales these savings may not result in lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense of the Company increased $70,000 to $869,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to $799,000 for the same period last year. The increase resulted primarily from increased depreciation related to computer system upgrades. 26 Table of Contents Interest Expense. Net interest expense of the Company increased $48,000 to $1,489,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to $1,441,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Interest expense increased as a result of higher average outstanding debt balances stemming from the acquisition of certain net assets of Woodard, LLC, which was somewhat offset by lower average interest rates in effect as compared to the prior year. Other income. The Company realized a gain of $140,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, for leasing the oil and gas mineral rights at its principal place of business in Coppell, Texas. Minority interest. Minority interest expense decreased $215,000 to $1,292,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to $1,507,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The decrease in minority interest resulted from lower profits at Design Trends as a result of the decline in net sales. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income tax was $1,174,000 or 35.7% of net income before income taxes for fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to $1,507,000 or 20.0% of income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. See Note 5  Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding the Companys policy for determining the provision for income taxes. 27 Table of Contents Fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 compared to fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 Income Statement by Segment (Dollars in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2007 June 30, 2006 Specialty Mass Total Specialty Mass Total Net sales $ 59,925 $ 43,425 $ 103,350 $ 62,902 $ 55,152 $ 118,054 Cost of goods sold (38,745 ) (32,314 ) (71,059 ) (40,361 ) (42,224 ) (82,585 ) Gross profit 21,180 11,111 32,291 22,541 12,928 35,469 Gross profit as a % of net sales 35.3 % 25.6 % 31.2 % 35.8 % 23.4 % 30.0 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (14,900 ) (6,251 ) (21,151 ) (13,449 ) (6,446 ) (19,895 ) As a % of net sales 24.9 % 14.4 % 20.5 % 21.4 % 11.7 % 16.9 % Depreciation and amortization (548 ) (251 ) (799 ) (575 ) (19 ) (594 ) Total operating expenses (15,448 ) (6,502 ) (21,950 ) (14,024 ) (6,465 ) (20,489 ) Income from operations 5,732 4,609 10,341 8,517 6,463 14,980 Interest expense, net (1,416 ) (25 ) (1,441 ) (1,104 ) (80 ) (1,184 ) Other expenses    (35 ) 35  Income before income taxes and minority interests 4,316 4,584 8,900 7,378 6,418 13,796 Provision for income taxes (1,469 ) (13 ) (1,482 ) (2,501 ) (765 ) (3,266 ) Income before minority interests 2,847 4,571 7,418 4,877 5,653 10,530 Minority interests  (1,507 ) (1,507 )  (3,430 ) (3,430 ) Net income $ 2,847 $ 3,064 $ 5,911 $ 4,877 $ 2,223 $ 7,100 Net Sales. Net sales for the Company decreased $14,704,000 or 12.5% to $103,350,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to $118,054,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, primarily from a decline in net sales of the Mass segment. Net sales from the Specialty segment decreased $2,977,000 or 4.7% to $59,925,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, from $62,902,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. The decline was primarily due to a continued decrease in demand for decorative ceiling fans and Accolade lighting products as a result of the weak overall housing market. These decreases were partially offset by a 9.6% increase in net sales of Teiber product lines and an increase in net sales from the Durocraft product line consisting of clocks and weather gauges. Net sales of the Mass segment declined $11,727,000 or 21.3% to $43,425,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 from $55,152,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, as summarized in the following table: Net Sales of Mass Segment (Dollars in thousands) Trade Design Segment Fiscal Year Ended Source Trends Woodard Total June 30, 2007 $ 26,160 $ 17,265 $  $ 43,425 June 30, 2006 33,372 21,780  55,152 Dollar decrease $ (7,212 ) $ (4,515 ) $  $ (11,727 ) Percent decrease (21.6 %) (20.7 %) 0.0 % (21.3 %) The decrease in net sales of Trade Source was primarily the result of a decline in orders from Lowes related to indoor lighting, outdoor lighting and fan accessories. In November of 2006, Lowes notified Trade Source that it will no longer source the 14 indoor and outdoor lighting SKUs previously sold to Lowes via direct import. Management has been told that Lowes will be sourcing these products directly from various overseas manufacturers. Trade Source shipped all outstanding orders of discontinued products as of January 31, 2007. 28 Table of Contents The decline in Design Trends net sales was primarily due to the previously disclosed reduction of SKUs sold to Lowes in the seven of 11 regional distribution centers that Design Trends supplied. Beginning in April 2006, Design Trends began providing approximately 60% of the SKUs in the mix and match portable lamp display set marketed under Lowes private label as compared to 100% in prior periods. Management also believes that the decrease in net sales of Design Trends resulted from reduced demand due to economic conditions related to the housing industry. This decline in Design Trends was partially offset by an increase in net sales to four additional Lowes distribution centers. In November 2006, Design Trends began supplying a portion of its mix and match portable lamps to the four additional Lowes regional distribution centers that Design Trends had not been supplying since the quarter ended September 30, 2005. As a result, Design Trends supplies mix and match portable lamps to all 11 Lowes regional distribution centers. Gross Profit. Gross profit of the Company as a percentage of net sales increased 1.2% to 31.2% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to 30.0% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the Specialty segment of 35.3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was 0.5% lower than gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. An increase in net sales of product lines that carry a slightly lower gross profit as a percentage of net sales were offset by a non-recurring benefit obtained in the quarter ended March 31, 2006 from the recapture of duties related to prior periods as a result of an exemption of duties as prescribed by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). This non-recurring benefit totaled $255,000. The AJCA contains a provision that allowed ceiling fans for permanent installation to enter the U.S. duty-free between November 6, 2004 and December 31, 2006. The provision was recently extended through December 31, 2009. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the Mass segment increased 2.2% to 25.6% of net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to 23.4% of net sales in the same prior year period, as summarized in the following table: Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales of Mass Segment Trade Design Segment Fiscal Year Ended Source Trends Woodard Total June 30, 2007 25.6 % 25.5 % 0.0 % 25.6 % June 30, 2006 21.4 % 26.6 % 0.0 % 23.4 % Percent increase/(decrease) 4.2 % (1.1 %) 0.0 % 2.2 % Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased at Trade Source primarily due to the Companys acquisition of Marketing Impressions which allowed PHI to directly source certain of its fan accessory products. In addition, Trade Source benefited from lower costs associated with markdowns and product resets primarily as a result of the previously described loss of the indoor and outdoor lighting product orders by Lowes. On the other hand, Design Trends gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily as a result of higher amounts set aside for vendor programs with Lowes as compared to the prior fiscal year.

Total selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses of the Company increased $1,256,000 to $21,151,000 or 20.5% of net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to $19,895,000 or 16.9% of net sales for the prior fiscal year. 29 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (Dollars in thousands) Increase/ Fiscal Year (Decrease) June 30, June 30, Over Prior 2007 2006 Year Period Advertising $ 2,161 $ 1,514 $ 647 Salaries and wages 7,135 6,821 314 Accounting, legal and consulting 2,237 2,065 172 Other 9,618 9,495 123 $ 21,151 $ 19,895 $ 1,256 The increase in advertising expenses primarily resulted from (i) an investment in Teiber product displays to support the increase in Teiber net sales, (ii) an increase in direct marketing to support the cornice window treatment program and (iii) an increase in catalog expense as a result of a new product catalog for Craftmade that introduced new ceiling fans and other products. Increases in salaries and wages primarily resulted from increases in salaries of current employees to remain competitive with market conditions. Accounting, legal and consulting fees increased as a result of (i) consulting expense resulting from the acquisition of Marketing Impressions and (ii) increased legal and consulting fees from the Companys exploration of strategic alternatives. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense of the Company increased $205,000 to $799,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to $594,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. The increase resulted from depreciation and amortization of the fixed assets, non-compete covenants and intellectual property obtained by the Company as a result of the acquisition of Marketing Impressions. See Note 3  Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Interest Expense. Net interest expense of the Company increased $257,000 to $1,441,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 from $1,184,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. This increase was primarily the result of (i) higher interest rates in effect during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to the prior fiscal year and (ii) higher average outstanding balances on the Companys sources of debt as a result of cash used to fund the acquisition of Marketing Impressions and increases in inventory due to the transition of ceiling fan manufacturing from Taiwan to China. Minority Interests. Minority interests decreased $1,923,000 to $1,507,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to $3,430,000 for the previous fiscal year. The decrease in minority interests resulted from the acquisition of Marketing Impressions which increased the Companys effective ownership of PHI to 100% and eliminated minority interest in connection with PHI. The decrease in minority interests was also impacted by decreased profits at Design Trends as a result of the decline in net sales as previously discussed. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income tax was $1,482,000 or 20.0% of income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to $3,266,000 or 31.5% of income before taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. The decrease in effective rate primarily resulted from anticipated refunds from lower state apportionment rates applied to prior periods and a reduction in amounts set aside for tax contingencies. See Note 5  Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 The Companys cash increased $341,000 from $928,000 at June 30, 2007 to $1,269,000 at June 30, 2008. Net cash provided by the Companys operating activities increased $4,736,000 to $11,778,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to $7,042,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The increase in cash flow from operations resulted primarily from the timing of the Woodard acquisition and subsequent collection of working 30 Table of Contents capital after the acquisition date, and lower inventories and receivables due to lower sales of lighting and accessories, offset by the reduction in cash due to lower income from operations. The $16,851,000 of cash used in investing activities was primarily related to the acquisition of certain net assets of Woodard, LLC, and contingent payments related to the acquisition of Marketing Impressions. Cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from the cash borrowed to purchase certain assets of Woodard, LLC, offset by (i) cash dividends of $2,560,000, (ii) distributions to minority interest members totaling $1,225,000 and (iii) cash flow from operations that sweeps to the line of credit. The Companys management believes that its current lines of credit, combined with cash flows from operations will be adequate to fund the Companys current operating needs and debt service payments over the next 12 months. The Company is also exploring financing options related to the Owosso, Michigan facility, which could provide an additional source of liquidity. Management believes that the fair market value of this facility significantly exceeds its allocated cost. Management anticipates that future cash flows will be used primarily to retire existing debt, fund potential acquisitions or other investments that will enhance long-term stockholder value and distribute earnings to its minority interest member. The Company remains committed to its business strategy of creating long-term earnings growth, maximizing stockholder value through internal improvements, making selective acquisitions and dispositions of assets, focusing on cash flow and retaining quality personnel. Management believes that given the current volatility in the housing and debt markets, it is in the best interest of long-term stockholder value to continue to evaluate selective and opportunistic acquisitions. The strategy for such potential acquisitions would be to enhance the Companys product offerings and potentially expanding into adjacent product categories and sales channels that are less reliant on the overall housing environment. There can be no assurances, however, that any agreement will be reached or that any transaction will be consummated. Fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 The Companys cash decreased $1,236,000 from $2,164,000 at June 30, 2006 to $928,000 at June 30, 2007. Cash decreased as a result of the Company sweeping excess cash balances against its line of credit on a daily basis at PHI beginning in the quarter ended December 31, 2006, funds used to acquire Marketing Impressions and lower net income in fiscal 2007 as compared to prior fiscal years. Net cash provided by the Companys operating activities decreased $792,000 to $7,042,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to $7,834,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. The decrease in cash flow from operations resulted primarily from (a) lower net income, (b) lower accounts payable from the settlement of balances arising from the acquisition of Marketing Impressions and (c) a reduction in accrued customer allowances primarily from the loss of the indoor and outdoor lighting business with Lowes. These amounts were offset by lower accounts receivable and inventory balances driven in part by lower net sales in fiscal 2007. The $3,607,000 of cash used in investing activities was primarily related to the acquisition of Marketing Impressions and the ongoing upgrade of existing computer systems. Cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from (i) cash dividends of $2,498,000, (ii) distributions to minority interest members totaling $1,674,000 and (iii) principal payments on the Companys notes payable of $1,134,000. These amounts were offset by $671,000 of proceeds from our line of credit. Fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 The Companys cash decreased $6,981,000 from $9,145,000 at June 30, 2005 to $2,164,000 at June 30, 2006. Cash decreased as a result of the Company sweeping excess cash balances against its line of credit on a daily basis beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Net cash provided by the Companys operating activities increased $483,000 to $7,834,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, compared to $7,351,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. Increases in cash provided in various operating activities were partially offset by increased inventory balances at year end to support the increase in Teiber sales, window cornices, and increased levels of inventory in advance of sourcing products from different suppliers in Asia. 31 Table of Contents The $233,000 of cash used in investing activities related to additions to property and equipment, which consisted primarily of upgrading the Companys computer equipment. Cash used in financing activities of $14,582,000 was primarily the result (i) net payments on the Companys revolving lines of credit of $6,393,000, (ii) principal payments on the Companys notes payable of $1,513,000, (iii) distributions to minority interest members totaling $3,859,000, (iv) cash dividends of $2,404,000, and (v) a decrease in book overdrafts of $450,000. Net payments on the Companys primary revolving line of credit during fiscal year 2006 were higher than during fiscal year 2005 as a result of the Company sweeping excess cash balances against its line of credit on a daily basis and the use of cash during fiscal year 2005 in part to fund the acquisition of Teiber.
