Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to "Triangle," the "Company," "we," "us," "our," or "ours" refer to Triangle Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries. Our fiscal year end is January 31. The terms fiscal year 2015 ("FY2015"), fiscal year 2014 ("FY2014"), fiscal year 2013 ("FY2013"), and fiscal year 2012 ("FY2012") herein refer to the fiscal years ended January 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. ITEM 1. BUSINESS Company Overview We are a growth-oriented, independent energy holding company with three principal lines of business: oil and natural gas exploration, development and production; oilfield services; and midstream services. We conduct these activities in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana through the Company's two principal wholly-owned subsidiaries and our joint venture: Triangle USA Petroleum Company ("TUSA") conducts our exploration and production operations by acquiring and developing unconventional shale oil and natural gas resources; RockPile Energy Services, LLC ("RockPile") is a provider of hydraulic pressure pumping and complementary well completion and workover services; Caliber Midstream Partners, LP ("Caliber") is our 30% owned joint venture with First Reserve Energy Infrastructure Fund ("FREIF"). Caliber currently plans to provide freshwater delivery, produced water transportation and disposal, crude oil gathering and stabilization services, natural gas gathering and processing services. Our primary focus at TUSA is to grow our production volumes through the efficient development of our operated Bakken Shale and Three Forks drilling inventory. We completed our first operated well in May 2012. From May 2012 through January 31, 2014, we have completed 47 gross (34.5 net) operated wells. Our average net daily production for FY2014 was 5,286 Boepd, approximately 75% of which was operated production. The growth we have experienced is facilitated by the use of pad drilling, which increases efficiencies while controlling costs and minimizing environmental impact. We also use advanced completion, collection and production techniques designed to optimize reservoir production while reducing costs. Our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves as of January 31, 2014 totaled 40,314 Mboe (79% oil). In an effort to better control key operations, reduce costs, and retain supply chain value in the Williston Basin, which we view as a resource-constrained and cost-heavy basin, we formed RockPile and entered into our 30% owned joint venture arrangement with FREIF to form Caliber. RockPile's services lower our realized well completion costs, and RockPile affords us greater control over completion schedules, quality control and pay cycles. We expect that Caliber will reduce the cost and environmental impacts of trucking oil and water and reduce or eliminate the emissions generated by the flaring of produced natural gas from our operated wells. In addition to providing services to TUSA, RockPile and Caliber are focused on growing their respective businesses through securing independent, third-party contracts. Triangle has two reportable operating segments. Our exploration and production operating segment and our oilfield services operating segment are managed separately because of the nature of their products and services. The focus of the exploration and production operating segment is finding and producing oil and natural gas. The focus of the oilfield services operating segment is pressure pumping for both Triangle-operated wells and wells operated by third-parties. See Part II. Item 8. 10 Table of Contents Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 4Segment Reporting, for additional information on our segments. We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 11, 2003 under the name Peloton Resources Inc. On May 10, 2005, we changed our name to Triangle Petroleum Corporation. On November 30, 2012, we changed our state of incorporation from Nevada to Delaware. Strategies Our primary objective is to increase stockholder value by converting leasehold positions into proved reserves, production and cash flow at attractive returns on invested capital through a vertically integrated, low cost structure. To achieve these objectives we strive to: accelerate drilling, inventory and production growth in the Williston Basin; maximize efficiencies and lower costs within our operated units; improve cost structure and returns through vertical integration; continue to acquire assets and businesses at attractive costs that complement our current businesses; continue to focus leasehold efforts on converting non-operated acreage to operated acreage; and operate in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. Recent Events RockPile Credit Facility On March 25, 2014, RockPile entered into a Credit Agreement (the "FY2015 RockPile Credit Agreement") by and among RockPile, as borrower, Citibank, N.A. ("Citi"), as administrative agent and collateral agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo"), as joint lead arranger and joint book runner with Citi, and the other lenders party thereto. The FY2015 RockPile Credit Agreement provides for a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with an accordion feature that allows for the expansion of the facility up to $150.0 million. The credit facility is expected to support RockPile's growth initiatives and enable RockPile to remain self-funded as it contemplates additional investment in the infrastructure and equipment necessary to support broad-based growth across its service lines. A portion of the credit facility proceeds will be utilized to refinance RockPile's existing indebtedness. Neither Triangle nor its non-RockPile subsidiaries act as a guarantor under the FY2015 RockPile Credit Agreement. Summary of FY2014 Highlights During FY2014, we accomplished the following: Drilled and completed 27 gross (20.1 net) operated wells, a net well increase of 112% versus FY2013; Increased average daily production by approximately 295% year-over-year to 5,286 Boepd; Increased proved reserves from approximately 14,637 Mboe at January 31, 2013 to 40,314 Mboe at January 31, 2014, an increase of approximately 175% year-over-year; Generated total revenues of $258.7 million, an increase of 326% from FY2013; Revenues from oil and gas sales increased from $39.6 million in FY2013 to $160.5 million in FY2014; 11 Table of Contents Consolidated revenues from oilfield services increased from $20.7 million in FY2013 to $98.2 million in FY2014; Increased net income attributable to common stockholders to $73.5 million for FY2014, or $0.91 per diluted share, an increase of $87.2 million from FY2013; Generated cash flow from operating activities of $85.6 million; Increased operated DSUs from 92 in FY2013, including 33 in our core area, to 101 in FY2014, including 42 in our core area; RockPile completed 31 TUSA wells and 50 third-party wells, as compared to 12 TUSA wells and 5 third party wells in FY2013; RockPile deployed into service a second hydraulic fracturing spread and its first wireline unit; RockPile acquired Team Well Service, Inc., an operator of well service rigs in North Dakota; Connected 31 new wells to the Caliber midstream system; and Caliber closed a currently undrawn $200.0 million credit facility secured only by Caliber's assets (no Triangle or FREIF guaranty). Exploration, Development and Production Williston BasinUnited States As of January 31, 2014, we held leasehold interests in approximately 94,000 net acres in the Williston Basin. Approximately 45,000 net acres are located in our core focus area in McKenzie and Williams Counties, North Dakota, which we refer to as our "Core Acreage." Our Core Acreage has high oil saturation, is slightly over-pressured, and has the potential for multiple benches. We operate approximately 30,000 net acres in our Core Acreage. We also hold approximately 49,000 net acres in the Station Prospect located in Sheridan and Roosevelt Counties, Montana, of which we operate approximately 33,000 net acres. The majority of our Williston Basin leaseholds are held primarily under fee leases. These leases typically carry a primary term of three to five years with landowner royalties of approximately 16% to 20%. In most cases, we obtain "paid-up" fee leases, which do not require annual delay rentals. As of January 31, 2014, we have completed a total of 47 gross (34.5 net) operated wells in the Williston Basin. As of that date we were running a three-rig drilling program. In the first quarter of FY2015, we added a fourth drilling rig and plan to continue a four-rig program throughout FY2015. During FY2015, we anticipate drilling 48 to 56 gross operated wells and completing 44 to 50 gross operated wells in North Dakota or eastern Montana for completion in the Bakken Shale or Three Forks formations. We target the Middle Bakken formation between the Upper and Lower Bakken Shales at an approximate vertical depth of 10,300 to 11,300 feet. We also target the Three Forks formation, which is present immediately below the Lower Bakken Shale. The operations of our non-operated leasehold positions are primarily conducted through agreements with major operators in the Williston Basin, including Oasis Petroleum, Hess Corporation, Continental Resources, Statoil, Newfield Exploration, EOG Resources, XTO Energy, Whiting Petroleum, Slawson Exploration Company and Kodiak Oil & Gas Corporation. These companies are experienced operators in the development of the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations. Since commencement of drilling in May 2012 through the end of FY2014, we have elected to participate in the drilling of 250 gross (11.7 net) non-operated wells, 203 gross (9.7 net) of which are producing and 47 gross (2.1 net) are in various stages of permitting, drilling or completion. 12 Table of Contents Discussed below are key aspects of our drilling program in our Core Acreage: Long Laterals. Based upon our analysis of well costs and the performance from our operated wells and other operators' wells, we believe long laterals (~10,000 feet) in our horizontal wells are better than short laterals (~5,000 feet or less) for wells in our Core Acreage. Although utilizing long laterals is more expensive, we estimate that the additional costs of drilling the longer lateral and adding more fracture stimulation stages is more than offset by the associated incremental increase in oil production cash flows. Accordingly, we plan to continue drilling ~10,000 foot laterals throughout our Core Acreage position. Multi-Well Pads. We typically drill two or more wells per rig visit to each pad. As we continue the development stage of our drilling, we expect the average number of wells drilled per pad to increase. We have designed our initial pads to accommodate the increased number of wells expected on each pad. We plan to continue capitalizing on the many benefits of pad drilling to increase our efficiencies and reduce costs. Pad drilling allows for the reduction of rig mobilization and demobilization costs, the aggregation of necessary infrastructure and distribution of costs for the same. Pad drilling also allows for increased efficiencies and cost savings when completing our wells using techniques such as zipper fracturing. Utilization of zipper fracturing techniques allows the simultaneous completion of two or more wells by alternating perforation and pressure pumping operations. We also perform other simultaneous operations on our well pads, allowing for continuous production from an existing well while drilling and completing activities for another well on the same pad. Pad drilling also reduces the surface footprint of our operations. Wellbore Spacing. Consistent with other operators near our Core Acreage position, we are developing our wellbores on tighter spacing patterns. Our initial test drilling included three wellbores drilled within 600 feet, laterally, of one another in the Middle Bakken formation, and these wells continue to perform well. We currently have seven DSUs with wells spaced within 600 feet, laterally, of one another. These and other tests performed by Triangle and other operators suggest that up to eight Middle Bakken wells can be drilled per DSU without significant communication between wellbores. Contiguous Acreage. Our Core Acreage operated leasehold is largely contiguous and, by virtue of our high working interest and operatorship, we can control the development pace and location of surface facilities. We believe this strategy, combined with pad drilling, Caliber's infrastructure and efficiencies provided by RockPile, should maximize the efficiency of our drilling and completion program and minimize the capital costs of developing our acreage position. Acreage Held by Production. Our drilling activity has resulted in the majority of our operated drilling units being held by production. As a result, we are now able to more systematically plan our drilling and completion activities. This provides increased flexibility in our capital program and allows us to more efficiently develop our leaseholds toward the proper ultimate spacing for each drilling unit. Infrastructure. As of January 31, 2014, we have 54 operated wells, 43 (80%) of which are currently connected to Caliber or third-party midstream pipelines and processing facilities for natural gas liquids, allowing for the reduction of flared volumes and the capture of additional revenue from the liquids-rich gas that is produced with our oil. Caliber has 31 of our operated wells connected to fresh water delivery and 17 operated wells connected to its oil and produced water gathering infrastructure. Most of our Core Acreage will soon be served by similar Caliber or third-party oil and natural gas gathering systems. The majority of our wells are also in the process of being connected to regional oil and natural gas pipelines. Moving produced fluids (oil, natural gas and water) through pipelines eliminates trucking costs and associated environmental disturbance, and mitigates weather related production interruptions. Upon completion of 13 Table of Contents Caliber's Medium Haul Pipeline to Alexander, North Dakota, a large portion of our production will have access to various means of transportation to market, which should maximize revenue while minimizing impacts to the environment. CanadaNova Scotia We also hold leasehold interests in acreage in the Maritimes Basin of Nova Scotia, Canada. Nova Scotia currently has in place a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing and currently does not allow the use of salt water disposal wells. We fully impaired our Nova Scotia leasehold assets as of January 31, 2012. Our Canadian assets are not material to our asset base or development plans. Reserves Net Reserves of Crude Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids at Fiscal Year-End 2014, 2013 and 2012 Approximately 99% of the Company's proved reserves at January 31, 2014 are primarily associated with properties located in our Core Acreage. Our proved reserves are located in the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations. The table below summarizes our estimates of proved reserves as of January 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the estimated projected future cash flows (before income taxes) from those proved reserves, and the PV-10 Value of the proved reserves at January 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012: As of January 31, 2014 2013 2012 Proved developed: Oil (Mbbls) 13,734 4,985 538 Natural gas (MMcf) 10,930 5,906 202 NGL (Mbbls) 1,440   Proved undeveloped: Oil (Mbbls) 18,182 7,555 827 Natural gas (MMcf) 15,574 6,679 472 NGL (Mbbls) 2,541   Total proved oil reserves (Mbbls) 31,916 12,540 1,365 Total proved natural gas reserves (MMcf) 26,504 12,585 674 Total proved NGL reserves (Mbbls) 3,981   Total proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves (Mboe) 40,314 14,637 1,477 PV-10 Values (in thousands) of proved reserves: PV-10 Value of proved developed reserves $ 471,764 $ 165,484 $ 19,393 PV-10 Value of proved undeveloped reserves $ 206,141 $ 59,377 $ 10,035 PV-10 Value of total proved reserves $ 677,905 $ 224,861 $ 29,428 The increase in our total proved reserves in FY2014 of 25,677 Mboe resulted primarily from our drilling and completion activity on the Bakken and Three Forks formations properties. As a result of our drilling program, we increased the number of proved undeveloped ("PUD") locations from 59 gross (19.8 net) at fiscal year-end 2013 to 104 gross (52.5 net) at fiscal year-end 2014. These PUD locations offset our existing producing wells or are located in drill spacing units that offset producing wells. In estimating proved reserves, Triangle used the SEC definition of proved reserves. Projected future cash flows were based on economic and operating conditions as of the respective January 31st estimation date except that future commodity prices used in the projections reflected a simple average of prices for the well or property on the first day of each of the twelve months in the fiscal year ended on the estimation date. Prices of $97.49 per Bbl for oil, $54.25 per barrel for natural 14 Table of Contents gas liquids, and $3.73 per MMbtu for natural gas were adjusted for regional price differentials and other factors to arrive at prices of $93.09 per Bbl for oil, $44.10 per barrel for natural gas liquids, and $3.99 per Mcf for natural gas, which were used in the calculation of proved reserves at January 31, 2014. Volumes of reserves that will actually be recovered and cash flows that will actually be received from production may differ significantly from the proved reserve estimates and the related projected cash flows, respectively. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of, among other things, the quality of available data, and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities that are ultimately recovered. The following table reconciles (a) the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to our proved oil and natural gas reserves ("Standardized Measure"), a measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") to (b) the PV-10 Value (a non-GAAP financial measure) of our proved reserves. The difference is due to the fact that PV-10 Value excludes the impact of income taxes.

Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 24Unaudited Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures. Proved Undeveloped Reserves At January 31, 2014, we estimated proved undeveloped reserves of 23,319 Mboe, which represents 58% of our total proved reserves as compared to 8,668 Mboe or 59% of our total proved reserves at January 31, 2013. In connection with our drilling and completion program, we incurred approximately $74.9 million (averaging $9.4 million per net well) related to the conversion of 3,701 Mboe (32 gross wells, 7.9 net wells) from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. 15 Table of Contents Changes in our proved undeveloped reserves are summarized in the following table: Mboe Gross Wells Net Wells At January 31, 2013 8,668 59 19.8 Became developed reserves in fiscal year 2014 (3,701 ) (32 ) (7.9 ) Traded for net acres in other drill spacing units (353 ) (4 ) (0.8 ) Negative revisions (31 )   Positive revisions 115   Acquisitions 5,466 13 11.8 Extensions and discoveries of proved reserves 13,155 68 29.6 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ At January 31, 2014 23,319 104 52.5 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ For proved undeveloped locations at January 31, 2014, the following table provides further information on the timing and status of operated and non-operated locations: Development Wells PUD Locations Gross Net Proved undeveloped locations: For which Triangle operated wells are to be drilled and completed by December 31, 2018 85 85 51.3 For which non-operated wells were in-progress at January 31, 2014 and are expected to be completed in fiscal year 2015 2 2  That are non-operated wells with drilling permits 2 2 0.2 That are non-operated wells to be drilled by July 31, 2016 15 15 1.0 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total 104 104 52.5 At January 31, 2014, we have no proved undeveloped reserves that are scheduled for development five years or more beyond the date the reserves were initially recorded. Reserve Estimation Methods The process of estimating proved reserves involves exercising professional judgment to select estimation method(s) within three categories: (1) performance-based methods, (2) volumetric-based methods, and (3) analogy. The selection of estimation method(s) considers (i) the geoscience and engineering data available at the time, (ii) the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated, and (iii) the development stage and production history of the well, property or field. For proved reserves estimated at January 31, 2014 and 2013, Triangle's Senior Reservoir Engineer used the following general estimation methods: Proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells were estimated by performance methods or by analogy. Performance methods included decline curve analysis, which utilized extrapolation of historical production through the estimation date where such historical data was considered to be definitive. Where such historical data was insufficient for extrapolation, the analogy method was used. Proved undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method. 16 Table of Contents Internal Controls over Reserve Estimation The Company engaged Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. ("Cawley Gillespie"), an independent petroleum engineering firm, to perform an audit of Triangle's internal estimates of proved reserves. Cawley Gillespie's FY2014 year-end reserves audit report was prepared based upon a review of property interests being appraised, production from such properties, current costs of operation and development, current prices for production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, geoscience and engineering data, and other information we provide to them. The internal reserve estimates and supporting schedules are prepared by our Reserve Engineer and reviewed by management prior to being provided to Cawley Gillespie. Cawley Gillespie's FY2014 year-end reserves audit report (filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report) states that Cawley Gillespie is a Texas Registered Engineering Firm (F-693), made up of independent Registered Professional Engineers and Geologists. The firm has provided petroleum consulting services to the oil and gas industry for over 50 years. This audit was supervised by Mr. W. Todd Brooker, Senior Vice President at Cawley Gillespie and a State of Texas Licensed Professional Engineer (License #83462). Mr. Brooker received his Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 1989, and joined Cawley Gillespie as a Reservoir Engineer in 1992. Developed and Undeveloped Acreage As of January 31, 2014, we had approximately 2,667 lease agreements representing approximately 217,377 gross (93,552 net) acres in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana. The following table sets forth our gross and net acres of developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas leases: Developed Acres Undeveloped Acres Total Acres Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net North Dakota 94,721 31,323 40,879 9,188 135,600 40,511 Montana 1,176 406 80,601 52,635 81,777 53,041 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total 95,897 31,729 121,480 61,823 217,377 93,552 We are subject to lease expirations if we or the operator of our non-operated acreage do not commence the development of operations within the agreed terms of our leases. All of our leases for undeveloped acreage will expire at the end of their respective primary terms except for leases where we (i) make extension payment(s) under the lease terms, (ii) renew the existing lease, (iii) establish commercial production in paying quantities, or (iv) trigger some other "savings clause" in the relevant lease. We expect to establish production from most of our acreage prior to expiration of the applicable lease. However, there can be no guarantee we will do so. 17 Table of Contents The table below shows by future fiscal year (i) costs of available lease extensions, (ii) net acres expiring without lease extensions, and (iii) net acres expiring with lease extensions (assuming the leases are not developed and held by production): Net Acres Expiring Fiscal Year Future Extension Costs (in thousands) If No Extensions With All Extensions 2015 $ 1,832 20,458 12,673 2016 $ 215 18,710 19,752 2017 $  18,894 24,560 2018 $  353 1,430 2019 $    Thereafter $  197 197 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 2,047 58,612 58,612 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Already extended   ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 58,612 58,612 Held by production 3,211 3,211 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Undeveloped Net Acres 61,823 61,823 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The table above shows that, with all currently allowed extensions, 12,673 net acres would expire in FY2015 if no drilling occurs or other actions are taken to further extend the lease life. We anticipate that approximately 8,610 net acres will expire in FY2015, of which approximately 185 acres are in our Core Acreage. However, we are taking steps to minimize expirations of those leaseholds we believe are accretive to our drilling and development program. Drilling and Other Exploratory and Development Activities The following table presents the gross and net number of exploration wells and development wells drilled in the U.S. during fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, based on the date of first sales or capable of selling. There was no drilling activity in Canada during the same periods. The number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells completed at any time during the fiscal year, regardless of when drilling was initiated. Well completion refers to installation of permanent equipment for production of oil or 18 Table of Contents natural gas, or, in the case of a dry well, to reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has been abandoned after little or no production.

None of our gross productive wells had multiple completions. Our count of productive wells does not include wells that were awaiting completion, in the process of completion, or awaiting flowback subsequent to fracture stimulation as of that date. We have not participated in any wells targeting natural gas reserves. Costs Incurred and Capitalized Costs The table below present costs incurred in oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration and development activities in the U.S. during fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012. There were no such costs in Canada in those periods.

We are unable to predict the future impact on amortization rates. Oilfield Services RockPile, our wholly-owned subsidiary initially capitalized in October 2011, is a provider of hydraulic oilfield and complementary well completion services to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in the Williston Basin. RockPile purchased its first set of equipment, collectively known as a "spread", in the first half of 2012. RockPile's first spread commenced 12-hour operations in July 2012 and 24-hour operations in September 2012. RockPile commenced 24-hour operations with a second spread in July 2013 and anticipates delivery of its third spread in the second quarter of FY2015. RockPile's management team has extensive experience providing oilfield services in the Williston Basin. 19 Table of Contents RockPile provides a variety of oilfield services including, but not limited to, pressure pumping, wireline, perforating, pumping and pump rental. The use of these services lowers our realized well completion costs and affords us greater control over completion schedules, quality control and pay cycles. In FY2014, RockPile increased year-over-year completions by approximately 376%, completing 31 TUSA operated wells and 50 third-party wells, as compared to 12 TUSA operated wells and five third-party wells in FY2013. RockPile contributed $98.2 million to our revenue for the year ended January 31, 2014. We believe that the breadth of RockPile's services and the experience and expertise of their personnel give it a competitive advantage relative to many of its competitors in the region. RockPile's customers use hydraulic fracturing or pressure pumping services to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability, which restricts the natural flow of hydrocarbons. Hydraulic fracturing involves pumping fluid down a well casing or tubing at sufficient pressure to cause the underground producing formation to fracture, allowing the oil or natural gas to flow more freely. A propping agent, or proppant, is suspended in the fracturing fluid and pumped into the fractures created by the fracturing process in the underground formation to prop the fractures open. Proppants generally consist of sand, bauxite, resin-coated sand or ceramic particles and other engineered proprietary materials. The extremely high pressure required to stimulate wells in the regions in which we operate presents a challenging environment for achieving a successfully fractured horizontal well. As a result, an important element of the services RockPile provides to producers is assisting with well completion design, which includes determining the proper fluid, proppant and injection specifications to maximize production. In addition, RockPile's workover rig division provides intervention and remedial services such as drill out, clean outs, installation and replacement of pumps, packers and frac strings, swabbing, and well repair and maintenance. As the Williston Basin matures, demand for remedial service is also expected to increase. RockPile has historically operated exclusively in the Williston Basin. While RockPile expects that the Williston Basin will remain the focus of its operations, it is currently evaluating opportunities in other areas. Midstream Services Caliber is an energy infrastructure joint venture that provides variety of services including fresh water delivery, produced water transportation and disposal, crude oil gathering and stabilization, and natural gas gathering and processing, to us and other operating exploration and production companies in the Williston Basin. Caliber was created in October 2012, and capitalized through initial funding commitments of $100.0 million in equity capital contributions ($70.0 million from FREIF, $30.0 million from Triangle). In September 2013, FREIF committed an additional $80.0 million in equity capital contributions. Caliber is managed and governed by its general partner, Caliber Midstream GP, LLC, of which FREIF and Triangle each own a 50% non-economic interest and share governance equally. We currently hold a 30% economic interest in Caliber. Caliber's midstream operations are currently located in McKenzie County, North Dakota, but it plans to expand its operations across the Williston Basin. We have connected 31 of our operated wells to Caliber's midstream system. We expect to have over 80 of our operated wells in McKenzie County connected to Caliber's midstream system by the end of FY2015. Our investment in Caliber is approximately $68.5 million, which includes our initial investment of $30.0 million and our share of Caliber's net income, equity investment derivatives (at fair value), less cash distributions. Caliber's net income totaled approximately $7.3 million for FY2014, and Triangle's share of Caliber's net income totaled approximately $2.2 million. After elimination of intra-company profits related to Caliber's provision of services to our operated wells, we recognized no consolidated income from Caliber in FY2014. 20 Table of Contents Pricing and Production Cost Information The following table summarizes the volumes and realized prices for oil and natural gas produced and sold from the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations properties in which we held an interest during the periods indicated. Realized prices presented below exclude the effects of hedges and derivative activities. Also presented is a summary of related production costs per Boe. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2014 2013 2012 Net Sales Volume Oil (Bbls) 1,754,375 451,784 92,694 Natural gas (Mcf) 626,447 188,044 11,758 Natural gas liquids (Bbls) 70,477 5,054 216 Total equivalent barrels 1,929,260 488,179 94,870 Average Sales Price Per Unit Oil price (per Bbl) $ 88.07 $ 85.29 $ 86.40 Natural gas price (per Mcf) $ 4.39 $ 4.78 $ 9.10 Natural gas liquids price (per Bbl) $ 46.72 $ 36.01 $ 92.59 Weighted average price (per Boe) $ 83.22 $ 81.15 $ 85.76 Production tax (per Boe) $ 9.33 $ 9.20 $ 9.44 Lease operating expenses (per Boe) $ 7.49 $ 7.11 $ 9.50 Gathering, transportation and processing (per Boe) $ 2.23 $ 0.31 $ 0.23 Sales from our operated wells began in May 2012. Our net sales volumes from operated wells totaled 1,341 Mbbls of oil for FY2014. We expect to begin selling crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas through delivery points on Caliber's gathering system in FY2015. Significant Customers Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Customers In the U.S., sales of produced crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are made at negotiated prices. Of our $160.5 million in revenues from oil and gas sales in FY2014, $154.5 million is revenue from sales of crude oil, and of that approximately $117.5 million is our share of revenue from sales of crude oil from the 54 wells we operated. For wells that we operate, oil production has been sold at the wellhead, or a location nearby, under short term agreements with several purchasers. While the pricing terms of these agreements vary by purchaser, they all reflect a price determined by the current NYMEX West Texas Intermediate contract, less a discount that is either calculated, fixed, or a combination of calculated and fixed. We sell our oil, natural gas and NGLs to multiple customers. In FY2014, we made sales of operated well production directly to five oil purchasers, one NGL purchaser and one natural gas purchaser. In FY2014, we had revenues from two customers (both crude oil purchasers) that exceeded 10% of our $258.7 million in total revenues in FY2014. For one customer, our FY2014 revenues were approximately $83.1 million. For the second customer, our FY2014 revenues were approximately $63.9 million. We also have sales through unrelated operators of wells in which we have revenue interests. We do not believe the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our Company since there are numerous potential purchasers of our production. We regularly monitor the credit worthiness of customers and may require parental guarantees, letters of credit or prepayments when deemed necessary. 21 Table of Contents For our economic interests in wells operated by third-parties, substantially all of our sales of crude oil, NGL and natural gas in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 were sold through arrangements made by the operators and at sales points at or close to the producing wells. These third-party operators include a variety of exploration and production companies ranging from large publicly-traded companies to small privately-owned companies. For our economic interests in wells operated by third-parties, we have the right to take and sell our proportionate share of production, rather than have the operator arrange such sale; however, we did not do so in fiscal years 2014, 2013 or 2012. The operators collect the sales proceeds and pass on to us our proportionate share of sales, net of severance taxes and royalties paid either by the purchaser or the operator on our behalf. Pressure Pumping Customers The ability of RockPile to acquire and retain business depends substantially upon the number of oil and natural gas wells being drilled, the depth and drilling conditions of such wells and the number of well completions. These factors can be affected by changes in commodities prices, the overall economic environment, and industry trends and technological advancements. RockPile's principal customers consist of independent oil and natural gas producers in need of horizontal well completion and oilfield services in western North Dakota and eastern Montana. During FY2014, RockPile provided pressure pumping services for 31 wells operated by TUSA and 50 wells operated by third parties. We do not believe that the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our Company since there are numerous operators in the Williston Basin in need of pressure pumping and related services. Delivery Commitments In October 2012, TUSA entered into two midstream services agreements with Caliber North Dakota LLC ("Caliber North Dakota"); one for crude oil gathering, stabilization, treating and redelivery, and one for (i) natural gas compression, gathering, dehydration, processing and redelivery; (ii) produced water transportation and disposal services; and (iii) fresh water transportation for TUSA's oil and natural gas completion and production operations. Under the agreements, TUSA committed to deliver minimum monthly revenues derived from the fees paid by TUSA to Caliber for volumes of oil, natural gas, produced water, and fresh water for a primary term of 15 years beginning on the in-service date of the Caliber facilities (the date that the Caliber North Dakota central facility has been substantially completed and has commenced commercial operation, estimated to occur in the first quarter of FY2015). On September 12, 2013, TUSA and Caliber North Dakota amended and restated the two agreements. Under the amended and restated agreements, TUSA maintained the revenue commitments included in the original agreements and added a commitment to deliver additional minimum monthly revenues derived from the fees paid by TUSA to Caliber North Dakota related to an increased acreage dedication and increased firm volume commitment. The additional minimum monthly revenue commitments will commence on the in-service date of certain incremental Caliber North Dakota facilities (estimated to occur in the second quarter of FY2015). The minimum commitment over the term of the agreements is $405.0 million. Also on September 12, 2013, TUSA and Caliber Measurement Services LLC ("Caliber Measurement") entered into a gathering services agreement pursuant to which Caliber Measurement will provide certain gathering-related measurement services to TUSA. Competitors In the Williston Basin, TUSA competes with a number of larger public and private exploration and production companies such as Continental Resources, Statoil, Kodiak Oil & Gas Corporation, Enerplus Resources Corporation, Oasis Petroleum, Newfield Exploration and Whiting Petroleum. Many of our competitors possess significantly more personnel and experience in the Williston Basin and greater access to capital resources than we do. Such companies may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and exploratory prospects than the Company's financial or human resources permit. 22 Table of Contents RockPile's competition includes large integrated oilfield services companies, a significant number of regional competitors, and a limited number of smaller service companies. RockPile's competitors include, but are not limited to, Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes. Caliber competes with both large and small-scale pipeline operators, producer-owned midstream systems, as well as trucking companies and other oilfield services companies. Seasonality Due to United States refineries having to import most of their crude oil, there is little seasonality in the demand for crude oil produced in North Dakota. Oil prices in North Dakota are impacted more by global oil demand and by the availability of crude oil transportation capacity and related services and infrastructure. Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or cool summers sometime lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during lower demand periods, which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. Certain of our drilling, completion, and other operations are subject to seasonal limitations. Our operations are conducted in areas subject to extreme weather conditions during certain parts of the year, primarily in the winter and the spring. During these periods, drilling, completion, and other operations can be delayed because of cold, snow, and other winter weather conditions. Additionally, certain state and local governments in our area of operations have enacted "frost laws" to protect their roadways during the spring as the ground thaws and makes the roads unstable. Passage over certain county roads is restricted by weight. For state roads, additional fees are required to obtain over-the-road permits. Frost laws result in logistical challenges that could potentially result in temporary interruptions in our operations. Complications from adverse weather conditions are one reason why we are in the process of having future crude oil, natural gas and produced water transported away from the wellhead by Caliber's pipeline, rather than by truck, for our operated wells. We do not currently believe that seasonal fluctuations will have a material impact on our performance. Governmental Regulation Our business is affected by numerous laws and regulations, including energy, environmental, conservation, tax, and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations, and violations are subject to injunctive action, as well as administrative, civil and criminal penalties. The effects of these laws and regulations, as well as other laws or regulations that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In view of the many uncertainties with respect to future laws and regulations, including their applicability to us, we cannot predict the overall effect of such laws and regulations on our future operations. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations and that the existence and enforcement of such laws and regulations are generally no more restrictive on our operations than they are on other similar companies in the oil and natural gas industry. Environmental Laws and Regulations Like the oil and natural gas industry in general, our properties are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and local laws and regulations designed to protect and preserve natural resources and the environment. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation affecting 23 Table of Contents the oil and natural gas industry is generally toward stricter standards, and this trend is likely to continue. These laws and regulations often require a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities; limit or prohibit access, especially in wilderness areas and areas with endangered or threatened plant or animal species; impose restrictions on construction, drilling, and other exploration and production activities; regulate air emissions, wastewater, and other production and waste streams from our operations; impose substantial liabilities for pollution that may result from our operations; and require the reclamation of certain lands. The permits required for many of our operations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities, and in some cases private parties, have the power to enforce compliance with environmental regulations, and violations are subject to fines, compliance orders, and other enforcement actions. We are not aware of any material noncompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with applicable environmental requirements. However, given the complex regulatory requirements applicable to our operations, and the rapidly changing nature of environmental laws in our industry, we cannot predict our future exposure concerning such matters, and our future costs to achieve compliance or resolve potential violations could be significant. Waste Disposal and Contamination Issues The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), also known as the "Superfund law," and comparable state laws may impose strict, joint, and several liability, without regard to fault, on classes of persons responsible for the release of CERCLA "hazardous substances" into the environment. These persons include the current and former owners and operators of the site where a release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance at a site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. Such claims may be filed under CERCLA, as well as state common law theories, or state laws that are modeled after CERCLA. In the course of our operations, we generate waste that may fall within CERCLA's definition of "hazardous substances." Therefore, governmental agencies or third parties could seek to hold us responsible for all or part of the costs to clean up a site at which such hazardous substances may have been released, or other damages resulting from a release. The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable state statutes govern the management, storage, treatment, disposal, and cleanup of solid and hazardous waste, and authorize substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance. Drilling fluids, produced waters and many of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or gas currently are exempt under federal law from regulation as RCRA "hazardous" wastes and instead are regulated as non-hazardous "solid" wastes. It is possible, however, that oil and gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Any such change could result in an increase in our operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial position. Also, in the course of operations, we generate some amounts of industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, and waste oils, that may be regulated as hazardous wastes under RCRA and comparable state laws and regulations. Regulation of Discharges to Water and Water Supplies The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended (the "Clean Water Act"), and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of "pollutants" into waters of the United States, including wetlands, without appropriate permits. These controls generally have 24 Table of Contents become more stringent over time, and it is possible that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future. Pollutants under the Clean Water Act are defined to include produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings, and other substances related to the oil and natural gas industry. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges or noncompliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. They also can impose substantial liability for the costs of removal or remediation associated with discharges of oil, hazardous substances, or other pollutants. The Clean Water Act also regulates stormwater discharges from industrial properties and construction sites, and requires separate permits and implementation of a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan ("SWPPP") establishing best management practices, training, and periodic monitoring of covered activities. Certain operations are also required to develop and implement Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure ("SPCC") plans or facility response plans to address potential oil spills. Our underground injection operations are subject to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, as well as analogous state laws and regulations. Under Part C of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") established the Underground Injection Control ("UIC") program, which established the minimum program requirements for state programs regulating underground injection activities. The UIC program includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. Federal and state regulations require permits from applicable regulatory agencies to operate underground injection wells. In addition, concerns regarding the underground disposal of produced water into Class II UIC wells, including concerns regarding seismic consequences, may result in stricter regulation and increased costs associated with oil and natural gas wastewater disposal. Oil Spill Regulation The BP crude oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and generally heightened industry scrutiny has resulted and may result in new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines, and enforcement interpretations relating to water protection and specifically to oil spill prevention and enforcement. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA"), augments the Clean Water Act and imposes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that are the source of a release of oil into waters of the United States. The OPA and its associated regulations impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. For example, operators of oil and gas facilities must develop, implement, and maintain facility response plans, conduct annual spill training for employees, and provide varying degrees of financial assurance to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to oil spills. In addition, owners and operators of oil and gas facilities may be subject to liability for cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages resulting from oil spills. These and similar state laws also govern the management and disposal of produced waters from our extraction process. Currently, wastewater associated with oil and natural gas production from shale formations is prohibited from being directly discharged to waterways and other waters of the United States. While some of our wastewater is reused or re-injected, a significant amount still requires disposal. As a result, some wastewater is transported to third-party treatment plants. In October 2011, citing concerns that third-party treatment plants may not be properly equipped to handle wastewater from shale gas operations, the EPA announced that it will consider federal pre-treatment standards for these wastewaters. Proposed standards are expected in 2014. We cannot predict the EPA's future actions in this regard, but increased and more stringent future regulation of produced waters or other waste streams could have a material impact on our operations. 25 Table of Contents Our operations also could be adversely impacted if we are unable to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water, used in our exploration and production operations. Currently, the quantity of water required in certain completion operations, such as hydraulic fracturing, and changing regulations governing usage, may lead to water constraints and supply concerns (particularly in some parts of the country). Air Emissions and Climate Change The federal Clean Air Act and implementing state air quality laws and regulations impose permit requirements, operational restrictions, and emission control requirements on certain sources of emissions used in our operations. In August 2012, the EPA published final New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ("NESHAPs") that amend existing NSPS and NESHAPs applicable to the oil and natural gas industry and create new air quality-related standards for oil and natural gas production, transmission, and distribution facilities. The standards established new requirements for emissions from compressors, dehydrators, storage tanks, and other production equipment, as well as more stringent leak-detection requirements for natural gas processing plants. Importantly, these standards include requirements for hydraulically fractured natural gas wells and apply to newly drilled and fractured natural gas wells, as well as existing natural gas wells that are refractured. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these standards from both the industry and the environmental community, as well as court challenges to the standards. In September 2013, the EPA issued revised standards largely focused on storage tank requirements. The revised standards were responsive to some, but not all, industry concerns. Although most of the requirements of the new regulations applicable to hydraulically fractured natural gas wells do not become effective until 2015, other requirements of these new and revised standards may require us to modify our current facilities and operations and may increase future costs of our operations. In addition, the EPA currently is reconsidering other portions of the standards that may broaden the scope of the regulations or otherwise require us to modify our current facilities and operations and may increase future costs of our operations. After the United States Supreme Court's holding in Massachusetts v. EPA that carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases ("GHGs") fall under the Clean Air Act's definition of "air pollutant," the EPA issued a notice of finding and determination that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment, which allows the EPA to regulate GHG emissions under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. Although a decision from the United States Supreme Court regarding the scope of the EPA's authority to regulate GHGs from stationary sources is expected in June 2014, the EPA has begun to implement GHG-related reporting and permitting rules. Similarly, the U.S. Congress has considered, and may in the future consider, "cap and trade" legislation that would establish an economy-wide cap on GHG emissions in the United States and would require most sources of GHG emissions to obtain GHG emission "allowances" corresponding to their annual emissions of GHGs. A number of states also have taken legal measures to reduce GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional cap-and-trade programs, but we do not currently conduct business in those states. For example, although we do not currently operate in Colorado, in 2014, the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission adopted the nation's first rules targeting GHG emissions (i.e., methane) from upstream oil and gas operations. These new Colorado rules could serve as a regulatory model for other states, including Montana or North Dakota, or for the federal government. Canada, where we also hold oil and natural gas leases, also is implementing laws concerning GHG emissions. On March 28, 2014, the Obama administration announced that in the spring of 2014, the EPA will assess several sources of methane and other emissions from the oil and gas sector. In the fall of 2014, the EPA is expected to determine how to pursue further methane reductions from these sectors. If the EPA decides to develop additional regulations, it plans to complete those 26 Table of Contents regulations by the end of 2016. The administration also announced that it will identify "downstream" methane reduction opportunities at some point in the future. Later this year, the Bureau of Land Management ("BLM) will propose updated standards to reduce venting and flaring from oil and gas production on public lands. Finally, there has been significant focus on the flaring of natural gas in the Williston Basin. Increased regulatory pressure or litigation regarding flaring or reduction of methane emissions could affect our operations or increase future costs of our operations. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs or flaring likely would require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our production. These or future federal, state, regional or international monitoring or regulatory requirements relating to climate change could require us to obtain permits or allowances for our GHG emissions, install new pollution controls, increase our operational costs, limit our operations, or adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing Hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as "fracing," is the primary well-completion method used in the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations. Hydraulic fracturing is a process that creates fractures extending from the wellbore into a rock formation that enables oil or natural gas to move more easily through the otherwise impermeable rock to a production well. Fractures typically are created through the injection of water, chemicals, and sand (or some other type of "proppant") into the rock formation. Although hydraulic fracturing has been an accepted practice in the oil and natural gas industry for many years, its use has dramatically increased in the last decade, and concerns over its potential environmental effects have received increasing attention from regulators and the public. Several federal agencies, including the EPA, recently have asserted potential regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing, and the EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities, with the results of the study anticipated to be available for review in 2014. Moreover, the EPA also is studying the potential impact of wastewater derived from hydraulic fracturing activities and by 2014 plans to propose standards that such wastewater must meet before being transported to a treatment plant. In May 2013, the BLM published a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking that would regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands, replacing a prior draft of proposed rulemaking issued by the agency in May 2012. Among other things, the revised proposed rule would continue to require public disclosure of certain chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands, confirmation that wells used in hydraulic fracturing operations meet appropriate construction standards, and development of appropriate plans for managing flowback water that returns to the surface. In addition, Congress has considered, and may in the future consider, legislation that would amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to encompass hydraulic fracturing activities. In the past, such proposed legislation would have required hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, including disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process, and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. Some states already have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, requirements that could restrict or impose additional requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. For example, Montana and North Dakota have enacted regulations requiring operators to disclose information about hydraulic fracturing fluids on a well-by-well basis, and require specific construction and testing requirements for wells that will be hydraulically fractured. In addition, in Montana, operators generally must obtain approval from the state before hydraulic fracturing occurs and submit a report after the work is completed. Some states, municipalities, and other local governmental bodies also have purported to regulate, and in some cases prohibit, hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, Nova Scotia currently has in place a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing and Vermont has banned the use of the technology. 27 Table of Contents Finally, the EPA is moving forward with Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA") rulemaking, which will collect expansive information on the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing fluid, including health-related data, from chemical manufacturers and processors. The EPA expects to issue an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("ANPRM") in 2014. The TSCA rulemaking follows the general trend of increased disclosure and transparency associated with the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing among the various states (e.g., North Dakota), including widespread participation by industry in a publicly searchable registry website developed and maintained by the Ground Water Protection Council ("FracFocus"). All of these initiatives present significant, but uncertain, risk of additional regulation of the oil and natural gas industry. As discussed in Note 5Oil and Natural Gas Properties in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, Nova Scotia, where we own oil and natural gas properties, is currently evaluating how hydraulic fracturing should be regulated and does not allow the use of salt water disposal wells. In addition, concerns have been raised about the potential for earthquakes associated with disposal of produced waters into Class II UIC wells. The EPA's current regulatory requirements for such wells do not require the consideration of seismic impacts when issuing permits. We cannot predict the EPA's future actions in this regard. Certain states, such as Ohio, where earthquakes have been alleged to be linked to UIC disposal activities, have proposed regulations that would require mandatory reviews of seismic data and related testing and monitoring as part of the future permitting process for UIC wells. Regulation of Production of Natural Gas and Oil The production of natural gas and oil is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of natural gas and oil properties, and the regulation of well spacing or density. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations, or to have reductions in well spacing or density. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction. The states in which we operate also regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, maintenance of bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and limits on the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations. Regulation of Transportation and Sales of Natural Gas The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or NGA, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or NGPA, and regulations issued under those statutes. FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. Since 1985, FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. Although FERC's orders do not directly regulate natural gas 28 Table of Contents producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. The Domenici Barton Energy Policy Act of 2005, or EP Act of 2005, amended the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC, and furthermore provided FERC with additional civil penalty authority. The EP Act of 2005 provides FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1.0 million per day for violations of the NGA and increased FERC's civil penalty authority under the NGPA to $1.0 million per violation per day. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. On January 19, 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670, a rule implementing the anti-market manipulation provision of the EP Act of 2005, and subsequently denied rehearing. The rules make it unlawful to: (1) in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The new anti-market manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted "in connection with" gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements under Order No. 704. On December 26, 2007, FERC issued Order No. 704, a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing. Under Order No. 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMbtus of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including natural gas gatherers and marketers, are now required to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order No. 704. Order No. 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers, and if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC's policy statement on price reporting. Gathering services, which occur upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, are regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. In some cases, FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our costs of getting gas to point of sale locations. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally include various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory-take requirements. Although nondiscriminatory-take regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA. Although the FERC has not made any formal determinations with respect to any of our facilities, we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline's status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and the FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. 29 Table of Contents Intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. The price at which we sell natural gas is not currently subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the NGPA and culminated in adoption of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act which removed all price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. Our sales of natural gas are also subject to requirements under the Commodity Exchange Act, or CEA, and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC. The CEA prohibits any person from manipulating or attempting to manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce or futures on such commodity. The CEA also prohibits knowingly delivering, or causing to be delivered, false or misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of a commodity. Changes in law and to FERC policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action FERC will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. Employees As of January 31, 2014, we had 332 full time employees compared to 132 full time employees at January 31, 2013. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. Offices We maintain our principal office at 1200 17th Street, Suite 2600, Denver, Colorado, 80202, and our telephone number is (303) 260-7125. We also own or lease field offices and facilities in North Dakota. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report in evaluating our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, other than those we describe below, that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. You should also refer to the other information contained in this annual report, including the Forward-Looking Statements section in Item 1, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a further discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our business. Except where the context otherwise indicates, references in this section to "we," "our," "ours," and "us" includes our subsidiaries and our interest in Caliber. The risks described below relating to oil and natural gas exploration, exploitation and development activities affect TUSA directly but also affect RockPile and Caliber because the materialization of those risks, whether experienced by TUSA or other customers or potential customers of RockPile or Caliber, may adversely affect demand for the products and services provided by RockPile and Caliber. Risks Relating to Our Business Oil and natural gas prices are volatile and change for reasons that are beyond our control. Decreases in the price we receive for our production adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Declines in the prices we receive for our production adversely affect many aspects of our business, including our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity, rate of growth and the carrying value of our properties, all of which depend primarily or in part upon those prices. Declines in the prices we receive for our production also adversely affect our ability to finance capital expenditures, make acquisitions, raise capital and satisfy our financial obligations. In addition, declines in prices reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and the expected cash flows from that production and, as a result, adversely affect the quantity and present value of proved reserves. Among other things, a reduction in our reserves can limit the capital available to us, as the maximum amount of available borrowing under TUSA's revolving credit facility is, and the availability of other sources of capital likely will be, based to a significant degree on the estimated quantity and present value of those reserves. Declines in prices would also reduce the demand for services provided by RockPile and Caliber, adversely affecting their revenue and profitability. Oil and natural gas are commodities and their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Prices have historically been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. The prices of oil and natural gas are affected by a variety of factors that are beyond our control, including changes in the global supply and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, the level of global oil and natural gas exploration activity and inventories, the price, availability and consumer acceptance of alternative fuel sources, the availability of refining capacity, technological advances affecting energy consumption, weather conditions, speculative activity, civil or political unrest in oil and natural gas producing regions, financial and commercial market uncertainty, and worldwide economic conditions. In addition to factors affecting the price of oil and natural gas generally, the prices we receive for our production are affected by factors specific to us and to the local markets where the production occurs. Pricing can be influenced by, among other things, local or regional supply and demand factors (such as refinery or pipeline capacity issues, trade restrictions and governmental regulations) and the terms of our sales contracts. The prices we receive for our production are often at a discount to the relevant benchmark prices on NYMEX. A negative difference between the benchmark price and the 31 Table of Contents price received is called a differential. The differential may vary significantly due to market conditions, the quality and location of production, and other factors. Due to increasing production from the Williston Basin in recent years and limits to the available takeaway capacity and related infrastructure, the differential applicable to oil produced there has been significant. We cannot accurately predict future differentials, and increases in differentials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, the difficulty involved in predicting the differential also makes it more difficult for us to effectively hedge our production. Oil and natural gas exploration, exploitation and development activities may not be successful and could result in a complete loss of a significant investment. Exploration, exploitation and development activities are subject to many risks. For example, new wells we drill may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically. In addition, a productive well may become commercially unproductive in the event that water or other deleterious substances are encountered which impair or prevent the commercial production of oil and natural gas from the well. Similarly, decline rates from a productive well may exceed our estimates and may cause the well to become uneconomic. We engage in exploratory drilling, which increases these risks. Drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts as a result of dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then-realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. Moreover, even profitable development activity may be less successful than we, investors or analysts expect, potentially resulting in a decline in the market value of our securities. Cost-related risks are exacerbated in the Williston Basin because the drilling and completion of a well there generally costs significantly more than a typical onshore conventional well. Further, our exploration, exploitation and development activities may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including: title problems; problems in delivery of our oil and natural gas to market; pressure or irregularities in geological formations; equipment failures or accidents; adverse weather conditions; reductions in oil and natural gas prices; compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements, including with respect to permitting issues; and costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment, qualified personnel and services. We expect that nearly all of the wells we drill in FY2015 will be drilled horizontally and will be hydraulically fractured. When drilling horizontal wells, the risks we face include, but are not limited to, failing to place our wellbore in the desired target producing zone, not staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, failing to run casing the entire length of the wellbore and not being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore. Risks we face while completing such wells include, but are not limited to, not being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, failing to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations, and not successfully cleaning out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage. Because of the cost typically associated with this type of well, 32 Table of Contents unsuccessful exploration or development activity affecting even a small number of these wells could have a significant impact on our results of operations. Our planned operations will require additional capital that may not be available. Our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures to maintain currently producing wells, to make the acquisitions and conduct the exploration, exploitation and development activities necessary to replace our reserves, and to pay expenses and to satisfy our other obligations. In recent years, we have chosen to pursue projects that required capital expenditures substantially in excess of cash flow from operations. That fact has made us dependent on external financing to a greater degree than many of our competitors. In addition, our existing asset base is small compared to many of our public company competitors, which may make financing more difficult. We anticipate that we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves in the future and for future drilling programs. We cannot assure you that our cash flows from operations and other available sources of financing will be adequate for us to implement our capital plans and to satisfy our debt-related and other obligations. Debt or equity financing may not be available in a timely manner, on terms acceptable to us or at all. Moreover, future activities may require us to alter our capitalization significantly. Our inability to access sufficient capital for our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or the relevant underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantity and present value of our reserves. The reserve data included in this report represent estimates only. Estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process that requires interpretations of available technical data and various estimates, including estimates based upon assumptions relating to economic factors, such as future commodity prices, production costs, severance and excise taxes and availability of capital, estimates of required capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, and the assumed effect of governmental regulation. The assumptions underlying our estimates of our proved reserves could prove to be inaccurate, and any significant inaccuracy could materially affect, among other things, future estimates of our reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to our properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of our future net cash flows. At January 31, 2014, approximately 58% of our estimated net remaining proved reserves (Mboe) were proved undeveloped, or PUDs. Estimation of PUD reserves is almost always based on analogy to existing wells as contrasted with the performance data used to estimate producing reserves. Recovery of PUD reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Additionally, SEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, PUD reserves may be recorded only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This rule has limited and may continue to limit our potential to record additional PUD reserves as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write-down our PUDs if we do not drill those wells within the required five-year time frame. Our PUD reserve estimates as of January 31, 2014 reflected our plans to make significant capital expenditures to convert our PUDs into proved developed reserves, including currently estimated expenditures of approximately $505.4 million during the five years ending on January 31, 2019. You should be aware that this estimate of our development costs may not be accurate, development may not occur as scheduled, and results may not be as estimated. If we choose not to develop PUDs, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them, we will be required to remove the associated volumes from our reported proved reserves. 33 Table of Contents You should not assume that the present values referred to in this report represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The timing and success of development activities and related expenses, each of which is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, will affect the timing and amount of actual future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value. In addition, our PV-10 and Standardized Measure estimates are based on assumed future prices and costs. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the assumed prices and costs. Further, the effect of derivative instruments is not reflected in these assumed prices. Also, the use of a 10% discount factor to calculate PV-10 and Standardized Measure may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor given actual interest rates and risks to which our business, and the oil and natural gas industry in general, are subject. Acquisitions may prove to be unprofitable because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities. Our recent growth is due in large part to acquisitions of undeveloped leasehold and the drilling and completion of productive wells. We expect acquisitions will also contribute to our future growth. Successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, title issues and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. In addition, many of these factors are subject to change and are beyond our control. In particular, the prices of and markets for oil and natural gas products may change from those anticipated at the time such assessments are made. In connection with our assessment of a potential acquisition, we perform a review of the acquired properties that we believe is generally consistent with industry practices. However, such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems, and generally will not involve a review of seismic data or independent environmental testing. In addition, our review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their capabilities and deficiencies, including any structural, subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise. As a result, we may assume unknown liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner and feasibility of doing business and limit our growth. Our operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to exploration for, and the exploitation, development, production and transportation of, oil and natural gas, as well as environmental, safety and other matters. Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations, may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations applicable to us include those relating to: land use restrictions; drilling bonds and other financial responsibility requirements; spacing of wells; emissions into the air; unitization and pooling of properties; habitat and endangered species protection, reclamation and remediation; the management and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials; the use of underground storage tanks; 34 Table of Contents transportation and drilling permits; the use of underground injection wells; safety precautions; hydraulic fracturing (including limitations on the use of this technology); the prevention of oil spills; the closure of production facilities; operational reporting; and taxation and royalties. Under these laws and regulations, we could be liable for: personal injuries; property and natural resource damages; releases or discharges of hazardous materials; well reclamation costs; oil spill clean-up costs; other remediation and clean-up costs; plugging and abandonment costs; governmental sanctions, such as fines and penalties; and other environmental damages. These regulations have been changed frequently in the past and, in general, these changes have imposed more stringent requirements that have increased operating costs and required capital expenditures to remain in compliance. For example, in 2012, North Dakota, the primary state in which we conduct operations, amended its regulations to impose more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, the disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and more rigorous regulation of pits. Any noncompliance with these laws and regulations could subject us to material administrative, civil, or criminal penalties or other liabilities, including suspension or termination of operations. Some environmental laws and regulations impose strict liability, under which we could be exposed to liability for clean-up costs and other damages for conduct that was not negligent and was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of prior owners or operators of properties we have acquired or other third parties, including, in some circumstances, operators of properties in which we have an interest and parties that provide transportation services for us. Similarly, some environmental laws and regulations impose joint and several liability, under which we could be held responsible for more than our proportionate share of liability for site remediation or other obligations, and potentially the entire obligation, even where other parties also have liability. In addition, we may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations, for example by installing and maintaining pollution control devices. Further, our plugging and abandonment obligations will be substantial and may exceed our estimates. Our operations could also be adversely affected by environmental and other laws and regulations that require us to obtain permits before commencing drilling or other activities. Even when permits are granted in a timely manner, they may be subject to conditions that impose delays on a project, increase its costs or reduce its benefits to us. In addition, any changes in applicable laws, regulations and/or administrative policies or practices may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and on our profitability. The laws, regulations, 35 Table of Contents policies or current administrative practices of any government body, organization or regulatory agency in the United States or any other jurisdiction in which we operate may be changed, applied or interpreted in a manner that could fundamentally alter our ability to carry on our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. Caliber's operations may be subject to additional regulatory risks. For example, in the future its pipelines may be subject to siting, public necessity, rate and service regulations by FERC or various state regulatory bodies, depending upon jurisdiction. FERC generally regulates the transportation of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil in interstate commerce. FERC's actions in any of these areas or modifications of its current regulations could adversely impact Caliber's ability to compete for business, the costs it incurs in its operations, the construction of new facilities or its ability to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines. Other laws and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities could have similar effects on Caliber's operations. For example, North Dakota adopted new regulations in December 2013 requiring operators to submit data to the state to track construction and reclamation of pipelines, and to track pipeline locations for surface owners. Hydraulic fracturing has recently come under increased scrutiny and could be the subject of further regulation, which could impact the timing and cost of development. As discussed above in Item 1. BusinessGovernmental RegulationRegulation of Hydraulic Fracturing, the regulatory landscape regarding hydraulic fracturing remains in flux. Depending on the legislation or regulations that ultimately may be adopted, exploration and production activities that employ hydraulic fracturing could be restricted or subject to additional regulation and permitting requirements. Individually or collectively, such new legislation or regulation could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional burdens that could increase the costs and delay or curtail the development of unconventional oil and natural gas resources from shale formations that are not commercially viable without hydraulic fracturing. As a result, such legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have a limited operating history. We have a limited operating history conducting oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. The history of RockPile and Caliber is more limited, as both of those entities began conducting operations in FY2013. Each of these businesses will be subject to all the risks inherent in the establishment of a developing enterprise and the uncertainties arising from the absence of a significant operating history. We may be unable to operate on a profitable basis. We are in the early stage of our development plan, and potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by enterprises in this stage. If our business plan is not successful and we are not able to operate profitably, investors may lose some or all of their investment. The results of our planned drilling in the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations, each an emerging play with limited drilling and production history, are subject to more uncertainties than drilling programs in more established formations and may not meet our expectations for production. Part of our drilling strategy to maximize recoveries from the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations involves the drilling of horizontal wells using completion techniques that have proven to be successful for other companies in these and other shale formations. Our experience with horizontal drilling in the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations, like that of the industry in general, is limited. The ultimate success of these drilling and completion strategies and techniques in these formations will be better evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and longer-term production profiles are established. In addition, the decline rates in these formations may be higher than in other areas and in other shale formations, making overall production difficult to estimate until our experience in these 36 Table of Contents formations increases. Accordingly, the results of our future drilling in the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations are more uncertain than drilling results in some other formations with established reserves and longer production histories. Further, access to adequate gathering systems or pipeline takeaway capacity and the availability of drilling rigs and other services may be more challenging in resource constrained plays such as the Williston Basin. If our drilling results are less favorable than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, lack of access to gathering systems and takeaway capacity or otherwise, or oil and natural gas prices decline, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate, and we could incur material write-downs of properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline. The lack of availability or high cost of drilling rigs, fracture stimulation crews, equipment, supplies, insurance, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget. Our industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, fracture stimulation crews, equipment, supplies, key infrastructure, insurance or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies are substantially greater. In addition, the demand for, and wage rates of, qualified crews rise as the number of active rigs and completion fleets in service increases. If increasing levels of exploration and production result from strong commodity prices, the demand for oilfield services will likely rise, and the costs of these services will likely increase, while the quality of these services may suffer. Costs associated with hydraulic fracturing, such as costs relating to water and proppants, may be subject to similar pressures in areas such as the Williston Basin where hydraulic fracturing activities are widespread. Moreover, costs in the Williston Basin generally are high relative to many areas of the country due to its rapid growth in recent years and its distance from major metropolitan areas. We rely on independent experts and technical or operational service providers over whom we may have limited control. We use independent contractors to provide us with technical assistance and services. We rely upon the owners and operators of rigs and drilling equipment, and upon providers of oilfield services, to drill and develop certain of our prospects to production. In addition, we rely upon the services of other third parties to explore or analyze our prospects to determine a method in which the prospects may be developed in a cost-effective manner. Our limited control over the activities and business practices of these operators and service providers, any inability on our part to maintain satisfactory commercial relationships with them or their failure to provide quality services could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our agreements with operators and other joint venture partners, as well as other operational agreements that we may enter into, present a number of challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our agreements with well operators and other joint venture partners, as well as other operational agreements (including agreements with mineral rights owners and suppliers of services, equipment and product transportation), represent a significant portion of our business. In addition, as part of our business strategy, we plan to enter into other similar transactions, some of which may be material. These transactions typically involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including the existence of unknown potential disputes, liabilities or contingencies that arise after entering into these arrangements related to the counterparties to such arrangements. We could experience financial or other setbacks if we encounter unanticipated problems in connection with such transactions, including problems related to execution or integration. Any of these risks could reduce 37 Table of Contents our revenues or increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Unless reserves are replaced as they are produced, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to develop our identified drilling locations as planned. Producing crude oil and natural gas reservoirs are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. The rate of decline may change over time and may exceed our estimates. Our future reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flows and income, are highly dependent on our ability to efficiently develop and exploit our current reserves and to economically find or acquire additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, discover or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. Our failure to do so would adversely affect our future operations, financial condition and results of operations. We have identified a number of well locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These well locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including crude oil prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, midstream constraints, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these factors, we do not know if the numerous potential well locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil or natural gas from these or any other potential well locations. In addition, the number of drilling locations available to us will depend in part on the spacing of wells in our operating areas. An increase in well density in an area could result in additional locations in that area, but a reduced production performance from the area on a per-well basis. Further, certain of the horizontal wells we intend to drill in the future may require pooling of our lease interests with the interests of third parties. If these third parties are unwilling to pool their interests with ours, and we are unable to require such pooling on a timely basis or at all, this may limit the total locations we can drill. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified. Further, our inventory of drilling projects includes locations in addition to those that we currently classify as proved. The development of and results from these additional projects are more uncertain than those relating to proved locations. Most of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive, which could have a material adverse effect on our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income. Most of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas. In addition, many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive within specified periods of time, and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells, we could lose our rights under such leases. We intend to develop our leasehold acreage by implementing our exploration and development plan, but the funds needed to do so may not be available and our exploration and development activities may be unsuccessful. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our future cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage. 38 Table of Contents No assurance can be given that defects in our title to oil and natural gas interests do not exist. It is often not possible to determine title to an oil and natural gas interest without incurring substantial expense. The title review processes we have conducted with respect to certain interests we have acquired may not have been sufficient to detect all potential defects, and we have not conducted such a process with respect to all our properties. If a title defect does exist, it is possible that we may lose all or a portion of our interest in the properties to which the title defect relates. Our actual interest in certain properties may therefore vary from our records. We may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could adversely affect our business plan, financial condition and results of operations. Growth in accordance with our business plan, if achieved, will place a significant strain on our financial, accounting, technical, operational and management resources. As we expand our activities and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate, there will be additional demands on these resources. Our vertical integration strategy effectively increases the variety of these projects, which adds complexity and may require additional resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers, geologists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan. We have broad discretion in the use of our net proceeds from our recent public offering and may not use them effectively. Our management has broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from our public equity offering completed in August 2013. Our management may spend the proceeds of the public offering in ways that do not improve our results of operations or increase the value of our common stock. Our stockholders may not agree with our management's choices in allocating and spending the net proceeds. These decisions could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business and cause the price of our common stock to decline. We may not realize the benefits of integrating acquired properties. The integration into our operations of oil and natural gas properties acquired in August 2013, as well as any future acquired properties, is a significant undertaking and requires significant resources, as well as attention from our management team. We could encounter difficulties in the integration process, such as the need to revisit assumptions about reserves, future production, revenues, capital expenditures and operating costs, including synergies, the loss of commercial relationships or the need to address unanticipated liabilities. If we cannot successfully integrate acquired properties into our business, we may fail to realize the expected benefits of those acquisitions. We may be unable to successfully acquire additional leasehold interests or other oil and natural gas properties, which may inhibit our ability to grow our production. Acquisitions of leasehold interests or other oil and natural gas properties have been an important element of our business, and we will continue to pursue acquisitions in the future. In recent years, we have pursued and consummated leasehold or other property acquisitions that have provided us opportunities to expand our acreage position and grow our production. Although we regularly engage in discussions and submit proposals regarding leasehold interests or other oil and natural gas properties, suitable acquisitions may not be available in the future on reasonable terms. 39 Table of Contents Our method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairments. We follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties. Accordingly, all costs associated with the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties, including costs of undeveloped leasehold, geological and geophysical expenses, dry holes, leasehold equipment and other costs directly related to acquisition, exploration and development activities, are capitalized. Capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties also include estimated asset retirement costs recorded based on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation when incurred. The capitalized costs plus future development and dismantlement costs are depleted and charged to operations using the equivalent unit-of-production method based on proved oil and natural gas reserves as determined annually by an experienced petroleum engineer on our staff and audited by an independent petroleum engineering firm and determined in the interim quarterly periods by an experienced petroleum engineer on our staff. To the extent that such capitalized costs, net of their accumulated depreciation and amortization, exceed the sum of (i) the present value (discounting at 10% per annum) of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves and (ii) the capitalized costs of unevaluated properties (both adjusted for income tax effects), such excess costs are charged to operations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We recognized such impairment expense in FY2012. Once incurred, such a write-down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date, even if oil or natural gas prices substantially increase or if estimated proved reserves substantially increase. Although we had no impairments in FY2013 or FY2014, there can be no assurance that that we will not recognize impairment expense in future periods. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls that, if not properly corrected, could result in material misstatement in our financial statements. On April 17, 2013, our board of directors approved the audit committee's and management's recommendation that we file Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A (the "FY2013 Amendment") to amend and restate our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended October 31, 2012, which was filed with the SEC on December 10, 2012. The FY2013 Amendment included an error correction that eliminates $1.8 million of previously recognized pressure pumping income, pursuant to recognition exception rules set forth in Regulation S-X Rule 4-10(c)(6)(iv), as further discussed in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013. Accordingly, we identified a material weakness in our controls over the accounting for pressure pumping income. Our control for the accounting for service income was not designed to consider all of the relevant accounting literature applicable to service income, including related party considerations as described in the Regulation S-X Rule 4-10(c)(6)(iv). This material weakness resulted in a material error in our accounting for pressure pumping income and a restatement of our previously issued quarterly financial statements for the three months ended October 31, 2012. As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of January 31, 2013. Accordingly, we identified a material weakness in our controls over the accounting for pressure pumping income. Our control for the accounting for service income was not designed to consider all of the relevant accounting literature applicable to service income, including related party considerations as described in the Regulation S-X Rule 4-10(c)(6)(iv). This material weakness resulted in a material error in our accounting for pressure pumping income and a restatement of our previously issued quarterly financial statements for the three months ended October 31, 2012. As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of January 31, 2013. On April 13, 2014, our board of directors approved the audit committee's and management's recommendation that we file Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A (the "2014 Amendment") to amend 40 Table of Contents and restate our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended October 31, 2013, which we intend to file as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this annual report. The FY2014 Amendment is expected to include an error correction to recognize the fair value of equity investment derivatives for the trigger units and warrants that the Company holds in Caliber in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820Fair Value Measurement and ASC 815Derivatives and Hedging, as further discussed in Item 8 of this Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. Consequently, we identified a material weakness in our controls over the accounting for equity investment derivatives. Our control for the accounting for equity investment derivatives was not designed to consider all of the relevant accounting literature applicable to our Caliber trigger units and warrants. This material weakness resulted in a material error in our accounting for equity investment derivatives, and we expect to restate our previously issued quarterly financial statements for the three months ended October 31, 2013. As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of January 31, 2014. We are in the process of implementing system and procedural changes to prevent these issues from recurring in FY2015. If we are not able to remedy the control deficiencies in a timely manner, or if other deficiencies arise in the future, we may be unable to provide holders of our securities with required financial information in a timely and reliable manner and we could be required to restate or correct our financial statements in the future. We cannot control the activities on the properties we do not operate and are unable to ensure their proper operation and profitability. Other companies operated properties represent a significant portion of our production. We have limited ability to exercise influence over, or control the risks associated with, operations of our non-operated properties. The failure of an operator of our non-operated wells to adequately perform operations, an operator's breach of the applicable agreements, or an operator's failure to act in our best interests could reduce our production and revenues. The success and timing of drilling and development activities on properties operated by others depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the operator's expertise and financial resources, inclusion of other participants in drilling wells, and use of technology. In addition, we could be adversely affected by our lack of control over the timing and amount of capital expenditures related to non-operated properties. Our lack of geographic diversification will increase the risk of an investment in us. Our current business focus is on the oil and natural gas industry in a limited number of properties in North Dakota and Montana. RockPile and Caliber also focus on the Williston Basin areas of those states. Larger companies have the ability to manage their risk by diversification. However, we currently lack diversification in terms of the geographic scope of our business. As a result, we will likely be impacted more acutely by factors affecting our industry or the regions in which we operate than we would if our business were more diversified, and this increases our risk profile. We face strong competition from other companies. We encounter competition from other companies involved in the oil and natural gas industry in all areas of our operations, including the acquisition of exploratory prospects and proven properties. Our competitors include major integrated oil and natural gas companies and numerous independent oil and natural gas companies. Many of our competitors have been engaged in the oil and natural gas business much longer than we have and possess substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we do. These companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies 41 Table of Contents may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry, particularly in the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations on which we focus. Such competitors may also be in a better position to secure oilfield services and equipment on a timely basis or on more favorable terms. We may not be able to conduct our operations, evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions successfully in this highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Similarly, the market for RockPile's services and products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance and services. If RockPile is not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products and to implement commercially competitive services in a timely manner in response to changes in technology, its business could be materially and adversely affected. Each of our businesses has a relatively high degree of customer concentration, which could increase our risks with respect to competition. The sale of our oil and natural gas production depends in part on gathering, transportation and processing facilities and services. Any limitation in the availability of, or our access to, those facilities or services would interfere with our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce and could adversely impact our drilling program, cash flows and results of operations. We deliver oil and natural gas that may ultimately flow through gathering, processing and pipeline systems that we do not own. The amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce and sell is subject to the accessibility, availability, proximity and capacity of these gathering, processing and pipeline systems. In particular, natural gas produced from the Bakken Shale has a high Btu content that requires natural gas processing to remove the natural gas liquids before it can be redelivered into transmission pipelines. Industry-wide in the Williston Basin, there is currently a shortage of natural gas gathering and processing capacity. Such shortage has limited our ability to sell our natural gas production. As a result, the majority of our natural gas from the Williston Basin wells to date has been flared. In addition, the use of alternative forms of transportation for oil production, such as trucks or rail, involves risks as well. For example, recent and well-publicized accidents involving trains delivering crude oil could result in increased levels of regulation and transportation costs. The lack of available capacity in any of the gathering, processing and pipeline systems we use could result in our inability to realize the full economic potential of our production or in a reduction of the price offered for our production. Additionally, if we were prohibited from flaring natural gas due to environmental or other regulations, then we would be forced to shut-in producing wells, which would also adversely impact our drilling program. Any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities or any changes in regulatory requirements affecting flaring activities, could harm our business and, in turn, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, weather conditions or natural disasters, actions by companies doing business in one or more of the areas in which we operate, or labor disputes may impair the distribution of oil and/or natural gas and in turn diminish our financial condition or ability to conduct our operations. A U.S. or global economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Any or all of the following may occur if a crisis arises in the global financial and securities markets and an economic downturn results: An economic slowdown could lead to lower demand for oil and natural gas by individuals and industries, which in turn could result in lower oil and natural gas prices. 42 Table of Contents The lenders under our revolving credit facilities may become more restrictive in their lending practices or unable or unwilling to fund their commitments, which would limit our access to capital to fund our capital expenditures and operations. This would limit our ability to generate revenues as well as limit our projected production and reserves growth. TUSA's credit facility requires the lenders to re-determine our borrowing base periodically. The re-determinations are based on our proved reserves, which reflect price assumptions that our lenders require us to use to calculate reserves pursuant to the credit facility. The lenders could reduce their price assumptions used to determine reserves for calculating our borrowing base due to lower commodities and futures prices, which could result in the reduction of our borrowing base and funds available to borrow. We may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing, which would require us to limit our capital expenditures and other spending. Financing costs may significantly increase as lenders may be reluctant to lend without receiving higher fees and spreads. The losses incurred by financial institutions as well as the insolvency of some financial institutions could heighten the risk that a counterparty to our hedge arrangements would default on its obligations. A failure of one or more counterparties to our hedging transactions to meet their obligations to us could reduce our revenues from hedges at a time when we are also receiving a lower price for our natural gas and oil sales. As a result, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Bankruptcies of purchasers of our oil and natural gas could lead to the delay or failure of us to receive the revenues from those sales. A generally reduced availability of capital would likely lead to a decreased demand for the services provided by RockPile and Caliber. Seasonal weather conditions and other factors could adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities. Our operations could be adversely affected by weather conditions. In the Williston Basin, drilling and other oil and natural gas activities cannot be conducted as effectively during the winter months. Severe weather conditions limit and may temporarily halt operations during such conditions. Wet weather and spring thaw may make the ground unstable. Consequently, municipalities and state transportation departments enforce road bans that restrict the movement of rigs and other heavy equipment during certain periods, thereby reducing activity levels. Similarly, any drought or other condition resulting in a shortage or the unavailability of adequate supplies of water would impair our ability to conduct hydraulic fracturing operations. These constraints, and resulting shortages or cost increases, could delay or temporarily halt our oil and natural gas operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to retain or recruit qualified managerial, operations and field personnel, we may not be able to continue our operations. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued services of our directors and officers and that of key managerial, operational, land, finance, legal and accounting staff. In order to successfully implement and manage our business plan, we will be dependent upon, among other things, successfully recruiting qualified managerial and field personnel having experience in required aspects of our business. Competition for qualified individuals is intense. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain existing employees or that we will be able to find, attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms. 43 Table of Contents Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation. President Obama has proposed changes to U.S. tax laws that would eliminate certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, including by (i) repealing the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas wells, (ii) eliminating current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) eliminating the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (iv) extending the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of this legislation or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could increase the cost of exploration and development of natural gas and oil resources. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce, while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for, or responding to, those effects. The EPA has issued a notice of finding and determination that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, or GHGs, present an endangerment to human health and the environment, which allows the EPA to regulate GHG emissions under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. The EPA has begun to implement GHG-related reporting and permitting rules. Similarly, the U.S. Congress has considered and may in the future consider "cap and trade" legislation that would establish an economy-wide cap on GHG emissions in the United States and would require most sources of GHG emissions to obtain GHG emission "allowances" corresponding to their annual emissions of GHGs. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs would likely require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our production. Canada, where we also hold oil and natural gas leases, is also implementing laws concerning GHG emissions. These or future federal, state, regional or international monitoring or regulatory requirements relating to climate change could require us to obtain permits or allowances for our GHG emissions, install new pollution controls, increase our operational costs, limit our operations or adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. See Item 1. BusinessGovernmental RegulationAir Emissions and Climate Change for further discussion. Many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting services or infrastructure provided to us by other parties. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change and, as a result, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity risks and other disruptions. As an oil and natural gas producer, we face various security threats, including possible attempts by third parties to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, or to render data or systems unusable, through unauthorized computer access; threats to the safety of our employees; and threats to the security of our infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines. There can be no assurance that the procedures and controls we use to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to them will be sufficient in preventing them from materializing. If 44 Table of Contents any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Aboriginal claims could have an adverse effect on us and our operations. Aboriginal peoples have claimed aboriginal title and rights to portions of Montana where we operate. We are not aware that any claims have been made in respect to our property or assets in Montana or North Dakota. However, if a claim arose and was successful, it could have an adverse effect on us and our business operations, financial conditions or prospects. We do not insure against all potential operating risk. We might incur substantial losses from, and be subject to substantial liability claims for, uninsured or underinsured risks related to our operations. Our operations are subject to all the risks normally incident to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, hydraulic fracturing and the provision of related services including: environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other substances into the environment, including groundwater; abnormally pressured formations; fires and explosions; personal injuries and death; regulatory investigations and penalties; well blowouts; pipeline failures and ruptures; casing collapse; mechanical and operational problems that affect production; and natural disasters. We do not maintain insurance against all such risks. We generally elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Constraints in the supply of, prices for, and availability of transportation of raw materials can have a material adverse effect on RockPile's business. High levels of demand for, or a shortage of, raw materials used in hydraulic fracturing operations, such as proppants, can trigger constraints in RockPile's supply chain of those raw materials, particularly where it has a relationship with a single supplier for a particular resource. Many of the raw materials essential to its business require the use of rail, storage, and trucking services to transport the materials to its jobsites. These services, particularly during times of high demand, may cause delays in the arrival of, or otherwise constrain its supply of, raw materials. These constraints could have a material adverse effect on RockPile's business. In addition, price increases imposed by its vendors for such raw materials and the inability to pass these increases through to its customers could have a material adverse effect on its business. Our other operations may be similarly adversely affected by shortages of these raw materials. 45 Table of Contents Growing Caliber's business by constructing new pipelines and other infrastructure subjects it to construction risks and will require it to obtain rights of way at a reasonable cost. Such projects may not be profitable if costs are higher, or demand is less, than expected. One of the ways we intend to grow Caliber's business is through the construction of pipelines, treatment/processing facilities and other midstream infrastructure. The construction of this infrastructure requires significant amounts of capital, which may exceed our expectations, and will involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties, and stringent, lengthy and occasionally unreasonable or impractical federal, state and local permitting, consent, or authorization requirements. As a result, new infrastructure may not be constructed as scheduled or as originally designed, which may require redesign and additional equipment, relocations of facilities or rerouting of pipelines, which in turn could subject Caliber to additional capital costs, additional expenses or penalties and may adversely affect Caliber's operations. In addition, the coordination and monitoring of these projects requires skilled and experienced labor. Agreements with Caliber's producer customers may contain substantial financial penalties and give the producers the right to repurchase certain assets and terminate their contracts if construction deadlines are not achieved. Moreover, Caliber's revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if Caliber builds a new pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and Caliber may not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project, if at all. In addition, the construction of pipelines and other infrastructure may require Caliber to obtain rights-of-way or other property rights prior to construction. Caliber may be unable to obtain such rights-of-way or other property rights at a reasonable cost. If the cost of obtaining new or renewing rights-of-way or other property rights increases, it would adversely affect Caliber's operations. Furthermore, Caliber may have limited or no commitments from customers relating to infrastructure projects prior to their construction. If Caliber constructs facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production or satisfy anticipated market demand that does not materialize, the facilities may not operate as planned or may not be used at all. Caliber may rely on estimates of proved reserves in deciding to construct new pipelines and facilities, and these estimates may prove to be inaccurate because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves. As a result, new infrastructure projects may be unprofitable. Certain stockholders have significant influence on our major corporate decisions, including control over some matters that require stockholder approval, and could take actions that could be adverse to stockholders. In connection with the issuance and sale to NGP Triangle Holdings, LLC ("NGP") in July 2012 of our convertible note with an initial principal amount of $120.0 million (the "Convertible Note"), we entered into an Investment Agreement with NGP and its parent company. Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, NGP is entitled to designate one director to our board of directors until the occurrence of a "Termination Event" (as defined in the Investment Agreement). The Investment Agreement further provides that, for so long as at least 50% of the original principal amount is outstanding and held by NGP, we will not take certain actions without the prior written consent of NGP. In addition, pursuant to the Convertible Note, for so long as at least 50% of the original principal amount is outstanding and held by NGP, we have agreed to (i) obtain the prior written consent of NGP before submitting certain resolutions or matters to a vote of the stockholders, or (ii) require the approval of stockholders as would be required to approve such resolution or matter if the then-outstanding Convertible Note held by NGP had been converted into shares of common stock immediately prior to the record date for such meeting of stockholders and NGP had voted all of such shares of common stock against such resolution or matter. The Convertible Note is convertible into shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of $8.00 per share, which, based on the initial principal amount, would allow the Convertible Note to be converted into 15,000,000 shares of common stock plus any shares issuable upon the conversion of accrued interest. As a result of the foregoing, NGP has significant influence 46 Table of Contents over us, our management, our policies and, under both the Investment Agreement, as amended, and following conversion of the Convertible Note as a significant stockholder, certain matters requiring stockholder approval. In March 2013, we sold to two affiliates of NGP an aggregate of 9,300,000 shares of our common stock in a private placement (the "NGP Private Placement"). In connection with the NGP Private Placement, we entered into an amendment to the Investment Agreement to modify the definition of "Termination Event," thereby strengthening NGP's board seat designation right. As of April 1, 2014, NGP's affiliates collectively held approximately 11% of our outstanding common stock. If NGP had fully converted the Convertible Note on April 1, 2014, NGP and its affiliates would have collectively held approximately 25% of our outstanding shares of common stock on that date. Further, in August 2013, we sold to ActOil Bakken, LLC ("ActOil") 11,350,000 shares of our common stock in a private placement. As of April 1, 2014, ActOil held approximately 13% of our outstanding shares of common stock. The interests of NGP and its affiliates, including in NGP's capacity as a creditor, and ActOil may differ from the interests of our other stockholders, and the ability of ActOil and NGP and its affiliates to influence certain of our major corporate decisions may harm the market price of our common stock by delaying, deferring or preventing transactions that are in the best interest of all stockholders or discouraging third-party investors. The cost of servicing our debt could adversely affect our business. In addition, our debt agreements have substantial restrictions and financial covenants that could adversely affect our business. We have outstanding indebtedness under TUSA's and RockPile's credit facilities and our Convertible Note. A significant portion of our cash flows will be required to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness, and we may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or have future borrowing capacity available, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. Our ability to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness and to satisfy our other obligations will depend upon our future operating performance and financial condition and the availability of refinancing indebtedness, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our revolving credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. A substantial decrease in our operating cash flows or an increase in our expenses could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements and could require us to modify our operations, including by curtailing our exploration and drilling programs, selling assets, refinancing all or a portion of our existing debt, or obtaining additional financing. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In the absence of adequate cash from operations and other available capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate these dispositions for fair market value, in a timely manner or at all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service or other obligations then due. The terms of certain of our debt agreements require us to comply with specified financial covenants and ratios. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flows from operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants under the agreements could result in a default under those agreements, which could cause all of our existing indebtedness to be immediately due and payable. 47 Table of Contents In addition to making it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt and other obligations, our indebtedness could limit our ability to respond to changes in the markets in which we operate and otherwise limit our activities. For example, our indebtedness, and the terms of agreements governing that indebtedness, could increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and impair our ability to withstand sustained declines in commodity prices and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. TUSA's revolving credit facility limits the amount it can borrow to a borrowing base amount determined by the lenders. Outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base may be required to be repaid immediately, and we may not have the financial resources in the future to make those repayments. Our inability to borrow additional funds under TUSA's revolving credit facility, or a requirement to repay borrowings in excess of a reduced borrowing base, could adversely affect our operations and our financial results. Our limited partner interest in the Caliber joint venture may be diluted. In October 2012, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours entered into a joint venture to provide crude oil, natural gas and water transportation and related services to us and third-parties primarily in the Williston Basin. In connection with its investment in the joint venture entity, our subsidiary received a 30% percent limited partner interest, as well as warrants to purchase additional limited partner interests at specified prices, trigger units, and trigger warrants. Based on anticipated funding commitments by the joint venture partners, full exercise and vesting of our warrants, trigger units, and trigger warrants would cause our ownership to increase to a 50% limited partner interest. In September 2013, our joint venture partner committed to providing an anticipated additional $80.0 million to the joint venture in return for 8,000,000 limited partner units. The associated amendment to the joint venture agreement will also result in our 4,000,000 trigger units vesting and converting to limited partner units. Our joint venture partner and our subsidiary will receive the 8,000,000 and 4,000,000 limited partner units, respectively, on the earlier of the in-service date of Caliber's expansion system and June 30, 2014. Following the conversion of our 4,000,000 trigger units and the issuance of 8,000,000 limited partner units to our joint venture partner, our limited partner interest in the joint venture is expected to increase to 32%. We will be unable to increase our limited partner interest above 32% absent a cashless exercise of our warrants or a direct capital outlay to exercise our warrants or commit additional capital. Further, if the joint venture partner makes a partnership approved capital contribution and we choose not to invest additional capital in the joint venture, or if the joint venture partner exercises its warrants and we do not exercise our warrants, we would be diluted below our 32% limited partner interest. Our derivative activities could result in financial losses or reduced income, or could limit our potential gains from increases in prices. We use derivatives for a portion of our crude oil production to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in prices of crude oil and to achieve a more predictable cash flow. These arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when sales are different than expected, when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative agreement and actual prices that we receive, or if the counterparty to the derivative contract were to default on its contractual obligations. In addition, derivative arrangements may limit the benefit from increases in the price for crude oil, and they may also require the use of our resources to meet cash margin requirements. Since we do not designate our derivatives as hedges, we do not currently qualify for use of hedge accounting; therefore, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in our statements of operations, and our net income is subject to greater volatility than it would be if our derivative instruments qualified for hedge 48 Table of Contents accounting. For instance, if the price of crude oil rises significantly, it could result in significant non-cash charges each quarter, which could have a material negative effect on our net income. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposes restrictions on the use and trading of certain derivatives, including energy derivatives. The nature and scope of those restrictions is in the process of being determined in significant part through implementing regulations adopted by the SEC, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and other regulators. If, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act or its implementing regulations, capital or margin requirements or other limitations relating to our commodity derivative activities are imposed, this could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our hedging strategy. In particular, a requirement to post cash collateral in connection with our derivative positions would likely make it impracticable to implement our current hedging strategy. In addition, requirements and limitations imposed on our derivative counterparties could increase the costs of pursuing our hedging strategy. Unrelated to our hedging activities with respect to crude oil prices, we hold trigger units and warrants in Caliber that are classified as derivatives. For so long as such trigger units and warrants remain outstanding, we will be required to estimate their fair market value on a quarterly basis. We currently use a modified market approach and Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the trigger units and warrants, respectively. The associated models are based on several assumptions about future events. While we believe that our models and underlying assumptions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the assumptions will ultimately prove to be accurate or that our models are the best models for valuing the derivatives. If the models and underlying assumptions are flawed, then our accounting for such derivative investments may not reflect their true value. We have restated our financial statements in the past and may be required to do so in the future. We have restated or corrected certain financial information in the past, including by issuing restated financial information for the fiscal quarters ended April 30, 2007, July 31, 2007 and October 31, 2007, for the year ended January 31, 2012, and for the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2012. We also expect to issue restated financial information for the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2013 following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves making estimates, judgments, interpretations and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and income. These estimates, judgments, interpretations and assumptions are often inherently imprecise or uncertain, and any necessary revisions to prior estimates, judgments, interpretations or assumptions could lead to further restatements. Our vertical integration strategy and midstream joint venture investment create certain accounting issues relating to the relationship of our various businesses that are complex, increasing the risk that we may have to restate or correct financial disclosures in the future. Any such restatement or correction may be highly time consuming, may require substantial attention from management and significant accounting costs, may result in adverse regulatory actions by the SEC or NYSE MKT, may result in stockholder litigation, may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile. The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Some of the factors that could negatively affect such share price include: actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations; 49 Table of Contents liquidity; sales of common stock by our stockholders, directors, and officers; changes in oil and natural gas prices; changes in our cash flow from operations or earnings estimates; publication of research reports about us or the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry generally; increases in market interest rates which may increase our cost of capital; changes in applicable laws or regulations, court rulings and enforcement and legal actions; changes in market valuations of similar companies; adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we incur in the future; additions or departures of key management personnel; actions by our stockholders; commencement of or involvement in litigation; news reports relating to trends, concerns, technological or competitive developments, regulatory changes and other related issues in our industry, including adverse public sentiment regarding hydraulic fracturing; speculation in the press or investment community regarding our business; general market and economic conditions; and domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance. Financial markets have recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of securities that have, in many cases, been unrelated to the operating performance, underlying asset values or prospects of the companies issuing those securities. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock may decline even if our results of operations, underlying asset values or prospects improve or remain consistent. In the past, we have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In the past, we have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not expect to declare or pay any cash or other dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock, as we intend to use cash flow generated by operations to develop our business. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, limits imposed by our debt agreements and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. Future sales or other issuances of our common stock could depress the market for our common stock. We may seek to raise additional funds through one or more public or private offerings of our common stock, in amounts and at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the offering. We may also use our common stock as consideration to make acquisitions, including acquisitions of additional leasehold interests. Any issuances of large quantities of our common stock could reduce the price of our common stock. In addition, to the extent that we issue equity securities to fund our business plan, our existing stockholders' ownership will be diluted. 50 Table of Contents Issuances, or the availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the value of our common stock. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future issuances of our common stock, or the availability of common stock for future sales, will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market and the availability of shares for future sale, including by one or more of our significant stockholders or shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options to acquire shares of our common stock, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. This in turn would adversely affect the fair value of our common stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities. The potential future issuance of preferred stock may not enhance stockholder value. Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. Shares of preferred stock could be issued in a financing in which investors purchase preferred stock with rights, preferences and privileges that may be superior to those of our common stock. We could also use the preferred stock for potential strategic transactions, including, among other things, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, business combinations and investments. We cannot provide assurances that any such transactions will be consummated on favorable terms or at all, that they will enhance stockholder value, or that they will not adversely affect our business or the trading price of the common stock. Further, the existence of outstanding preferred stock may make us a less attractive candidate for third party acquirers. Anti-takeover provisions could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult. We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits certain business combination transactions between a corporation and an "interested stockholder" within three years of the time such stockholder became an interested stockholder, absent, in most cases, board or stockholder approval. An "interested stockholder" is any person who, together with affiliates and associates, is the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation, and the term "business combination" encompasses a wide variety of transactions with or caused by an interested stockholder, including mergers, asset sales and other transactions in which the interested stockholder receives a benefit on other than a pro rata basis with other stockholders. Although a corporation can opt out of Section 203 in its certificate of incorporation, we have not done so. Section 203 may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including by discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium being paid over the then-current market price of our common stock and that might be supported by a majority of our stockholders. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.
