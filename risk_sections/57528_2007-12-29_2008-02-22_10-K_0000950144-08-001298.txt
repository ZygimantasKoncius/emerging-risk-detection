Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks that we do not presently know of or currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business or results of operations. Price competition and industry consolidation could adversely impact our results. The sales of most of our products are subject to significant competition primarily through discounting and other price cutting techniques by competitors, many of whom are significantly larger and have greater resources than we do. In addition, there is a continuing consolidation by the major companies in the food industry, which could increase competition. Significant competition increases the possibility that we could lose one or more major customers, lose existing product offerings at customer locations, lose market share, increase expenditures or reduce pricing, which could have an adverse impact on our business or results of operations. Increases in prices or availability of ingredients and other market driven costs could negatively impact our results. Our cost of sales could be adversely impacted by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials. While we often obtain substantial commitments for future delivery of certain raw materials and may engage in limited hedging to reduce the price risk of these raw materials, continuing long-term increases in the costs of raw materials, including cost increases due to the tightening of supply, could adversely affect our cost of sales. Our financial performance could also be adversely impacted by changes in the cost or availability of natural gas and other fuel. While we may engage in limited hedging to reduce the price risk associated with these costs, continuing long-term increases in the cost of natural gas and fuel could adversely impact our cost of sales and selling, marketing and delivery expenses. In 2007 and 2008, our costs for flour and vegetable oils reached unprecedented levels. If we are not able to offset these costs by price increases or other methods, our results could continue to be negatively impacted. Product price increases may negatively impact total revenue. Future price increases, such as those to offset significantly increased ingredient costs, may reduce our overall sales volume, which could reduce total revenues and operating profit. 3 Table of Contents We are exposed to risks resulting from several large customers. We have several large customers that account for a significant portion of our revenue. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 40% of our revenue during 2007 with our largest customer representing 20% of our 2007 revenue. The loss of one or more of our large customers could adversely affect our results of operations. These customers typically do not enter into long-term contracts, but make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance. In addition, these significant customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices related to inventories, product displays, logistics or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from one or more of these customers is significantly reduced or if the cost of complying with customersÂ’ demands is significant. If receivables from one or more of these customers become uncollectible, our results of operations may be adversely impacted. Inability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences may result in decreased demand for products, which could have an adverse impact on our future growth and operating results. Our success depends in part on our ability to respond to current market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers. Changes in consumer preferences, and our failure to anticipate, identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our products, which could in turn cause our operating results to suffer. Implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system could cause interruption to business operations or inability to account for business transactions. We are in the process of implementing a new ERP system. To the extent that there are unexpected issues as a result of the implementation, we may experience interruptions in business operations or may be unable to account for business transactions in a timely manner. Future product recalls or safety concerns could adversely impact our results of operations. We may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated or damaged. We also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products causes injury or illness. A product recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results. We also could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products. Food industry and regulatory factors could adversely affect our revenues and costs. Food industry factors including obesity, nutritional concerns and diet trends could adversely affect our revenues and cost of sales. New or increased government regulation of the food industry, including those related to production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution, could adversely impact our results of operations by increasing production costs or restricting our methods of operation and distribution. Acquisitions and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected. In the normal course of business, we engage in discussions relating to possible acquisitions and divestitures. In the event we enter into such transactions, our financial results may differ from expectations in a given quarter, or over a long-term period. Our future operating results are dependent on our ability to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our existing operations. The inability to effectively integrate the acquired assets or effectively divest of operations, could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. 4 Table of Contents Our ability to execute our strategic initiatives could adversely affect our financial performance. We utilize several operating strategies to increase revenue and improve operating performance. If we are unsuccessful due to our execution, unplanned events or unfavorable market conditions, our financial performance could be adversely affected. We are exposed to interest rate volatility, foreign exchange rate volatility and credit risks. We are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to variable rate credit facilities. We are exposed to foreign exchange rate volatility primarily through the operations of our Canadian subsidiary. This volatility may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we are exposed to certain customer credit risks related to the collection of our accounts receivable. Any business disruption due to natural disasters or catastrophic events could adversely impact our financial performance. If natural disasters or catastrophic events occur in the U.S. or other locations, such events may disrupt manufacturing, labor and other aspects of our business. In the event of such incidents, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected. There are other factors not described above that could also cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statement made by us or on our behalf. Item 1B.
