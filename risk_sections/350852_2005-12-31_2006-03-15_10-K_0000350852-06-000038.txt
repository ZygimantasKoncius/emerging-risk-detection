Item 1A. Risk Factors Interest Rate Risk Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. Our earnings and financial condition are dependent to a large degree upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of interest-rate spreads, meaning the difference between the interest rates earned on loans and investments and the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings, could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including: · The rate of inflation; · The rate of economic growth; · Employment levels; · Monetary policies; and · Instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. Changes in market interest rates will also affect the level of voluntary prepayments on our loans and the receipt of payments on our mortgage-backed securities resulting in the receipt of proceeds that may be reinvested at a lower rate than the loan or mortgage-backed security being prepaid. We originate residential loans for sale and for our portfolio. The origination of loans for sale is designed to meet client financing needs and earn fee income. The origination of loans for sale is highly dependent upon the local real estate market and the level and trend of interest rates. Increasing interest rates may reduce the origination of loans for sale and consequently the fee income we earn. While our commercial banking, construction, and income property business lines are an increasing portion of our activities, high interest rates may reduce our mortgage-banking activities and thereby our income. In contrast, decreasing interest rates have the effect of causing clients to refinance mortgage loans faster than anticipated. This causes the value of assets related to the servicing rights on loans sold to be lower than originally anticipated. If this happens, we may need to write down our servicing assets faster, which would accelerate our expense and lower our earnings. Management considers interest rate risk one of the Corporation’s most significant market risks. Interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates. Consistency of the Corporation’s net interest revenue is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk. The Corporation employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk including the use of an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to changing interest rates. The model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off-balance sheet instruments and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities. Assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model. These assumptions are inherently uncertain, and as a result, the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies. Government Policies Our business may be adversely affected by changes in government policies. The earnings of banks and bank holding companies such as Community Trust Bancorp, Inc. are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the money supply. Among the methods employed by the Federal Reserve Board are open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial and savings banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The banking industry is highly regulated and changes in federal and state banking regulations as well as policies and administration guidelines may affect the Corporation’s practices and growth prospects. Credit Risk Our earnings and reputation may be adversely affected if we fail to effectively manage our credit risk. Originating and underwriting loans are integral to the success of our business. This business requires us to take “credit risk,” which is the risk of losing principal and interest income because borrowers fail to repay loans. Collateral values and the ability of borrowers to repay their loans may be affected at any time by factors such as: · A downturn in the local economies in which we operate or the national economy; · A downturn in one or more of the business sectors in which our customers operate; or · A rapid increase in interest rates. Competition Strong competition within our market area may reduce our ability to attract and retain deposits and originate loans. We face competition both in originating loans and in attracting deposits. Competition in the financial services industry is intense. We compete for clients by offering excellent service and competitive rates on our loans and deposit products. The type of institutions we compete with include commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms. As a result of their size and ability to achieve economies of scale, certain of our competitors offer a broader range of products and services than we offer. In addition, to stay competitive in our markets we may need to adjust the interest rates on our products to match the rates offered by our competitors, which could adversely affect our net interest margin. As a result, our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas while achieving our investment objectives. Economy Our business may be adversely affected by downturns in the local economies on which we depend. Our loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in eastern, northeast, central, and south central Kentucky and southern West Virginia. Our profits depend on providing products and services to clients in these local regions. An increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values, or continued increases in interest rates could weaken the local economies in which we operate. Weakness in our market area could depress our earnings and consequently our financial condition because: · Clients may not want or need our products and services; · Borrowers may not be able to repay their loans; · The value of the collateral securing our loans to borrowers may decline; and · The quality of our loan portfolio may decline. Acquisition Risk We may have difficulty in the future continuing to grow through acquisitions. Due to the consolidation within the banking industry, the number of suitable acquisition targets has decreased and there is intense competition for attractive acquisitions. As a result, the Corporation may experience difficulty in making acquisitions on acceptable terms. Any future acquisitions or mergers by the Corporation or its banking subsidiary are subject to approval by the appropriate federal and state banking regulators. The banking regulators evaluate a number of criteria in making their approval decisions, such as: · Safety and soundness guidelines; · Compliance with all laws including the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations promulgated under such Act or the Exchange Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and all other applicable fair lending laws and other laws relating to discriminatory business practices; and · Anti-competitive concerns with the proposed transaction. If the banking regulators or a commenter on our regulatory application raise concerns about any of these criteria at the time a regulatory application is filed, the banking regulators may deny, delay, or condition their approval of a proposed transaction. We have grown, and intend to continue to grow, through acquisitions of banks and other financial institutions. After these acquisitions, we may experience adverse changes in results of operations of acquired entities, unforeseen liabilities, asset quality problems of acquired entities, loss of key personnel, loss of clients because of change of identity, difficulties in integrating data processing and operational procedures, and deterioration in local economic conditions. These various acquisition risks can be heightened in larger transactions. Integration Risk We may not be able to achieve the expected integration and cost savings from our ongoing bank acquisition activities. We have a long history of acquiring financial institutions and we expect this acquisition activity to continue in the future. Difficulties may arise in the integration of the business and operations of the financial institutions that agree to merge with and into the Corporation and, as a result, we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and synergies that we expect will result from the merger activities. Achieving cost savings is dependent on consolidating certain operational and functional areas, eliminating duplicative positions and terminating certain agreements for outside services. Additional operational savings are dependent upon the integration of the banking businesses of the acquired financial institution with that of the Corporation, including the conversion of the acquired entity’s core operating systems, data systems and products to those of the Corporation and the standardization of business practices. Complications or difficulties in the conversion of the core operating systems, data systems, and products of these other banks to those of the Corporation may result in the loss of clients, damage to our reputation within the financial services industry, operational problems, one-time costs currently not anticipated by us, and/or reduced cost savings resulting from the merger activities. Operational Risk An extended disruption of vital infrastructure could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our operations depend upon, among other things, our infrastructure, including equipment and facilities. Extended disruption of vital infrastructure by fire, power loss, natural disaster, telecommunications failure, computer hacking or viruses, terrorist activity or the domestic and foreign response to such activity, or other events outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole and on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition in particular. Our business recovery plan may not work as intended or may not prevent significant interruption of our operations. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of the Corporation's information systems could damage the Corporation's reputation, result in the loss of customer business, subject the Corporation to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose the Corporation to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operation. Market Risk Community Trust Bancorp, Inc.'s stock price is volatile. The Corporation's stock price has been volatile in the past, and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include: · Actual or anticipated variations in earnings; · Changes in analysts' recommendations or projections; · The Corporation's announcements of developments related to its businesses; · Operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers; · New technology used or services offered by traditional and non-traditional competitors; and · News reports of trends, concerns, and other issues related to the financial services industry. The Corporation's stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to the Corporation's performance. General market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of its common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.

Interest income actually received and included in net income for the period was $0.1 million, leaving $1.3 million of interest income not recognized during the period. Discussion of the Nonaccrual Policy The accrual of interest income on loans is discontinued when the collection of interest and principal in full is not expected. When interest accruals are discontinued, interest income accrued in the current period is reversed and interest income accrued in prior periods is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Any loans past due 90 days or more must be well secured and in the process of collection to continue accruing interest. Potential Problem Loans Interest accrual is discontinued when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions, collateral value, and collection efforts, that the borrower’s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful. Any loan greater than 90 days past due must be well secured and in the process of collection to continue accruing interest.
