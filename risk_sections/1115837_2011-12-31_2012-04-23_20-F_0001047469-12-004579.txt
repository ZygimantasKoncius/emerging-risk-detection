The MGTS stake was held by a wholly owned subsidiary of Comstar. Simultaneously, we received shares representing 11.06% of the total shares outstanding Comstar from MGTS Finance S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of MGTS. We paid Comstar cash consideration of $8.3 million. As a result of these transactions, our ownership stake in Comstar increased to 61.97% as of December 31, 2009. We further increased our ownership stake in Comstar to 70.97% in September 2010 through a voluntary tender offer. See Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements. (3)In June 2010, we increased our direct ownership in TS-Retail OJSC from 25% to 40% for a nominal sum of $1. We subsequently increased our effective ownership interest in TS-Retail to 50.95%, which was achieved through a voluntary tender offer to purchase Comstar's shares in September 2010. In December 2010, as a result of the acquisition of Sistema Telecom, we acquired an additional 45% stake in TS-Retail, thereby increasing our effective ownership interest to 96.0%. In 2011, as a result of our merger with Comstar, we increased our ownership interest in TS-Retail to 100%. (4)MTS acquired 29% of MGTS ordinary shares as part of its acquisition of a 100% stake in CJSC Sistema-Inventure, which directly owned 29% of the ordinary shares of MGTS. Results of Operations Formerly, we had three reportable segments: Russia Mobile, Russia Fixed and Ukraine Mobile. Following our merger with Comstar in 2011 and its complete integration into us, the fixed line business became an inseparable part of the core mobile business. Both the mobile and the fixed line services are now provided through one integrated business unit. This has affected our presentation of information 145 Table of Contents about segments, as our Board and management have identified two reportable segments: Russia and Ukraine. See "Segments." Headquarters expenses are not allocated to any reportable segments and are included in other countries and business activities results of operations ("Other"). See Note 26 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information. Intercompany eliminations presented below consist primarily of sales transactions between segments conducted in the normal course of operations.

The dominant reason for the growth of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, was the large increase in the usage of value-added services by our subscribers, which was mainly attributable to the increase of data traffic due to our active promotion of value-added services, the increase of mobile Internet penetration, active 3G network expansion and the consequent improvement of the quality of value-added services. The increase of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, was also helped by the growth of interconnect revenues, fixed revenues, sales of handsets and accessories. The growth of our interconnect revenues was supported by the overall increase in the volume of traffic from our competitors. The growth of fixed revenues was attributable to the regulatory price increase and the acquisitions of various regional operators throughout the year. The increase in sales of handsets and accessories was stimulated by the continued expansion of our retail operations. Our consolidated mobile subscriber base, excluding subscribers in Turkmenistan, remained stable and amounted to 101.1 million as of December 31, 2011. In Armenia and Uzbekistan, our revenues decreased in functional currency terms mainly due to the highly competitive environment in these countries. Consolidated cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by 18.3% to $3,536.1 million from $2,988.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our consolidated cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories as a percentage of our total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to 28.7% as compared to 26.5% in the year ended December 31, 2010, due to the expansion of our retail operations, which generally have lower margins than our communications service operations. The cost of value-added services as a percentage of our total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to 3.1% as compared to 2.5% in the year ended December 31, 2010, which corresponds to the increase in value-added services revenues. Interconnect expenses as a percentage of our total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to 12.3%, as compared to 11.5% in the year ended December 31, 2010, due to an increase in outgoing traffic volumes. Russia revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by 12.9% to $10,632.3 million from $9,414.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in Russia revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011, was primarily due to the growth of revenues from value-added services, fixed revenues, interconnect revenues, sales of handsets and accessories. The increase in Russia revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, is also partially attributable to the appreciation of the Russian ruble, our functional currency in Russia, against the U.S. dollar. Revenues from value-added services as a percentage of Russia revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011, grew to 17.2% as compared to 14.3% in the year ended December 31, 2010, due to the increase in data traffic volumes attributable to the introduction of new marketing initiatives aimed at stimulating greater usage of value-added services among our subscribers and the overall improvement of quality of these services. Interconnect revenues as a percentage of Russia revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011, grew to 10.4%, as compared to 9.5% in the year ended December 31, 2010, due to the growth in the volume of traffic from our competitors. Our continued expansion of our monobrand retail chain in 2011 caused sales of handsets and accessories to increase as a percentage of Russia revenues to 8.2% in the year ended December 31, 2011, from 7.5% in the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in fixed revenues was primarily due to the continued growth in domestic and international long distance and "calling party pays" traffic volumes, growth in the broadband Internet business and the regulatory price increase for residential and corporate voice services. 147 Table of Contents Russia cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by 23.4% to $3,173.8 million from $2,571.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The growth was primarily due to the increase in outgoing traffic volumes, cost of handsets and accessories and cost of value-added services. Interconnect expenses increased to $1,347.0 million or 12.7% of Russia revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011, from $1,083.4 million or 11.5% of Russia revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010, mainly due to the growth in outgoing network traffic. Cost of handsets and accessories sold and SIM-cards provided to customers as a percentage of Russia revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to 8.1% as compared to 7.3% in the year ended December 31, 2010, mainly due to to the continued expansion of our retail business in 2011. Active promotion of value-added services during the year ended December 31, 2011, resulted in an increase of value-added services cost as a percentage of Russia revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011, to 3.1% as compared to 2.5% in the year ended December 31, 2010. Ukraine revenues increased by 6.5% to $1,142.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, from $1,072.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to the growth in usage of value-added services by our subscribers and the increase in the number of our subscribers by 7.1% to 19.5 million from 18.2 million. Value-added services revenues increased by 23.6% to $303.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, from $245.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, due to the active promotion of these services among our subscribers. Value-added services revenues as a percentage of Ukraine revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011, grew to 26.5%, as compared to 22.9% in the year ended December 31, 2010. Ukraine cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories increased insignificantly by 2.3% to $320.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, from $313.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase occurred primarily due to an increase in regular payments for radio frequencies and growth of electricity tariffs regulated by the government by $11.5 million to $64.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, from $52.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, and to 5.6% from 4.9%, respectively, as a percentage of Ukraine revenues. This was partially offset by a decrease in interconnect expenses as a percentage of Ukraine revenues to 13.9% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 15.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010, due to the decrease in interconnect rates charged by Kyivstar. Ukraine cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories as a percentage of Ukraine revenues decreased to 28.1% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 29.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Other countries and business activities revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased by 25.6% to $643.0 million from $864.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decline was primarily caused by us ceasing to provide mobile telecommunications services in Turkmenistan at the end of 2010. In functional currency terms, we experienced a decrease in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, by approximately 1.6% in Uzbekistan and 3.4% in Armenia. While the subscriber base in Uzbekistan grew by 5.8% to 9.3 million as of December 31, 2011, from 8.8 million as of December 31, 2010, and traffic volume increased overall, these increases were offset by a decrease in tariffs as a response to our competitors' actions and the subscribers' migration to low cost tariff plans. The subscriber base in Armenia decreased by 3.4% to 2.4 million as of December 31, 2011, from 2.5 million as of December 31, 2010. Other countries and business activities cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased to $132.7 million from $156.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decline was primarily caused by us ceasing to provide mobile telecommunications services in Turkmenistan at the end of 2010. 148 Table of Contents Sundry operating expenses Consolidated sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by 1.5% to $2,760.3 million from $2,719.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase of $41.3 million in sundry operating expenses was partly attributable to a general increase in expenses caused by the growth in our operations, as well as the appreciation of the functional currencies, in countries in which we operate, against the U.S. dollar. Sundry operating expenses as a percentage of our total revenues decreased to 22.4% in the year ended December 31, 2011, from 24.1% in the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in salary expenses and related social contributions as a percentage of our revenues to 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2011 from 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010, due to our cost reduction programs and improvements in operational efficiencies. Moreover, sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, were adversely affected by the impairment of our assets in Turkmenistan which contributed an additional 1.2% to sundry operating expense margin. Russia sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by 6.6% to $2,182.5 million from $2,047.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Russia sundry operating expenses as a percentage of Russia revenues decreased to 20.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 21.7% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease of Russia sundry operating expenses as a percentage of Russia revenues was mainly attributable to a decrease in the percentage of salary expenses and related social contributions to 9.0% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 10.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010, due to our cost reduction programs and improvements in operational efficiencies. Ukraine sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by 10.5% to $197.3 million from $178.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Ukraine sundry operating expenses as a percentage of Ukraine revenues increased to 17.3% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 16.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is primarily attributable to the VAT-related changes in Ukrainian tax legislation. Other countries and business activities sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased by 23.1% to $380.7 million from $495.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease was primarily attributable to the termination of our operations in Turkmenistan and subsequent decline in sundry operating expenses by $190.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, including the impairment of assets in the amount of $137.8 million. The decrease was partially offset by the growth in sundry operating expenses of our corporate headquarters by $75.8 million due to the merger with Comstar, as sundry operating expenses of the former Comstar Headquarters are now included in other countries and business activities results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. Other countries and business activities sundry operating expenses as a percentage of other countries and business activities revenues increased to 59.2% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 57.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase is mainly attributable to the merger with Comstar. Sales and marketing expenses Consolidated sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by 3.2%, or $27.6 million, to $878.2 million from $850.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This growth was mainly attributable to the increase in commissions payable to dealers while dealers' commissions as a percentage of our revenues remained stable at 4.7% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. This resulted from the fact that dealers acquired subscribers with a higher ARPU, while our subscriber base remained stable. Advertising and promotion expenses decreased by 4.5%, or $14.6 million, to $305.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, from $319.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, which was primarily attributable to our cost 149 Table of Contents optimization efforts. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of our total revenues decreased to 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 7.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Russia sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $749.5 million, or 7.0% of Russia revenue, from $704.1 million, or 7.5% of Russia revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in sales and marketing expenses by 6.4% was due to the appreciation of the ruble and the increase of dealers commissions. Dealer commissions as a percentage of Russia revenues decreased to 4.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Advertising and marketing expenses as a percentage of Russia revenues decreased to 2.3% for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Ukraine sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased to $76.1 million, or 6.7% of Ukraine revenues, from $81.9 million, or 7.6% of Ukraine revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses by $5.8 million and as a percentage of Ukraine revenues was primarily attributable to the reduction of advertising and promotion expenses as a result of our cost optimization efforts. Other countries and business activities sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased by 14.6% to $59.8 million from $70.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease was mainly attributable to the reduction of advertising and promotion expenses as a result of our cost optimization efforts. As a percentage of other countries and business activities total revenues, other countries and business activities sales and marketing expenses increased to 9.3% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was mainly attributable to the termination of our operations in Turkmenistan. Depreciation and amortization expenses Consolidated depreciation and amortization of property, network equipment, telephone numbering capacity, license costs and other intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by 16.7% to $2,335.2 million from $2,000.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was due to our increased asset base resulting from the continued expansion of our network through build-outs, as well as due to the decrease of the estimated useful life of certain equipment which we intend to replace. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of our total revenues increased to 19.0% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 17.7% for the year ended December 31, 2010, due to reasons described below. Russia depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by 23.5% to $1,752.0 million from $1,418.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, mainly as a result of the build-out of our 3G networks and acquisition of fixed line operators. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to 16.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 15.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Ukraine depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $344.7 million, or 30.2% of Ukraine revenues, and $354.2 million, or 33.0% of Ukraine revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2010. Depreciation and amortization expense as percentage of Ukraine revenues decreased due to the growth of our revenues from value-added services. 150 Table of Contents Other countries and business activities depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by 4.8% to $238.5 million from $227.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and increased as a percentage of other countries and business activities total revenues to 37.1% from 26.3%, respectively. Growth in other countries and business activities depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of other countries and business activities total revenues was primarily attributable to the termination of our operations in Turkmenistan and the overall growth of the depreciation expenses in Uzbekistan, where we continued the expansion of our network. Operating Income Consolidated operating income increased by 2.7% to $2,808.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, from $2,734.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Operating income as a percentage of our total revenues decreased to 22.8% for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 24.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase of operating income in absolute terms by $74.3 million was mainly driven by the growth of our consolidated revenues due to the factors described above. Moreover, the impairment of our assets in Turkmenistan adversely affected our operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in operating income margin for the year ended December 31, 2011, was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization, cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories as a percentage of our total revenues. Russia operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by 3.8% to $2,774.4 million from $2,673.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Russia operating income decreased as a percentage of Russia revenues to 26.1% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 28.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010, mainly due to the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of Russia revenues to 16.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 15.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease was also accelerated by the expansion of our retail network with its historically lower margins on sales of handsets and accessories, and a slight increase in cost of services as a percentage of our Russia revenues to 21.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 20.0% for the year ended December 31, 2010, due to the reasons described above. The increase of cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories was offset by a decrease in sales and marketing and sundry operating expenses as a percentage of Russia revenues to 27.6% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 29.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010, due to cost reduction programs and improvements in operational efficiencies. Ukraine operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by 40.9% to $203.6 million from $144.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Ukraine operating income increased as a percentage of Ukraine revenues to 17.8% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 13.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010. These increases were largely due to the growth in Ukraine revenues and the simultaneous decline of interconnect expense as a percentage of Ukraine revenues due to a decrease in interconnect rates charged by Kyivstar. We also experienced a decrease of sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of Ukraine revenues to 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 7.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010, which resulted from our cost optimization efforts. Depreciation and amortization expenses also declined as a percentage of our Ukraine revenues to 30.2% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 33.0% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Other countries and business activities operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2011, amounted to $168.6 million, while other countries and business activities' operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $84.8 million. The increase in loss resulted from growth in sundry operating expenses of our corporate headquarters due to the reasons described above and the increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of other countries and business activities 151 Table of Contents revenues to 37.1% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 26.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010. This was primarily attributable to the termination of our operations in Turkmenistan and the increase in depreciation expenses in Uzbekistan where we continued to expand our network while our revenues decreased due to the factors described above. Currency exchange and transaction gains/losses Consolidated currency exchange and transaction losses for the year ended December 31, 2011, were $158.1 million, compared to gains of $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. We conduct our operations within the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Armenia, and we are therefore subject to currency fluctuations. The local currencies of these countries fluctuated significantly against the U.S. dollar and euro during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the currency exchange and transaction losses we incurred were primarily due to the translation effect of our U.S. dollar and euro-denominated debt as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. The losses recognized in 2011 as compared to gains recorded in 2010 were mainly due to the depreciation of the Russian ruble and the Uzbek sum against the U.S. dollar and euro during the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 2010. Interest expense Consolidated interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased by $120.4 million, or 15.5%, to $656.9 million from $777.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in the amount of $60.7 million is due to the decline in amortization of our debt issuance costs. In 2010, the amortization of debt issuance costs was affected by the voluntary repayment of approximately $1.4 billion of our debt balance outstanding as of December 31, 2010, before the due date, which resulted in an immediate write-off of the related debt issuance cost in a total amount of $24.3 million. Additionally, in 2010, we renegotiated the interest rates and maturities of several credit facilities, which led to a significant modification of the related debt agreements and the consequent write-off of capitalized issuance costs totaling $26.4 million. None of the amendments to our credit facilities agreements in 2011 were considered to be substantial, so that no additional expense occurred. The hedging activities in 2011 resulted in an interest expense decrease in the amount of $19.2 million as compared to 2010. The extension of our construction activities in 2011 allowed us to capitalize $8.4 million more interest expense than in 2010. The remaining decrease was due to the decrease in our weighted average interest rate in 2011. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for more information. Equity in net income of associates Consolidated equity in net income of associates for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased by $21.2 million, or 30.0%, to a gain of $49.4 million, compared to a gain of $70.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decline is attributable to the significant depreciation of the Belarusian ruble against the U.S. dollar and subsequent decline in revenues of our equity investee in Belarus during the year ended December 31, 2011. Other expenses (income), net Consolidated other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased to $6.6 million, as compared to $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease was primarily attributable to accrued damages plus interest relating to the dispute with Nomihold in the year ended December 31, 2010, as described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. 152 Table of Contents Provision for income taxes Consolidated provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by 2.8% to $531.6 million from $517.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The effective tax rate increased slightly to 25.3% in the year ended December 31, 2011, from 25.0% in the year ended December 31, 2010. Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2011, amounted to $123.8 million compared to net income attributable to the non-controlling interest of $167.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decline in net income attributable to the non-controlling interest resulted from the increase of our ownership interest in MGTS during the year ended December 31, 2011, from 51.3% to 94.1%. Net income attributable to the Group Net income attributable to the Group for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $63.3 million, or 4.6%, to $1,443.9 million, compared to $1,380.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Net income as a percentage of revenues was 11.7% in the year ended December 31, 2011, and 12.2% in the year ended December 31, 2010. Net income attributable to the Group for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, increased mainly due to the effect of the loss from the impairment of our assets in Turkmenistan recognized in the year ended December 31, 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2010 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenues and cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by $1,426.0 million, or 14.5%, to $11,293.2 million from $9,867.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. In functional currency terms, our consolidated revenues increased in all countries in which we operate, other than in Armenia, in 2010 compared to 2009 mainly due to increased usage of value-added services, increased traffic on our mobile networks and as a result of the expansion of our retail business in Russia. Our consolidated mobile subscriber base grew by 5.7% to approximately 103.35 million as of December 31, 2010, from approximately 97.8 million as of December 31, 2009. The growth in our subscriber base was mainly attributable to our sales and marketing efforts and the expansion of our network. In Armenia, our consolidated revenues decreased in functional currency terms mainly due to the highly competitive environment in Armenia. Consolidated cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 25.2% to $2,988.6 million from $2,386.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. In functional currency terms, our consolidated cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories increased in all countries in which we operate, other than in Armenia, largely due to the same factors described above that caused our consolidated revenues to increase in functional currency terms. Our consolidated cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories as a percentage of our total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to 26.5% as compared to 24.2% in the year ended December 31, 2009, mainly due to the expansion of our retail operations, which generally have lower margins than our communications service operations. Russia revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 16.6% to $9,414.9 million from $8,074.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in Russia revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily due to the growth of roaming revenues, revenues from value-added services, sales of handsets and accessories, and fixed revenues. Roaming revenues increased 153 Table of Contents by 20.0% in the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to the growth of roaming activity as a result of an economic recovery and increase in number of subscribers by 3.1% to 71.4 million as of December 31, 2010, from 69.3 million as of December 31, 2009. Revenues from value-added services as a percentage of Russia revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010, grew to 17.3% as compared to 16.3% in the year ended December 31, 2009, due to the introduction of new marketing initiatives aimed at stimulating greater usage of value-added services among our subscribers. Our continued expansion of our monobrand retail chain in 2010 caused sales of handsets and accessories to increase as a percentage of Russia revenues to 7.5% in the year ended December 31, 2010, from 4.3% in the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in fixed revenues was primarily caused by continued growth in domestic and international long distance and "calling party pays" traffic volumes, growth in the broadband Internet business and a regulatory price increase for residential and corporate voice services. Russia cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 34.5% to $2,571.5 million from $1,935.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The growth was primarily due to the increase in the number of subscribers, traffic volume, cost of handsets and accessories, and a rise in utility and energy costs due to the increase in state regulated tariffs. Interconnect expenses increased to $1,083.4 million or 11.5% of Russia revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010, from $874.0 million or 10.8% of Russia revenues in the year ended December 31, 2009, mainly due to the growth in outgoing network traffic. Cost of handsets, accessories sold and SIM-cards provided to customers as a percentage of Russia revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to 7.3% as compared to 4.1% in the year ended December 31, 2009, mainly due to the continued expansion of our retail business in 2010. Ukraine revenues increased by 2.3% to $1,072.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, from $1,048.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to growth in the number of our subscribers by 3.6% to 18.2 million from 17.6 million. Ukraine cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories decreased by 5.7% to $313.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, from $332.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. The decline occurred primarily due to a decrease in interconnect expenses by $30.2 million to $163.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, from $193.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2009, and to 15.2% from 18.4%, respectively, as a percentage of Ukraine revenues. The decrease in interconnect expenses resulted from a reduction of interconnect rates with Kyivstar, which was partially offset by an increase in the cost of providing value-added services to 3.5% from 2.8% of total Ukraine revenues. Other countries and business activities revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 9.8% to $864.4 million from $787.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. In functional currency terms, the increase in revenues in 2010 as compared to 2009 was approximately 19.8% in Uzbekistan and 29.1% in Turkmenistan. In Armenia, in functional currency terms we experienced a decrease in revenues of 3.7%. Our subscriber base in Turkmenistan increased by 37.6% during the year ended December 31, 2010, which led to increased traffic volume. Our subscriber base grew by 23.7% in Uzbekistan during the year ended December 31, 2010, and our revenues generally increased in line with this growth. Our subscriber base in Armenia grew by 18.7% during 2010 as compared to 2009 which was diluted by a decrease in tariffs as a response to our competitors' actions in Armenia. Other countries and business activities cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories for the year ended December 31, 2010, remained stable as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, and equaled $156.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and $156.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. As a percentage of other countries and business activities total revenues, these costs decreased to 18.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 19.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to effective cost control. 154 Table of Contents Sundry operating expenses Consolidated sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 15.6% to $2,719.0 million from $2,351.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $367.1 million in sundry operating expenses was attributable in part to the acquisition of Multiregion, the impairment of our business in Turkmenistan, as well as the appreciation of the functional currencies in countries in which we operate against the U.S. dollar. Sundry operating expenses as a percentage of our total revenues increased to 24.2% in the year ended December 31, 2010, from 23.8% in the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase was mainly attributable to growth in salary expenses and related social contributions as well as rent expense due to the expansion of our retail network and a corresponding increase in employees. Salary expenses and related social contributions as a percentage of our total revenues grew to 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 10.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Similarly, our rent expenses increased due to our retail network expansion. Rent expenses as a percentage of our total revenues grew to 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 2.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was also attributable to the increase in loss from impairment as a percentage of our total revenues to 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 0.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009, due to the impairment of long-lived assets in Turkmenistan. Russia sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 7.9% to $2,047.0 million from $1,897.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Russia sundry operating expenses as a percentage of Russia revenues decreased to 21.7% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 23.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in Russia sundry operating expenses was mainly attributable to the acquisition of Multiregion, as well as the increase in consulting expenses paid in connection with the sale of our stake in Svyazinvest. The decrease of Russia sundry operating expenses as a percentage of Russia revenues was primarily caused by the release of tax reserves, except for the income tax reserves, relating to our retail business, by the reduction in the number of top managers in connection with the merger of MTS and Comstar, by the cost-reduction programs and by the improvements in operational efficiencies in the regions through the integration of our regional pay-TV operations. Ukraine sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 18.2% to $178.5 million from $151.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Ukraine sundry operating expenses as a percentage of Ukraine revenues increased to 16.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 14.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009. These expenses increased primarily due to increases in salary expenses and related social contributions, repair and maintenance expenses and billing and data processing expenses. Other countries and business activities sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 63.1% to $495.0 million from $304.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Other countries and business activities sundry operating expenses as a percentage of other countries and business activities total revenues increased to 57.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 38.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to the impairment of long-lived assets in Turkmenistan. Sales and marketing expenses Consolidated sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 16.8%, or $122.1 million, to $850.6 million from $728.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase was mainly due to the increase in commissions payable to dealers as a result of an overall increase in the commission rates. Advertising and promotion expenses decreased, which was primarily attributable to our cost optimization efforts. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of our total revenues remained stable at 7.5% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. 155 Table of Contents Russia sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $704.1 million, or 7.5% of Russia revenue, from $582.7 million, or 7.2% of Russia revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in sales and marketing expenses by 20.8% was due to appreciation of the ruble and an increase of dealer commission rates. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of advertising and marketing expenses. Dealer commissions as a percentage of Russia revenues increased to 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Advertising and marketing expenses as a percentage of Russia revenues decreased to 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009.

The decrease in sales and marketing expenses by $10.7 million and as a percentage of Ukraine revenues was primarily due to the reduction of dealer commissions as a result of a decrease in revenue sharing rates. Other countries and business activities sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 19.7% to $70.0 million from $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. As a percentage of other countries and business activities total revenues, other countries and business activities sales and marketing expenses increased to 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was mainly attributable to growth in expenses related to the MTS Bonus loyalty program. Depreciation and amortization expenses Consolidated depreciation and amortization of property, network equipment, telephone numbering capacity, license costs and other intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 8.5% to $2,000.5 million from $1,844.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was due to our increased asset base resulting from the continued expansion of our network through build-outs, as well as due to accelerated depreciation of certain equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of our total revenues decreased to 17.7% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 18.7% for the year ended December 31, 2009, due to reasons described below. Russia depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 8.7% to $1,418.7 million from $1,305.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 mainly as a result of the build-out of our 3G networks. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of Russia revenues decreased to 15.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was mainly due to the fact that a substantial portion of Russia capital expenditure took place in December 2010, such that the recognition of depreciation and amortization expense for the newly acquired assets started only at the end of 2010. Ukraine depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $354.2 million, or 33.0% of Ukraine revenues, and $352.0 million, or 33.6% of Ukraine revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense as percentage of Ukraine revenues decreased as our 2009 revenues were affected by the global economic crisis. Other countries and business activities depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 22.0% to $227.6 million from $186.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, and increased as a percentage of other countries and business activities total revenues to 26.3% from 23.8%. Growth in other countries and business activities depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of other countries and business activities total revenues was primarily attributable to our operations in Uzbekistan, where we continued expansion of our network. 156 Table of Contents Operating Income Consolidated operating income increased by 7.0% to $2,734.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $2,555.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Operating income as a percentage of our total revenues decreased to 24.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to 25.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease of operating income by $178.7 million was mainly due to the impairment of our assets in Turkmenistan combined with the other factors described above. The decrease in the operating income margin was due to an increase in salaries and social contributions, rent expenses, dealer commissions, provision for obsolescence and impairment of long-lived assets as a percentage of our total revenues. Russia operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 13.6% to $2,673.6 million from $2,353.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Russia operating income decreased as a percentage of Russia revenues to 28.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 29.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009, mainly due to the expansion of our retail network, which resulted in an increase in salaries and social contributions, rent, provision for obsolescence, accelerated by historically lower margins on sales of handsets and accessories. This decrease was offset by a decrease in impairment of long-lived assets, the release of a VAT provision relating to our retail business and depreciation and amortization expenses. The decrease in Russia operating income margin was also attributable to higher sales and marketing costs. In addition, our operating income was affected by the appreciation of the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar. Ukraine operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 20.1% to $144.5 million from $120.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Ukraine operating income increased as a percentage of Ukraine revenues to 13.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 11.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009. These increases were largely due to the decrease in sales and marketing expenses, as well as interconnect expenses due to a decrease in interconnect rates with Kyivstar. Other countries and business activities operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 amounted to $84.8 million. The loss resulted from impairment of our assets in Turkmenistan. The effect of the impairment on the operating results of other countries and business activities amounted to $137.8 million. Currency exchange and transaction gains/losses Consolidated currency exchange and transaction gains for the year ended December 31, 2010, were $20.2 million, compared to losses of $252.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. We conduct our operations within the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Armenia, and we are therefore subject to currency fluctuations. The local currencies of these countries fluctuated significantly against the U.S. dollar and euro during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the currency exchange and transaction gains we incurred were primarily due to the translation effect of our U.S. dollar and euro-denominated debt as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The gains recognized in 2010 as compared to losses recorded in 2009 were mainly due to the appreciation of the Russian ruble and the Armenian dram against the U.S. dollar and euro during the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 2009. Interest expense Consolidated interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by $205.4 million, or 35.9% to $777.3 million from $571.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. In 2010, we voluntarily repaid approximately $1.4 billion of our debt balance outstanding as of December 31, 2009 before the due date, and this resulted in an immediate write-off of the related debt issuance cost in a total amount of $24.3 million. During 2010, we renegotiated the interest rates and maturities of several 157 Table of Contents credit facilities, which led to a significant modification of the related debt agreements and the consequent write-off of capitalized issuance costs totaling $26.4 million. The remaining increase is due to the increase in our average balance of indebtedness in 2010. Impairment of investments There was no consolidated impairment of investments loss in the year ended December 31, 2010. The consolidated impairment of investments loss for the year ended December 31, 2009, included write offs of investments in Svyazinvest. Equity in net income of associates Consolidated equity in net income of associates for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by $10.3 million, or 17.1% to a gain of $70.6 million, compared to a gain of $60.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Consolidated equity in net income of associates for the year ended December 31, 2009, was affected by a write-off of our investment in Coral/Sistema Strategic Fund. Other expenses (income), net Consolidated other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $66.9 million, as compared to $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to accrued damages plus interest relating to the dispute with Nomihold. Provision for income taxes Consolidated provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 2.4% to $517.2 million from $505.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The effective tax rate decreased to 25.0% in the year ended December 31, 2010, from 33.7% in the year ended December 31, 2009. The high effective tax rate in 2009 was caused by the changes in the valuation allowance against tax loss carry-forwards of MGTS Finance S.A. and valuation of investment in Svyazinvest, recognition of deferred tax liability related to potential earnings distributions from/to our subsidiaries, the effect of the disposal of treasury stock by Comstar, and other nondeductible items which took place in 2009. Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2010, amounted to $167.8 million compared to $20.1 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2009. Net loss attributable to the non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2009, was the result of a decrease in the net income of Comstar due to the impairment of its investment in Svyazinvest, as well as the foreign exchange and transactions losses incurred on the note payable to Access. Net income attributable to the Group Net income attributable to the Group for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by $366.4 million, or 36.1%, to $1,380.6 million, compared to $1,014.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Net income as a percentage of revenues was 12.2% in the year ended December 31, 2010, and 10.3% in the year ended December 31, 2009. Net income attributable to the Group for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, increased mainly due to currency exchange rates and transaction gains resulting from appreciation of the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar and euro, and a decrease in write-offs of investments. 158 Table of Contents B. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our borrowings consist of notes and bank loans. Since 2001, we have raised a total of $2.5 billion through seven U.S. dollar-denominated unsecured bond offerings in the international capital markets, as well as ruble-denominated bonds totaling RUB 86 billion (equivalent in aggregate to $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2011). Our bank loans consist of U.S. dollar-, euro- and ruble-denominated borrowings totaling approximately $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2011. We repaid approximately $358.0 million of indebtedness in 2011. As of December 31, 2011, the total amount available to us under our credit facilities amounted to $1,321.3 million. We had total indebtedness of approximately $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2011, including capital lease obligations, compared to approximately $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2010. Our total interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011, was $777.3 million and $656.9 million, net of amounts capitalized, respectively. See Note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a description of our indebtedness. Capital Requirements We need capital to finance the following: capital expenditures, consisting of purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; acquisitions; repayment of debt and related interest payments; changes in working capital; and general corporate activities, including dividends. We anticipate that capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of long-term debt and dividends will represent the most significant uses of funds for several years to come. Our cash outlays for capital expenditures in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were $2,328.3 million, $2,647.1 million and $2,584.5 million, respectively. We expect to continue to finance most of our capital expenditure needs through our operating cash flows, and to the extent required, to incur additional indebtedness through borrowings or additional capital raising activities. Historically, a significant portion of our capital expenditures have been related to the installation and build-out of our network and expansion into new license areas. We expect that capital expenditures will remain a large portion of our cash outflows in connection with the continued installation and build-out of our network. We expect our total capital expenditures in 2012 to be approximately 20-22% of our total 2012 revenue. These investments are required to support the growth in our subscriber base (i.e., to improve network capacity), to maintain and modernize our mobile and fixed line networks, to develop our network in the regions and to continue the build-out of our 3G and backbone networks as well as the development of our proprietary retail chain in Russia. We expect that the development of our 3G network and modernization of our fixed line networks will be among our most significant capital expenditures and require considerable management resources.
