ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSNISOURCE INC.Following the Proposed Separation, both NiSource and CPG expect to initially receive an investment grade credit rating from Standard & Poor’s Rating Service, Moody’s Investor Service and Fitch Ratings Inc. (Ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.) We may not initially receive such ratings or, if received, our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant. There is no assurance that we will continue to maintain such investment grade credit ratings in the future. If a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease. In addition, a failure by us to maintain an investment grade rating could affect our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners. See "A drop in NiSource's credit rating could adversely impact NiSource's liquidity" above.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.16Table of Contents
