Item 1A. Risk Factors. You should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this Report in evaluating our business and our prospects. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Global Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results. Beginning in late 2008 and continuing through 2009, there was a substantial deterioration in the global economic environment. As part of this deterioration, there was substantial uncertainty in the capital markets and access to financing was reduced. Due to these conditions, our customers reduced or curtailed their drilling programs, which resulted in a decrease in demand for our services. Furthermore, these factors resulted in certain of our customers experiencing an inability to pay suppliers, including us. Although the significant deterioration in the global economic environment appeared to stabilize to some degree during 2010 and 2011, there is no assurance that the global economic environment will not quickly deteriorate again due to one or more factors. A return of the conditions causing a deterioration in the global economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 11 Table of Contents We Are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas. Declines in Customers Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results. We depend on our customers willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in North America. If these expenditures decline, our business may suffer. Our customers willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as:  the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, including current natural gas storage capacity and usage,  the prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas,  the supply of and demand for drilling and pressure pumping equipment,  the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas,  public pressure on, and legislative and regulatory interest within, federal, state and local governments to stop, significantly limit or regulate drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities, and  merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers. In particular, our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices. For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile. Prices are affected by factors such as:  market supply and demand,  international military, political and economic conditions,  the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly known as OPEC, to set and maintain production and price targets,  technical advances affecting energy consumption, and  the price and availability of alternative fuels. All of these factors are beyond our control. During the second quarter of 2008, the quarterly average market price of natural gas (Henry Hub spot price as reported by the Energy Information Administration) was $11.74 per Mcf and the quarterly average market price of oil (WTI spot price as reported by the Energy Information Administration) was $123.95 per barrel. In the last half of 2008, commodity prices rapidly declined and averaged $6.60 per Mcf for natural gas and $58.35 per barrel for oil in the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, the price of natural gas declined further and averaged $4.06 per Mcf for the year. Oil prices remained depressed during 2009 as well and averaged $61.65 per barrel for the year. These declines in the market price of natural gas and oil resulted in our customers significantly reducing their drilling activities beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, and drilling activities remained low throughout 2009. Drilling activities increased in 2010 as did the prices for oil and natural gas. The increased drilling activity was largely attributed to increased development of unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs and an improvement in the price of oil which averaged $79.40 per barrel in 2010. Drilling for oil and liquids rich targets continued to increase in 2011 as oil averaged $94.86 per barrel for the year. Natural gas prices decreased in 2011 to an average of $4.00 per Mcf. The 2011 decrease in natural gas prices was most significant in the fourth quarter where the average price dropped to $3.32 per Mcf and this decrease has continued into 2012 where natural gas prices fell below $3.00 per Mcf in January. The increase in drilling activity in oil rich basins has absorbed the decrease in demand for natural gas drilling activities in 2011 and our rig count increased in both 2010 and 2011. Our average number of rigs operating remains well below the number of our available rigs. Construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States during the last ten years has significantly contributed to excess capacity. As a result of decreased drilling activity and excess capacity, our average number of rigs operating has declined from historic highs. We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital. Low market prices for oil and natural gas would likely result in lower demand for our drilling rigs and pressure 12 Table of Contents pumping services and could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services. A General Excess of Operable Land Drilling Rigs, Increasing Rig Specialization and Excess Pressure Pumping Equipment May Adversely Affect Our Utilization and Profit Margins. The North American oil and natural gas services industry has experienced downturns in demand during the last decade. During these periods, there have been substantially more drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment available than necessary to meet demand. As a result, drilling and pressure pumping contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins and, at times, have incurred losses during the downturn periods. In addition, unconventional resource plays have substantially increased and some drilling rigs are not capable of drilling these wells efficiently. Accordingly, the utilization of some older technology drilling rigs may be hampered by their lack of capability to successfully compete for this work. Other ongoing factors which could continue to adversely affect utilization rates and pricing, even in an environment of high oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity, include:  movement of drilling rigs from region to region,  reactivation of land-based drilling rigs, or  construction of new technology drilling rigs. Construction of new technology drilling rigs has increased in recent years. The addition of new technology drilling rigs to the market, combined with a reduction in the drilling of vertical wells, has resulted in excess capacity of conventional drilling rigs. Similarly, the substantial recent increase in unconventional resource plays has led to higher demand for pressure pumping services and we believe there has been, and we expect there to continue to be, a significant increase in the construction of new pressure pumping equipment. The addition of new pressure pumping equipment, as well as any general decline in demand for pressure pumping services, could result in there being substantially more pressure pumping equipment available than necessary to meet demand. If this were to occur, providers of pressure pumping services will have difficulty sustaining profit margins and may sustain losses during downturn periods. We cannot predict the future level of demand for our contract drilling or pressure pumping services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas contract drilling or pressure pumping businesses. Shortages of Drill Pipe, Replacement Parts, Other Equipment, Supplies and Materials Adversely Affect Our Operating Results. During periods of increased demand for drilling and pressure pumping services, the industry has experienced shortages of drill pipe, replacement parts, other equipment, supplies and materials, including, in the case of our pressure pumping operations, proppants, acid, gel and water. These shortages can cause the price of these items to increase significantly and require that orders for the items be placed well in advance of expected use. In addition, any interruption in supply could result in significant delays in delivery of equipment and materials or prevent operations. Interruptions may be caused by, among other reasons:  weather issues, whether short-term such as a hurricane, or long-term such as a drought, and  a shortage in the number of vendors able or willing to provide the necessary equipment, supplies and materials, including as a result of commitments of vendors to other customers or third parties. These price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and incur higher operating costs. Severe shortages, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply could limit our ability to construct and operate our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 13 Table of Contents Fixed Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment. Fixed term drilling contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an early termination payment to be paid to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term. However, in certain limited circumstances, for example, destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time, our bankruptcy, or a sustained breach of our contract obligations, no early termination payment may be paid to us. Additionally, during depressed market conditions or otherwise, customers may seek to terminate, renegotiate or fail to honor their contractual obligations. The failure to receive an early termination payment under a number of our fixed-term contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The Oil Service Business Segments in Which We Operate Are Highly Competitive with Excess Capacity, which Adversely Affects Our Operating Results. Our land drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive. At times, available land drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment exceed the demand for such equipment. This excess capacity has resulted in substantial competition for drilling and pressure pumping contracts. The fact that drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment are mobile and can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry. We believe that price competition for drilling and pressure pumping contracts will continue due to the existence of available rigs and pressure pumping equipment. In recent years, many drilling and pressure pumping companies have consolidated or merged with other companies. Although this consolidation has decreased the total number of competitors, we believe the competition for drilling and pressure pumping services will continue to be intense. As a result of competition, our utilization may decrease and/or we may be unable to maintain or increase prices for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Labor Shortages and Rising Labor Costs Adversely Affect Our Operating Results. During periods of increasing demand for contract drilling and pressure pumping services, the industry experiences shortages of qualified personnel. During these periods, our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to market and operate our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment is adversely affected, which negatively impacts both our operations and profitability. Operationally, it is more difficult to hire qualified personnel, which adversely affects our ability to mobilize inactive rigs and pressure pumping equipment in response to the increased demand for such services. Additionally, wage rates for drilling and pressure pumping personnel are likely to increase during periods of increasing demand, resulting in higher operating costs. The Loss of Large Customers Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In 2011, we received approximately 41 percent of our consolidated operating revenues from our ten largest customers (including their affiliates). Although no single customer accounted for more than seven percent of our consolidated operating revenue in 2011, the loss of one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Growth Through the Building of New Rigs and Pressure Pumping Equipment and Rig and Other Acquisitions Are Not Assured. We have increased our drilling rig fleet and pressure pumping horsepower in the past through mergers, acquisitions and new construction. The land drilling and pressure pumping industries have experienced significant consolidation, and there can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available in the future. We are also likely to continue to face intense competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities. In addition, because improved technology has enhanced the ability to recover oil and natural gas, contract drillers may continue to build new, high technology rigs and providers of pressure pumping services may continue to build new, high horsepower equipment. 14 Table of Contents There can be no assurance that we will:  have sufficient capital resources to complete additional acquisitions or build new rigs or pressure pumping equipment,  successfully integrate additional drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets,  effectively manage the growth and increased size of our organization, drilling fleet and pressure pumping equipment,  successfully deploy idle, stacked or additional rigs and pressure pumping equipment,  maintain the crews necessary to operate additional drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, or  successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of any completed acquisition or the building of new drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment. We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions, build new drilling rigs or build new pressure pumping equipment and also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such acquisitions or building program. Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity could be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, continued growth could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources. Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims. We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us. Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution and reservoir damage. These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property. Our operations could also cause significant environmental and reservoir damages. These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages. We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance. In general, our drilling and pressure pumping contracts typically contain contractual rights to indemnity from our customers for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage. Our contractual right to indemnification, however, may be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers. Our customers may dispute, or be unable to meet their contractual indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons. Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers by contract or indemnification agreements. We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our rigs and other assets, employers liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability insurance, workers compensation and insurance for other specific risks. We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us. While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, our drilling rigs and other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of the rigs or other assets. We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies. For example, we generally maintain a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our workers compensation and equipment insurance coverage and a $2.0 million per occurrence self insured retention on our general liability insurance coverage. We self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption, and do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage. 15 Table of Contents Our insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations. Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions. As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage. There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive or that our coverage will cover a specific loss. Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage. Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a customer, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. We Are Dependent Upon our Subsidiaries to Meet our Obligations Under our Long Term Debt We have borrowings outstanding under a term loan and revolving credit facility as well as our senior notes. These obligations are guaranteed by each of our existing subsidiaries other than immaterial subsidiaries. Our ability to meet our interest and principal payment obligations depends in large part on dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries. If our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flows to pay us dividends, we may be unable to meet our interest and principal payment obligations. Variable Rate Indebtedness Subjects Us to Interest Rate Risk, Which Could Cause Our Debt Service Obligations to Increase Significantly. We have in place a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility and a term loan facility. Interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the credit facility at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate. The margin on LIBOR loans ranges from 2.75% to 3.75% and the margin on base rate loans ranges from 1.75% to 2.75%, based on our debt to capitalization ratio. At December 31, 2011, the margin on LIBOR loans was 2.75% and the margin on base rate loans was 1.75%. As of December 31, 2011, we had $110 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 4.05% and $92.5 million outstanding under our term credit facility at an interest rate of 3.25%. A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under our revolving and term credit facilities as of December 31, 2011 would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately $2.0 million. Interest rates could rise for various reasons in the future and increase our total interest expense, depending upon the amounts borrowed. New Technologies May Cause Our Drilling and Pressure Pumping Processes and Equipment to Become Less Competitive, Resulting in an Adverse Effect on our Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Changes in technology or improvements in competitors processes and equipment could make our processes and equipment less competitive or require significant capital expenditures to keep our processes and equipment competitive. Any such changes in technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Environmental Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results. All of our operations and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, foreign and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials, the use of underground storage tanks, and the use of underground injection wells. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be substantial. A failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to substantial civil and criminal penalties. In addition, environmental laws and regulations in the United States and Canada impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages from such spills. As an owner and operator of land-based drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under these laws and regulations. 16 Table of Contents Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and such laws and regulations tend to become more stringent over time. Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs for us and our customers and have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position. For example, in July 2011, the EPA issued proposed rules under the NSPS and NESHAP programs that would, among other things, impose new standards for flowback operations during completions at new, hydraulically fractured or re-fractured natural gas wells. These proposed rules may require the implementation of new operating standards which may impact our business. If these or other initiatives result in an increase in regulation, it could increase costs to us and our customers or reduce demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing Could Increase Our Costs and Result in Operational Delays. Members of the U.S. Congress and the EPA are reviewing more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a technology employed by our pressure pumping business, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production. Both the EPA and the U.S. Congress are studying whether there is any link between hydraulic fracturing activities and soil or ground water contamination. As part of their respective studies, the House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment and the EPA each sent requests to a number of companies, including our company, for information on their hydraulic fracturing practices. We have responded to each of the inquiries. In addition, legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress to amend the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process are impairing ground water or causing other damage. These bills, if adopted, could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal or state level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. Certain states where we operate, including Texas, have adopted or are considering similar disclosure legislation. For example, Colorado, North Dakota, Montana, Texas, Louisiana, and Wyoming have adopted a variety of well construction, set back and disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be performed and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure. In addition, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the Safe Drinking Water Acts Underground Injection Control Program and has begun the process of drafting guidance documents related to this newly asserted regulatory authority. Additional regulation could increase the costs of conducting our business and could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation. There are also certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices, including the White House Council on Environmental Quality and a committee of the United States House of Representatives. Furthermore, a number of federal agencies, including the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy, are analyzing, or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. Also, the U.S. Department of the Interior is considering disclosure requirements or other mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their course, and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanism. Legislation and Regulation of Greenhouse Gases Could Adversely Affect our Business We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. We are also aware of legislation proposed by United States lawmakers and the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions, as well as GHG emissions regulations enacted by the EPA and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHG present a danger to public health and the environment 17 Table of Contents because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earths atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on its findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act, including one regulation that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large sources. In addition, the EPA published rules requiring reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States on an annual basis, which has been amended to include certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities. In addition, almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws or regulations related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas. Anti-takeover Measures in Our Charter Documents and Under State Law Could Discourage an Acquisition and Thereby Affect the Related Purchase Price. We are a Delaware corporation subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law, including Section 203, an anti-takeover law. Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of that stock without further vote or action by the holders of the common stock. It also prohibits stockholders from acting by written consent without the holding of a meeting. In addition, our bylaws impose certain advance notification requirements as to business that can be brought by a stockholder before annual stockholder meetings and as to persons nominated as directors by a stockholder. As a result of these measures and others, potential acquirers might find it more difficult or be discouraged from attempting to effect an acquisition transaction with us. This may deprive holders of our securities of certain opportunities to sell or otherwise dispose of the securities at above-market prices pursuant to any such transactions. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None.
