Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to other information in this Annual Report on the Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business, because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those mentioned in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition, and the price of our common stock, could be materially adversely affected. 14 Risks Related to Our Operations We have a history of net losses and may incur additional losses in the future. We have a history of net losses. In order for us to achieve and maintain consistent profitability from our operations, we must continue to achieve product revenue at or above current levels. We may increase our operating expenses as we attempt to expand our product lines and acquire other businesses and products. As a result, we may need to increase our revenues significantly to achieve sustainable profitability. We cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve sustainable profitability. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business plan relies on certain assumptions for the market for our products which, if incorrect, may adversely affect our profitability. We believe that various demographics and industry-specific trends will help drive growth in the medical and personal care markets, including: · an aging population with broad medical coverage, increased disposable income and longer life expectancy; · a growing emphasis on physical fitness, leisure sports and conditioning, which will continue to lead to increased injuries; · increasing awareness and use of non-invasive devices for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation purposes; and · an increase in the utilization of personal care products for various applications, including cleansing, cosmetic and for the treatment of various conditions. These demographics and trends are uncertain. The projected demand for our products could materially differ from actual demand if our assumptions regarding these factors prove to be incorrect or do not materialize, or if alternative treatments to those offered by our products gain widespread acceptance. We may face difficulties integrating the operations of Twincraft. We recently completed the acquisition of Twincraft, our largest acquisition to date. Our ability to integrate the operations of Twincraft is subject to various risks, including: · failure to effectively integrate the two companies sales and marketing teams; and · loss of key personnel. If any of these risks were to materialize in the future, we may not be able to realize the sales or research and development synergies or other benefits expected from this acquisition. Our failure to successfully integrate the operations of Twincraft in a timely manner without incurring unexpected costs could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, business, financial condition, and results of operations. There are significant risks associated with our strategy of acquiring and integrating businesses. A key element of our strategy is the acquisition of businesses and assets that will complement our current business, increase size, expand our geographic scope of operations, and otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may not be able to successfully identify attractive acquisition opportunities, obtain financing for acquisitions, make acquisitions on satisfactory terms, or successfully acquire and/or integrate identified targets. Additionally, competition for acquisition opportunities in our industries may escalate, which would increase the costs to us of completing acquisitions or prevent us from making acquisitions. Our ability to implement our acquisition strategy is also subject to other risks and costs, including: · loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of acquired businesses; · diversion of managements time and attention from our core businesses; · adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; · our ability to realize operating efficiencies, synergies, or other benefits expected from an acquisition; 15 · risks associated with entering markets in which we have limited or no experience; and · assumption of contingent or undisclosed liabilities of acquisition targets. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of Regal Medical Supply, LLC on January 8, 2007, and Twincraft, Inc. on January 23, 2007, we face the risk of incurring potential liabilities of those companies which may not be covered by the limited indemnification in the relevant acquisition agreements. The above risks could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to adequately manage our growth. We have expanded, and are seeking to continue to expand, our business. This growth has placed significant demands on our management, administrative, operating and financial resources. The continued growth of our customer base, the types of products offered and the geographic markets served can be expected to continue to place a significant strain on our resources. Personnel qualified in the production and marketing of our products are difficult to find and hire, and enhancements of information technology systems to support growth are difficult to implement. Our future performance and profitability will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional management and other key personnel. In addition, although we have recently implemented a new information technology platform, we cannot assure you that the new system will be effective in accommodating our growing accounting, financial and information needs. Any failure to adequately manage our growth could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. The growth of our personal care business depends on the successful development and introduction of new products and services. The growth of our personal care business depends on the success of existing products and services, including the manufacturing capabilities of our Twincraft subsidiary, as well as the successful development and introduction of new products manufacturing services, which face the uncertainty of customer acceptance and reaction from competitors. In addition, our ability to create new products and new manufacturing services, and to sustain existing products and services, is affected by whether we can: · develop and fund technological innovations; · receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection; · obtain governmental approvals and registrations of regulated products and manufacturing operations; · comply with Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Consumer Product Safety Commission, and other governmental regulations; and · successfully anticipate consumer needs. The failure to develop and launch successful new products and provide new and competitive manufacturing services could hinder the growth of our business. Also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position. Changes in the requirements of our personal care customers and increasing dependence on key customers may adversely affect our business. Our personal care products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which is experiencing increased trade concentration. With the growing trend toward consolidation, we are increasingly dependent on key customers, and some of these customers have greater bargaining strength than we do. They may use this strength to demand lower prices, higher trade discounts, allowances or slotting fees, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. We may also be negatively affected by changes in the requirements of our customers, such as inventory de-stocking, and other conditions. 16 Rising material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability. Raw and packaging material commodities such as resins, tallow, corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations. Increases in the costs of these commodities and other costs, such as energy costs, may adversely affect Twincrafts profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies. A write-off of intangible assets may adversely affect our results of operations. Our total assets include substantial intangible assets, including goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisitions of Benefoot, Bi-Op and Silipos, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired. We expect to incur additional goodwill in connection with other acquisitions we make in the future. We evaluate on a regular basis whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that all or a portion of the carrying amount of the goodwill or other intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to earnings would be required. In the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a provision for impairment totaling $2,102,000, with regard to certain identifiable intangible assets. Our business is highly competitive. If we fail to compete successfully, our sales and operating results may be negatively affected and we may not achieve future growth. The orthopedic, orthotic, prosthetic, skincare and personal care markets are highly competitive. Certain of our competitors in these markets have more resources and experience as well as more recognizable trademarks for products similar to those sold by us. In addition, the market for orthopedic devices and related products is characterized by new product development and corresponding obsolescence of existing products. Our competitors may develop new techniques, therapeutic procedures or alternative products that are more effective than our current technology or products or that render our technology or products obsolete or uncompetitive, which could cause a decrease in orders for our custom orthotic products. Such decreases would have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to develop successful new products or enhance existing products, obtain regulatory clearances and approval of such products, market such products in a commercially viable manner or gain market acceptance for such products. Failure to develop, license or market new products and product enhancements could materially and adversely affect our competitive position, which could cause a significant decline in our sales and profitability. We expect that the level of competition faced by us may increase in the future. Some competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and technical resources than us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the orthopedic, orthotic, prosthetic, skincare and personal care markets. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to raise adequate financing to fund our operations and growth prospects. Our acquisition and product expansion programs, debt servicing requirements, and existing operations will require substantial capital resources. Currently, we do not have a working capital facility or revolving line of credit with a financial institution for additional borrowings. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient operating cash flow or obtain sufficient additional financing to meet these requirements. If we do not have adequate resources and cannot obtain additional capital on terms acceptable to us or at all, we may be required to reduce operating costs by altering and delaying our business plan or otherwise radically altering our business practices. Failure to meet our future capital requirements could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be adversely affected by legal actions or proceedings. On or about February 23, 2006, our Silipos subsidiary commenced an action in New York State Supreme Court, New York County, against Mr. Peter D. Bickel, who was the executive vice president of Silipos, until January 11, 2006. In the action, Silipos sought, among other things, a declaratory judgment that Mr. Bickel is not entitled to severance pay or other benefits, on account of his breach of various provisions of his employment agreement with 17 Silipos and his non-disclosure agreement with Silipos, and that his termination by Silipos was for cause as defined in the employment agreement. Silipos also sought an aggregate of $12 million in compensatory and punitive damages for breaches of the employment agreement, breach of the non-disclosure agreement, breach of fiduciary duties, misappropriation of trade secrets, and tortious interference with business relationships. On or about March 22, 2006, Mr. Bickel removed the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint and counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that his non-disclosure agreement is unenforceable and that he is entitled to $500,000, representing two years base salary, in severance compensation, on the ground that Silipos did not have cause to terminate his employment. Silipos intends to vigorously defend these counterclaims. On August 8, 2006, the court determined that the restrictive covenant was enforceable against Mr. Bickel for the duration of its term (which expired January 11, 2007), to the extent of prohibiting Mr. Bickel from soliciting certain key customers of the Company with whom he had worked during his employment with Silipos. The Company has withdrawn, without prejudice, its claims for compensatory and punitive damages for breaches of the employment agreement, breach of the non-disclosure agreement, breach of fiduciary duties, misappropriation of trade secrets, and tortious interference with business relationships. No assurance can be given that the Company will successfully defend against Mr. Bickels remaining claims. On or about February 13, 2006, Dr. Gerald P. Zook filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association, naming Langer, Inc., and Silipos as 2 of the 16 respondents. (Four of the other respondents are the former owners of Silipos and its affiliates, and the other 10 respondents are unknown entities.) The demand for arbitration alleges that Silipos is in default of obligations to pay royalties in accordance with the terms of a license agreement between Dr. Zook and Silipos dated as of January 1, 1997, with respect to seven patents owned by Dr. Zook and licensed to Silipos. Silipos has paid royalties to Dr. Zook, but Dr. Zook claims that greater royalties are owed. The demand for arbitration seeks an award of $400,000 and reserves the right to seek a higher award after completion of discovery. Dr. Zook has agreed to drop Langer, Inc. (but not Silipos) from the arbitration, without prejudice. On January 26, 2007, the arbitrator gave Silipos (and certain other parties unrelated to the Company) permission to move before the arbitrator for a dismissal against Silipos. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we may be subject to claims and litigation in the areas of general liability, including claims of employees, and claims, litigation or other liabilities as a result of acquisitions we have completed. The results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict and we cannot provide you with any assurance that an action or proceeding will not be commenced against us, or that we will prevail in any such action or proceeding. An unfavorable outcome of the arbitration proceeding commenced by Dr. Gerald P. Zook against us and Silipos, may adversely affect our rights to manufacture and/or sell certain products or raise the royalty costs of those certain products. An unfavorable resolution of any legal action or proceeding could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. Our existing purchasing arrangements may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain good relations with our suppliers. Our ability to sustain our gross margins has been and will continue to be dependent, in part, on our ability to maintain satisfactory terms with the third-party manufacturers of certain raw materials. These terms may be adversely impacted by changes in our suppliers strategies or changes in our relationship with our suppliers. We cannot assure you that we will continue to maintain satisfactory terms with our suppliers. Our inability to maintain such terms, the loss of any of our key suppliers, or any other interruption or delay in the supply of our required materials, or our inability to obtain these materials at acceptable prices or within a reasonable amount of time could impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could hurt our reputation and cause customers to cancel orders. Twincrafts costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices and raw materials. Commodity costs fluctuated in 2006 and there can be no assurance that they will not continue to do so in 2007. Therefore, Twincrafts success is dependent, in part, on our ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings measures (including outsourcing), and sourcing decisions. In the manufacturing and general overhead areas, Twincraft needs to maintain key supply arrangements, including sole supplier arrangements. Raw and packaging material commodities such as resins, tallow, corn and soybeans used in Twincrafts operations are subject to wide price variations. Increases in the costs of these commodities and other costs, such as energy costs, 18 may adversely affect Twincrafts profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies. We rely heavily on our relationships with healthcare practitioners, agents and distributors for marketing our products, and our failure to maintain these relationships could adversely affect our business. The sales of our products depend significantly on the prescription or recommendation of such products by podiatrists, orthopedists, orthopedic surgeons, dermatologists, cosmetic and plastic surgeons, occupational and physical rehabilitation professionals, prosthetists, orthotists and other healthcare professionals. Failure of our products to retain the support of these surgeons and other specialists, or the failure of our products to secure and retain similar support from leading surgeons and other specialists, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operation. Our marketing success also depends largely upon arrangements with agents and distributors. Our success depends upon our agents and distributors sales and service expertise and their relationships with the customers in the marketplace. Our failure to maintain relationships with our agents and distributors for marketing our products could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. We enter into multi-year contracts with customers that can impact our results. We enter into multi-year contracts with some of our customers which include terms affecting our pricing flexibility. There can be no assurance that these restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and operating income. While we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 3.8% percent or more of our consolidated revenues, we do have customers and independent, third-party distributors, the loss of which could have a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations. The nature of our business could subject us to potential product liability and other claims. The sale of orthotic and prosthetic products and other biomechanical devices and personal care products entails the potential risk of physical injury to patients and other end users and an inherent risk of product liability, lawsuits and product recalls. We currently maintain product liability insurance with coverage limits of $11 million per occurrence and for an annual aggregate maximum subject to a deductible of $25,000. However, we cannot assure you that this coverage would be sufficient to cover the payment of any potential claim. In addition, we cannot assure you that this or any other insurance coverage will continue to be available or, if available, will be obtainable at a reasonable cost. Our existing product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur, and we will continue to be exposed to the risk that our claims may be excluded and that our insurers may become insolvent. A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us for uninsured liabilities or liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as a result of a product liability claim, our reputation could be harmed and we may have to recall some of our products, which could result in significant costs to us and have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Health care regulations or health care reform initiatives could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our businesses are subject to governmental regulation and supervision in the United States at the federal and state levels and abroad. These regulations include regulations of the FDA of our medical and personal care products, and regulations regarding Medicare, Medicaid and physician self-referrals for certain of our medical devices and products. Our newly acquired soap manufacturing business (which is part of our personal care segment) is also subject to regulation by the CPSC. These regulations are far-reaching, and we may be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws. For example, we may be required to obtain regulatory approvals and otherwise comply with regulations regarding safety, quality and efficacy standards of our medical products, and safety and manufacturing practices of our soap products. If we fail to obtain such approvals and otherwise comply with applicable regulatory requirements that could result in government authorities taking punitive actions against us, including, among other things, imposing fines and penalties on us or preventing us from manufacturing or selling our products. Health care fraud and abuse regulations are complex, and even minor, 19 inadvertent irregularities in submissions can potentially give rise to claims that the statute has been violated. Any violations of these laws could result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that these laws and regulations will not change or be interpreted in the future in a manner which restricts or adversely affects our business activities or relationships with providers of orthotic and biomechanical products. Changes in government and other third-party payer reimbursement levels could adversely affect the revenues and profitability of our medical segment. Our medical products are sold by us through our network of national, regional, independent and international distributors, hospitals, doctors and other healthcare providers, many of whom are reimbursed for the healthcare services provided to their patients by third-party payers, such as government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Many of these programs set maximum reimbursement levels for certain of the products sold by us in the United States. We may be unable to sell our products through our distribution channels on a profitable basis if third-party payers deny coverage or reduce their current levels of reimbursement, or if our costs of production increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels. The percentage of our sales dependent on Medicare or other insurance programs may increase as the portion of the United States population over age 65 continues to grow, making us more vulnerable to reimbursement level reductions by these organizations. Reduced government reimbursement levels could result in reduced private payer reimbursement levels because of indexing of Medicare fee schedules by certain third-party payers. Furthermore, the healthcare industry is experiencing a trend towards cost containment as government and private insurers seek to contain healthcare costs by imposing lower reimbursement rates and negotiating reduced contract rates with service providers. Outside the United States, reimbursement systems vary significantly by country. Many foreign markets have government-managed health care systems that govern reimbursement for new devices and procedures. The ability of hospitals supported by such systems to purchase our products is dependent, in part, upon public budgetary constraints. Canada and some European countries, for example, have tightened reimbursement rates. If adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payers outside of the United States are not obtained, international sales of our products may decline, which could adversely affect our net sales and could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business is subject to substantial government regulation relating to medical products that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Government regulation in the United States and other countries is a significant factor affecting the research, development, formulation, manufacture and marketing of our products. In the United States, the FDA has broad authority to regulate the design, manufacture, formulation, marketing and sale of medical devices, and other medical products, and many of our personal care products, and the CPSC and the FTC has broad authority over product advertising. Overseas, these activities are subject to foreign governmental regulation, which is in many respects similar to regulation in the United States but which vary from country to country. United States and foreign regulation continues to evolve, which could result in additional burdens on our operations. If we fail to comply with applicable regulations we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution. Additionally, the cost of maintaining personnel and systems necessary to comply with applicable regulations is substantial and increasing. Some of our products may require or will require regulatory approval prior to being marketed. The process of obtaining these approvals can be lengthy and expensive. We may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary approvals for testing or marketing our products. Moreover, regulatory approvals, if granted, may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which our products may be marketed or other restrictions or requirements that reduce the value to us of the products. Regulatory authorities may also withdraw product approvals if we fail to comply with regulatory standards or if any problems related to our products develop following initial marketing. We are also subject to strict regulation with respect to our manufacturing operations. This regulation includes testing, control and documentation requirements, and compliance with current good manufacturing practices, which is monitored through inspections by regulatory authorities. Our profitability depends, in part, upon our and our distributors ability to obtain and maintain all necessary certificates, permits, approvals and clearances from the United States and foreign regulatory authorities and to 20 operate in compliance with applicable regulations. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to receive necessary approvals, the loss of previously obtained approvals, or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Modifications to our marketed devices may require FDA regulatory clearances or approvals and may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified devices until such clearances or approvals are obtained. When required, the products we market in the United States have been subjected to Pre-market Notification requirements under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food Drug & Cosmetics Act or were exempt from the 510(k) Pre-market Notification process. We have modified some of our products and product labeling since obtaining 510(k) clearance. If the FDA requires us to submit a new 510(k) Pre-market Notification for modifications to our existing products, we may be the subject of enforcement actions by the FDA and be required to stop marketing the products while the FDA reviews the 510(k) Pre-market Notification. If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination than we expect, our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our sales to decline or otherwise adversely impact our growth. In addition, the FDA may determine that future products will be subject to the more costly, lengthy and uncertain Pre-market Approval, or PMA, process. Products that are approved through the PMA process generally need FDA approval before they may be modified. Our products may be subject to product recalls even after receiving clearance or approval, which would harm our reputation and our business. The FDA, the CPSC and foreign regulatory authorities have the authority to request and, in some cases, require the recall of products in the event of material deficiencies, design defects or manufacturing defects or consumer complaints which are substantiated by the CPSC. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design defects, or any other incidents related to our medical devices, including, but not limited to, adverse event recalls, cease and desist communications and any other product liability issues related to our medical devices. Any product recall would divert managerial and financial resources and harm our reputation with customers and our business. If we fail to comply with the FDAs Quality System Regulation, our manufacturing could be delayed, and our product sales and profitability could suffer. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the FDAs Quality System Regulation, which covers the procedures concerning (and documentation of) the design, testing, production processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of our devices. We also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices. In addition, we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies, including the FDA, state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries. Moreover, failure to pass a Quality System Regulation inspection or to comply with these and other applicable regulatory requirements could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays. Failure to take adequate corrective action could result in, among other things, significant fines, suspension of approvals, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. We cannot assure you that the FDA or other governmental authorities would agree with our interpretation of applicable regulatory requirements or that we have in all instances fully complied with all applicable requirements. Any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability. Loss of the services of key management personnel could adversely affect our business. Our operations are dependent upon the skill, experience and performance of a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel, including our Chairman, our President and Chief Executive Officer and head of our personal care business segment. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of key management and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. 21 We are currently in the process of filling a vacancy in the position of Chief Financial Officer. The person who served as the Companys Chief Financial Officer commencing in February 2004 resigned in September 2006, and the person whom the Company hired as his replacement resigned in early December 2006. The Company has been engaged in a search for a new Chief Financial Officer since that time but, to date, has not located a suitable candidate. The Company has engaged independent consultants to perform many of the duties of the Chief Financial Officer, at a cost greater than the cost of a full-time chief financial officer. In the absence of a full-time Chief Financial Officer, other senior executives have had to devote portions of their time to the financial affairs of the Company, including matters relating to internal financial controls. This has resulted in increased costs to the Company and dilution of the efforts of the senior executives of the Company on the Companys business, and this is expected to continue until a suitable candidate for Chief Financial Officer has been hired. The continuing absence of a Chief Financial Officer may adversely affect the Companys ability to fulfill its financial reporting and disclosure obligations. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we become involved in litigation regarding our patents or other intellectual property rights. The orthopedic, orthotic, prosthetics and personal care product industries have experienced extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies in this industry have used intellectual property litigation in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage. Our products may become subject to patent infringement claims or litigation or interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO), or the foreign equivalents thereto to determine the priority of inventions, by competitors or other companies. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, USPTO interference proceedings or the foreign equivalents thereto and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming. An adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could: · subject us to significant liabilities to third-parties; · require disputed rights to be licensed from a third-party for royalties that may be substantial; · require us to cease manufacturing, using or selling such products or technology; or · result in the invalidation or loss of our patent rights. Any one of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. Even if we are able to enter into licensing arrangements, costs associated with these transactions may be substantial and could include the long-term payment of royalties. Accordingly, adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or our failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, or from using certain processes to make our products which would have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, even if we are successful in such litigation, the expense of defending such claims could be material. In addition, we may in the future need to litigate to enforce our patents, to protect our trade secrets or know-how or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Such enforcement of our intellectual property rights could involve counterclaims against us. Any future litigation or interference proceedings may result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel. Intellectual property litigation relating to our products could also cause our customers or potential customers to defer or limit their purchases of our products, or cause healthcare professionals, agents and distributors to cease or lessen their support and marketing of our products. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Silipos, we may be subject to the Potential Poly-Gel Claims discussed under Item 3. Legal Proceedings, including intellectual property claims, brought by Poly-Gel. For any of these potential claims, SSL has generally agreed to indemnify us for losses up to $2.0 million, after which we would be liable for any such claims. For claims arising out of conduct that occurs after the closing of the Silipos transaction on September 30, 2004, we have agreed to indemnify SSL against losses. We would expect to vigorously defend against any claims brought by Poly-Gel. However, if such claims were brought, we may not ultimately prevail. 22 We may not be able to maintain the confidentiality, or assure the protection, of our proprietary technology. We hold or have the exclusive right to use a variety of patents, trademarks and copyrights in several countries, including the United States that we are dependent on, including approximately 35 patents and patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions and a number of trademarks for technologies and brands related to our product offerings. The ownership of a patent or an interest in a patent does not always provide significant protection, and the patents and patent applications in which we have an interest may be challenged as to their validity or enforceability. Others may independently develop similar technologies or design around the patented aspects of our technology. Challenges may result in potentially significant harm to our business. We are also dependent upon a variety of methods and technologies that we regard as proprietary trade secrets. In addition, we have (i) a non-exclusive, paid up (except for certain administrative fees) license with Applied Elastomerics, Incorporated (the AEI License) dated as of November 30, 2001, as amended, to manufacture and sell certain products using mineral oil based gels under certain patents, during the life of such patents, and (ii) a license with Gerald Zook (the Zook License), effective as of January 1, 1997, to manufacture and sell certain products using mineral oil based gels under certain patents and know how, during the life of such patents, in exchange for sales based royalty payments, that is exclusive as to certain products but is non-exclusive as to others. We also have exclusive licenses to three types of orthotic devices which are patented in the United States and several foreign countries. We believe our trademarks and trade names, including Langer™, Sporthotics™, PPT™, Silipos™, Explorer Gel Liner™, Siloliner™, and Silopad™, contribute significantly to brand recognition for our products, and the inability to use one or more of these names could have a material adverse affect on our business. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, revenues generated by the products incorporating the technology licensed under the AEI License accounted for approximately 36.4% and 40.2% of our revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, revenues generated by products covered by the Zook License, as we understand the Zook License, accounted for approximately 8.7% and 23.9% of our revenues. In 2006, Dr. Gerald P. Zook, the licensor of the Zook License, commenced an arbitration proceeding alleging that a broader range of products sold by us are covered by the Zook License and that more license fees are payable by us under the Zook License, but he subsequently discontinued the arbitration against the Company with prejudice. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings. We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, patent, trademark, unfair competition and other intellectual property laws as well as contractual agreements to protect our rights to such intellectual property. Due to the difficulty of monitoring unauthorized use of and access to intellectual property, however, such measures may not provide adequate protection. There can be no assurance that courts will always uphold our intellectual property rights, or enforce the contractual arrangements that we have entered into to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets. Further, although we seek to protect our trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology, in part, with confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees and consultants, we cannot assure you that: · these confidentiality agreements will not be breached; · we will have adequate remedies for any breach; · we will not be required to disclose such information to the FDA or other governmental agency in order for us to have the right to market a product; or · trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors. Any finding of unenforceability, invalidity, non-infringement, or misappropriation of our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we bring or become subject to litigation to defend against claimed infringement of our rights or of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of our intellectual property rights, such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. Unfavorable results in such litigation could also result in the loss or compromise of our proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses from third parties, or prevent us from selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our licenses, including the AEI License and the Zook License, could be terminated under a variety of circumstances including for material breach of the license agreements or in the event of the bankruptcy or 23 insolvency of the licensor. Any such termination could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. A portion of our revenues and expenditures is subject to exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely affect our reported results of operations. While a majority of our business is denominated in United States dollars, we maintain operations in foreign countries, primarily the United Kingdom and Canada that require payments in the local currency and payments received from customers for goods sold in these countries are typically in the local currency. Consequently, fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the United States dollar and certain other currencies may affect our results of operations and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results. For example, the value of the U.S. dollar has fallen over the last year relative to the British pound and the Canadian dollar (which are the principal foreign currencies material to our business) causing an increase in our reported revenues when we convert the higher valued foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. If the value of the U.S. dollar were to increase in relation to those currencies in the future, there could be a negative effect on the value of our sales in those markets when we convert amounts to dollars when we prepare our financial statements. We do not engage in hedging or similar transactions to reduce these risks. We may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials that we use. Our research and development and manufacturing processes involve the use of hazardous materials. We are subject to federal, state and local regulation governing the use, manufacture, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials or waste. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials or waste, and we may incur liability as a result of any contamination or injury. In addition, under some environmental laws and regulations, we could also be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites even if such contamination was not caused by us. We may incur significant expenses in the future relating to any failure to comply with environmental laws. Any such future expenses or liability could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations. Our revenue and operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal factors and for other reasons. Revenues derived from our sales of orthotic devices has historically been significantly higher in North America in the warmer months of the year, while sales of orthotic devices in the United Kingdom has not historically experienced seasonality. We believe that this seasonality in North America results from the portion of our orthotics sales comprised of custom sandals which tend to be higher in the spring and summer months. Our experience has also been that physical activities in general tend to increase in warmer weather and that many patients of our customers in the healthcare profession tend to defer healthcare purchases until the spring months. Other factors which can result in quarterly variations include the timing and amount of new business generated by us, the timing of new product introductions, our revenue mix, acquisitions, the timing of additional selling and general and administrative expenses to support the anticipated growth and development of new business units and the competitive and fluctuating economic conditions in the orthopedic industry. Quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of likely future performance or annual operating results. Reductions in revenues or net income between quarters could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. We may be unable to realize the benefits of our net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards. NOLs may be carried forward to offset federal and state taxable income in future years and eliminate income taxes otherwise payable on such taxable income, subject to certain adjustments. Based on current federal corporate income tax rates, our NOL could provide a benefit to us, if fully utilized, of significant future tax savings. However, our ability to use these tax benefits in future years will depend upon the amount of our otherwise taxable income. If we do not have sufficient taxable income in future years to use the tax benefits before they expire, we will lose the benefit of these NOL carryforwards permanently. Additionally, future utilization of net operating losses will be limited under existing tax law due to the change in control of Langer in 2001 and may be further limited as a result of pending or future offerings of our common stock. 24 The amount of NOL carryforwards that we have claimed to date of approximately $9,800 has not been audited or otherwise validated by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS). The IRS could challenge our calculation of the amount of our NOL or any deductions or losses included in such calculation, and provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to carry forward our NOL to offset taxable income in future years. If the IRS were successful with respect to any challenge in respect of the amount of our NOL, the potential tax benefit of the NOL carryforwards to us could be substantially reduced. Changes in accounting standards regarding stock option plans, which became applicable to the Company as of January 1, 2006, could limit the desirability of granting stock options, which could harm our ability to attract and retain employees, and could also negatively impact our results of operations. A change in accounting standards (Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment), which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion (ABP) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. SFAS No. 123(R) requires all public companies to account for the fair value of stock options granted to employees as an expense effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. In 2006, this amount was $186,322. Prior to 2006, we were generally not required to record stock compensation expense in connection with stock option grants, since grants had an exercise price equal to or greater than market. However, in 2005, the Company did have substantial non-cash charges due to certain stock option modifications. The requirement to expense stock options may reduce the attractiveness to us of granting stock options because of the additional expense associated with these grants, which would negatively impact our reported results of operations. For example, if we had been required to expense stock option grants in accordance with the revised rule, our recorded net loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 of approximately $4,557,000 would have been increased by approximately $2,837,000 (of which approximately $766,000 would have represented periodic expense relating to employee stock options granted and $2,071,000 would have represented expenses relating to the acceleration of the vesting of certain options to a net loss of approximately $7,394,000; and for the year ended December 31, 2004, our recorded net income of approximately $375,000 would have been reduced by approximately $521,000, to a net loss of approximately $146,000. Nevertheless, stock options are an important employee recruitment and retention tool, and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel if we reduce the scope of our employee stock option program. Accordingly, when we grant options in the future, our future results of operations will be negatively impacted, as could our willingness to use stock options as an employee recruitment and retention tool. We are seeking approval from our common stockholders of the issuance of shares issuable upon conversion of our outstanding 5% convertible subordinated notes. The Company issued an aggregate of $28,880,000 principal amount of its 5% convertible subordinated notes due December 7, 2011 (the 5% Convertible Notes), pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated as of December 8, 2006 (the Note Purchase Agreement). The 5% Convertible Notes would be convertible into 6,183,359 shares (the Conversion Shares), but for the agreement of certain holders of the 5% Convertible Notes, in the aggregate amount of approximately $24,000,000, not to convert their Notes prior to obtaining stockholder approval of the Notes. The Company expects to call a special meeting of stockholders (the Special Meeting) for the purpose of obtaining stockholder approval of the issuance of the Conversion Shares, and the Company has obtained agreements from holders of approximately 46% of the Companys outstanding common stock to vote to approve the issuance of the Conversion Shares. If we do not obtain stockholder approval of this proposal, the holders of a principal amount of approximately $24,000,000 Notes, or approximately 83% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, will not be able to convert their Notes into shares of our common stock, and such principal amounts will remain outstanding. If we do not have adequate cash resources to repay these Notes when they come due, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected. Risks Related to Our Common Stock One stockholder has the ability to significantly influence the election of our directors and the outcome of corporate action requiring stockholder approval. As of March 29, 2007, Warren B. Kanders, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, in his capacity as sole manager and voting member of Langer Partners, LLC (Langer Partners) and the sole stockholder of Kanders & 25 Company, Inc., may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 2,925,075 shares, or approximately 23.5% of our outstanding common stock. Of this amount, 1,866,856 shares are issued and outstanding, and the balance is acquirable under options, warrants and convertible notes. (This amount does not include a restricted stock award of 500,000 shares, which presently will vest only if and when the Company has earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of at least $10,000,000 in any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, commencing with the quarter beginning January 1, 2007). As of March 27, 2007, current executive officers and directors, including Mr. Kanders, beneficially own an aggregate of 4,598,500 shares, or approximately 34.9% of our outstanding common stock. Consequently, Mr. Kanders, acting alone or together with our other officers and directors, has the ability to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, such as a change in control. The price of our common stock has been and is expected to continue to be volatile, which could affect a stockholders return on investment. There has been significant volatility in the stock market and in particular in the market price and trading volume of securities of orthopedic and other health care companies, which has often been unrelated to the performance of the companies. The market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations, and we expect it to continue to be subject to such fluctuations for the foreseeable future. We believe the reasons for these fluctuations include, in addition to general market volatility, the relatively thin level of trading in our stock, and the relatively low public float. Therefore, variations in financial results, announcements of material events, technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, our quarterly operating results, changes in general conditions in the economy or the health care industry, other developments affecting us or our competitors or general price and volume fluctuations in the market are among the many factors that could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. Shares of our common stock have been thinly traded in the past. Although a trading market for our common stock exists, the trading volume has not been significant and there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or, if developed, be sustained in the future. As a result of the thin trading market or float for our stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large float, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. In the absence of an active public trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate his investment in our common stock. Trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger. We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade in the future. Our common stock is currently traded on The NASDAQ Global Market. We may issue a substantial amount of our common stock in the future which could cause dilution to investors and otherwise adversely affect our stock price. A key element of our growth strategy is to make acquisitions. As part of our acquisition strategy, we may issue additional shares of common stock as consideration for such acquisitions. These issuances could be significant. To the extent that we make acquisitions and issue our shares of common stock as consideration stockholders interest may be diluted. Any such issuance will also increase the number of outstanding shares of common stock that will be eligible for sale in the future. Persons receiving shares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions may be more likely to sell off their common stock than other investors, which may influence the price of our common stock. In addition, the potential issuance of additional shares in connection with anticipated acquisitions could lessen demand for our common stock and result in a lower price than might otherwise be obtained. We may issue common stock in the future for other purposes as well, including in connection with financings, for compensation purposes, in connection with strategic transactions or for other purposes. In January 2007, we issued 999,375 shared of our common stock as part of the consideration we paid for the Twincraft acquisition, and we may issue additional shares in 2008 and 2009 if Twincraft achieves certain performance targets which entitle the sellers of Twincraft to additional considerations. In January 2007, we also issued 379,167 shares in connection with the Regal acquisition. 26 We have a significant amount of convertible indebtedness outstanding and may issue a substantial amount of our common stock in connection with these and other outstanding securities and in connection with future acquisitions and our growth plans; any such issuances of additional shares could adversely affect our stock price. On December 8, 2006, we sold $28,880,000 of our 5% Convertible Notes in a private placement. At the date of issuance, the 5% Convertible Notes were convertible into 6,080,000 shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $4.75 per share. As a result of the anti-dilution provisions of the 5% Convertible Notes and the issuance of 999,375 shares of common stock in the Twincraft acquisition and 379,167 shares in the Regal acquisition, both of which closed in January 2007, the 5% Convertible Notes are now convertible into 6,183,359 shares of our common stock, at a conversion price, as adjusted, of $4.6706 per share, subject to further adjustment in certain circumstances. The conversion of the 5% Convertible Notes could result in dilution in the value of the shares of our outstanding stock and the voting power represented thereby. The effect of the conversion of all of our outstanding 5% Convertible Notes would be to increase outstanding shares and dilute current shareholders by approximately 54.0% at March 15, 2007. In addition, the conversion price of our 5% Convertible Notes may be lowered under the conversion price adjustment provisions of the notes in certain circumstances, including if we issue common stock at a net price per share less than the conversion price then in effect or if we issue rights, warrants or options entitling the recipients to subscribe for or purchase shares of our common stock at a price per share less than the conversion price (after taking into account any consideration we received for such rights, warrants or options). A reduction in the conversion price may result in the issuance of an additional number of shares upon the conversion of our 5% Convertible Notes. We also have a significant number of stock options and warrants outstanding, and restricted stock awards which would vest if we achieve certain performance targets. We anticipate issuing additional shares of our common stock and may also issue additional securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock to finance acquisitions or for other reasons in the future. The number of outstanding shares of our common stock that will be eligible for sale in the future is, therefore, likely to increase substantially. Persons receiving shares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions or financings may be more likely to sell large quantities of their common stock, which may adversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, the potential issuance of additional shares in connection with anticipated acquisitions could lessen demand for our common stock and result in a lower price than would otherwise be obtained. If our security holders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could fall. These sales might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate and may require us to issue greater amounts of our common stock to finance acquisitions. Additional shares sold to finance acquisitions and conversions, exercises and exchanges of other securities for common stock may also dilute our earnings per share. Our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a takeover attempt. We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits publicly-held Delaware corporations to which it applies from engaging in a business combination (generally including mergers, consolidations and sales of 10% or more of the corporations assets) with an interested stockholder (generally defined as a person owning 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation, subject to certain exceptions) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. This provision could discourage others from bidding for our shares and could, as a result, reduce the likelihood of an increase in our stock price that would otherwise occur if a bidder sought to buy our stock. It could also discourage, delay or prevent another company from merging with us or acquiring us, even if our stockholders were to consider such a merger or acquisition to be favorable. Additionally, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 250,000 shares of preferred stock, and to determine the price, rights, preferences and restrictions, including voting and conversion rights, of those shares without any further action or vote by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. Such provisions could adversely affect the holders of common stock in a variety of ways, including by potentially discouraging, delaying or preventing a takeover of us and by diluting our earnings per share. 27 We do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently do not intend to pay any dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any earnings for working capital, repayment of indebtedness, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable.
