Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Operations. 72 Table of Contents Impact of Changes in Interest Rates Interest rates may fluctuate upon changes in financial market conditions and material changes can affect our results of operations and financial condition, since these changes can impact the total interest income received on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, as well as the total interest expense paid on our financial debt. Our interest income (expense), net, as reported in our consolidated statements of income, is the balance between interest income received from our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities investments and interest expense paid on our financial liabilities and bank fees (including fees on committed credit lines). Our interest income is dependent upon fluctuations in interest rates, mainly in U.S. dollars and Euros, since we invest primarily on a short-term basis; any increase or decrease in the market interest rates would mean an equivalent increase or decrease in our interest income. Our interest expense is mainly associated with long- and short-term debt, which mainly consists of our 2013 Senior Bonds, which is reset quarterly at a rate of three-month Euribor plus 40bps, and European Investment Bank Floating Rate Loans at three-month Libor and Euribor plus variable spreads. Our 2016 Convertible Bond was almost entirely repaid to the bondholders in the first quarter of 2012 upon the exercise of the put option and fully redeemed in the second quarter of 2012. At December 31, 2012, our total financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, generated an average interest income rate of 0.19%. At the same date, the average interest rate on our outstanding debt was 0.81%. Impact of Changes in Equity Prices As of December 31, 2012, we did not hold any significant equity participations, which could be subject to a material impact in changes in equity prices. However, we hold equity participations whose carrying value could be lower due to further losses or impairment charges of our equity-method investments. Liquidity and Capital Resources Treasury activities are regulated by our policies, which define procedures, objectives and controls. The policies focus on the management of our financial risk in terms of exposure to currency rates and interest rates. Most treasury activities are centralized, with any local treasury activities subject to oversight from our head treasury office. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held in U.S. dollars and Euros and are placed with financial institutions rated at least a single A long-term rating, meaning at least A3 from Moodys Investor Service (Moodys) and A- from Standard & Poors (S&Ps) or Fitch Ratings (Fitch), or better. Marginal amounts are held in other currencies. See Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our total liquidity and capital resources were $2,493 million as of December 31, 2012, increasing compared to $2,333 million at December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2012, our total liquidity and capital resources were comprised of $2,250 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $37 million was held at the ST-Ericsson level, $1 million in short-term deposits and $238 million in marketable securities, all considered as current assets. Additionally, in order to reconcile with our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012, we had $4 million as restricted cash in an escrow account related to the disposal of the Numonyx investment. As of December 31, 2012, marketable securities were $238 million held by us as current assets of which $150 million invested in treasury bills from the U.S. government and $88 million invested in senior debt issued by primary financial institutions with an average rating of A-/Baa1/A from Moodys, S&Ps and Fitch, respectively. Both the treasury bills and the marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of equity, except if deemed to be other-than-temporary. We reported as of December 31, 2012, a before tax increase of $6 million compared to December 31, 2011, in the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio. Since the duration of the marketable securities portfolio is only an average of one year, we expect the value of the securities to return to par as the final maturity approaches. The fair value of these securities is based on market prices publicly available through major financial information providers. The market price of the marketable securities is influenced by changes in the credit standing of the issuer but is not significantly impacted by movement in interest rates. In 2012, we invested $450 million in U.S. treasury bills. In addition, we reported proceeds of $481 million during the year 2012 pursuant to sold or matured treasury bills. The change in fair value of the $150 million government debt securities classified as available-for-sale was not material at December 31, 2012. The average duration of the treasury bills portfolio is less than five months and the securities are rated Aaa by Moodys. 73 Table of Contents In 2007, we had $415 million of Auction Rate Securities (ARS), representing interests in collateralized debt obligations and credit linked notes invested by Credit Suisse without our authorization. In 2008, we launched a legal action against Credit Suisse. In December 2009, Credit Suisse, because of its contingent interest in certain securities held by us and issued by Deutsche Bank, requested that we tender the securities. Pursuant to legal advice, and while reserving our legal rights, we participated in the tender offer. As a result, we sold ARS with a face value of $154 million, collected $75 million and registered $68 million as realized losses on financial assets. On June 9, 2011, we received cash proceeds of $356.8 million from Credit Suisse as the full and final payment for the settlement of all outstanding litigation concerning ARS. Upon receipt of the funds, the ownership of the whole portfolio was transferred to Credit Suisse. We booked a pre-tax gain of approximately $329 million in the second quarter of 2011 as a result of the settlement, out of which $6 million was reported on the line selling, general and administrative and $323 million as a realized gain on financial assets. This $356.8 million plus the $75 million already cashed in makes a total amount of $431.8 million that exceeds all losses and costs associated with the litigation. Liquidity We maintain a significant cash position and a low debt-to-equity ratio, which provide us with adequate financial flexibility. As in the past, our cash management policy is to finance our investment needs mainly with net cash generated from operating activities. During 2012, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $338 million, due to the net cash from operating activities and financing activities exceeding the net cash used in investing activities. The components of our cash flow for the last three years are set forth below: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (In millions) Net cash from operating activities $ 612 $ 880 $ 1,794 Net cash used in investing activities (396 ) (287 ) (526 ) Net cash from (used in) financing activities 135 (529 ) (876 ) Effect of changes in exchange rates (13 ) (44 ) (88 ) Net cash increase $ 338 $ 20 $ 304 Net cash from operating activities. The net cash from operating activities in 2012 was $612 million, decreasing compared to the prior year period mainly due to the overall deterioration of our financial results (see  Results of Operations above for more information). Net cash from operating activities is the sum of (i) net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash items and (ii) changes in assets and liabilities. The decrease in net cash from operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 resulted from:  Net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash items significantly reduced to $109 million of cash generated in 2012 compared to $965 million in the prior year period, due to the deteriorated operating results mainly at ST-Ericsson;  Changes in assets and liabilities generated cash for a total amount of $503 million in 2012, compared to $85 million of cash used in the prior year period. The changes in 2012 were represented by a positive trend in all the components of assets and liabilities, mainly associated with a favorable variation in inventories ($191 million) and trade payables ($148 million). In 2011, changes were negative, mainly due to trade payables with a negative change by $384 million. Furthermore, 2012 also included a favorable net cash impact of $26 million, deriving from the non-recourse factoring of trade and other receivables, mainly done by ST-Ericsson, while the same impact in 2011 was $43 million. Net cash used in investing activities. Investing activities used $396 million of cash in 2012, mainly due to payments for the purchase of tangible assets and for investment in intangible and financial assets, partially offset by the net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities. Payments for purchase of tangible assets, net of proceeds, totaled $476 million, reflecting a significant decrease in our capital expenditures in 2012 compared to $1,258 million registered in 2011. This decrease in capital expenditures reflected our action to mitigate the weakening overall impact of the semiconductor industry. Net cash from (used in) financing activities. Net cash generated from financing activities was $135 million in 2012 compared to $529 million used in 2011, since 2012 benefited from an increase in the proceeds from 74 Table of Contents long-term debt, mainly associated with new financing from the European Investment Bank. Moreover, the financing activities in 2012 included $355 million as dividends paid to stockholders, compared to $327 million paid in 2011. Free Cash Flow (non U.S. GAAP measure). We also present Free Cash Flow, which is a non U.S. GAAP measure, defined as (i) net cash from operating activities plus (ii) net cash used in investing activities, excluding payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities, short-term deposits and restricted cash, which are considered as temporary financial investments. The result of this definition is ultimately net cash from operating activities plus payment for purchase of tangible and intangible assets, net proceeds from sales of stock received on investment divestitures and payment for business acquisitions. We believe Free Cash Flow, a non U.S. GAAP measure, provides useful information for investors and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating activities to sustain our operating investing activities. Free Cash Flow is not a U.S. GAAP measure and does not represent total cash flow since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities. Free Cash Flow reconciles with the total cash flow and the net cash increase (decrease) by including the payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities, short-term deposits and restricted cash, the net cash from (used in) financing activities and the effect of changes in exchange rates. In addition, our definition of Free Cash Flow may differ from definitions used by other companies. Free Cash Flow is determined as follows from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (In millions) Net cash from operating activities $ 612 $ 880 $ 1,794 Net cash used in investing activities (396 ) (287 ) (526 ) Excluding: Payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of marketable securities, short-term deposits and restricted cash, net(1) (183 ) (881 ) (307 ) Payment for purchase of tangible and intangible assets, net proceeds from sales of stock received on investment divestitures and payment for business acquisitions(2) (579 ) (1,168 ) (833 ) Free Cash Flow (non U.S. GAAP measure) $ 33 $ (288 ) $ 961 (1) Reflects the total of the following line items reconciled with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows relating to temporary financial investments of our liquidity: Payment for purchase of marketable securities, Proceeds from sale of marketable securities, Proceeds from settlement of non-current marketable securities, Investment in short-term deposits, Proceeds from matured short-term deposits, Restricted cash and Release of restricted cash. (2) Reflects the total of the following line items reconciled with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows relating to the operating investing activities: Payment for purchase of tangible assets, Proceeds from sale of tangible assets, Investment in intangible and financial assets, Proceeds from sale of intangible and financial assets, Net proceeds from sale of stock received on investment divestiture and Payment for business acquisitions, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired. Free Cash Flow was positive by $33 million in 2012, since the $612 million net cash from operating activities exceeded the total amount of $579 million used for purchases of tangible, intangible and financial assets. Free Cash Flow in 2012 improved compared to negative $288 million in 2011, which was using cash for a significantly higher level of capital expenditures. The net cash generated by operating activities declined compared to last year, largely due to the deterioration of our operating results. Our 2012 Free Cash Flow benefited from a significantly lower amount of capital expenditures, net of proceeds, which amounted to $476 million, compared to $1,258 million in 2011. Capital Resources Net Financial Position (non U.S. GAAP measure). Our Net Financial Position represents the balance between our total financial resources and our total financial debt. Our total financial resources include cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current marketable securities, short-term deposits and restricted cash, and our total financial debt includes bank overdrafts, short-term debt and long-term debt, as represented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net Financial Position is not a U.S. GAAP measure but we believe it provides useful information for investors because it gives evidence of our global position either in terms of net indebtedness or net cash by measuring our capital resources based on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and the total level of our financial indebtedness, which includes the 50% of ST-Ericsson indebtedness. 75 Table of Contents Moreover, we also present the Net Financial Position attributable to ST (ST Net Financial Position), which does not include the ST-Ericsson indebtedness towards Ericsson, our partner in the JVS joint venture. Our Net Financial Position for each period has been determined as follows from our Consolidated Balance Sheets: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,250 $ 1,912 $ 1,892 Marketable securities, current 238 413 891 Restricted cash 4 8  Short-term deposits 1  67 Marketable securities, non-current   72 Total financial resources 2,493 2,333 2,922 Bank overdrafts and short-term debt (630 ) (740 ) (720 ) Long-term debt (671 ) (826 ) (1,050 ) Total financial debt (1,301 ) (1,566 ) (1,770 ) Net Financial Position 1,192 767 1,152 ST-Ericsson net debt to Ericsson  400 75 ST Net Financial Position $ 1,192 $ 1,167 $ 1,227 Our ST Net Financial Position as of December 31, 2012 was a net cash position of $1,192 million, slightly increasing compared to the net cash position of $1,167 million at December 31, 2011. Total financial resources increased compared to 2011 mainly following the positive free cash flow and the proceeds from the new long-term loan, while the total financial debt decreased mainly due to a lower amount of short-term borrowings following the forgiveness of the debt due from ST-Ericsson to Ericsson. Our ST Net Financial Position in 2011 and 2010 excluded ST-Ericsson net debt to Ericsson, which was the loan provided by our partner to fund ST-Ericsson. At December 31, 2012, our financial debt was $1,301 million, composed of (i) $630 million of current portion of long-term debt and (ii) $671 million of long-term debt. The breakdown of our total financial debt included: (i) $462 million of our 2013 Senior Bonds, (ii) $815 million in European Investment Bank loans (the EIB Loans), (iii) $19 million in loans from other funding programs, and (iv) $5 million of capital leases. The EIB Loans represent three long-term amortizing credit facilities as part of R&D funding programs. The first, for R&D in France, was drawn in U.S. dollars from 2006 to 2008, for a total amount of $341 million, of which $145 million remained outstanding as at December 31, 2012. The second, for R&D projects in Italy, was drawn in U.S. dollars in 2008 for a total amount of $380 million, of which $217 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2012. The third, signed in 2010 as a 350 million multi-currency loan to support our R&D programs in Europe, was drawn mainly in U.S. dollars and only partially in Euros for a total amount of $453 million. Additionally, we had unutilized committed medium-term credit facilities with core relationship banks of $490 million. At December 31, 2012, the amounts available under the uncommitted cash credit facilities were completely undrawn. Together with Ericsson, we have a committed facility to ST-Ericsson SA, which was extended at various times and in December 2012 reached the level of $1.5 billion. In December, the two parents decided to forgive the entire facility. The parents have agreed to extend funding for the first quarter 2013 only, with an expected total amount of approximately $260 million of which about $130 million would be provided by each partner. Our long-term capital market financing instruments contain standard covenants, but do not impose minimum financial ratios or similar obligations on us. Upon a change of control, the holders of our 2013 Senior Bonds may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holders bonds. As of December 31, 2012, debt payments due by year were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter (In millions) Long-term debt (including current portion) $ 1,301 $ 630 (1) $ 165 $ 144 $ 134 $ 58 $ 170 (1) Of which $462 million relates to our 2013 Senior Bonds which reach maturity in March 2013 and $160 million relate to EIB Loans. 76 Table of Contents In February 2006, we issued $1,131 million principal amount at maturity zero coupon senior convertible bonds due in February 2016. The bonds were convertible by the holder at any time prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 43.833898 shares per one thousand dollar face value of the bonds corresponding to 42,694,216 equivalent shares. In order to optimize our liability management and yield, we repurchased a portion of our 2016 Convertible Bonds during 2009 (98,000 bonds for a total cash consideration of $103 million and corresponding to 4,295,722 shares) and in 2010 (385,830 bonds for a total cash consideration of $410 million and corresponding to 16,912,433 shares). On February 23, 2011, certain holders redeemed 41,123 convertible bonds at a price of $1,077.58, out of the total of 490,170 outstanding bonds, or about 8%. In the third and fourth quarters of 2011, we repurchased 248,645 bonds for a total cash consideration of $270 million, corresponding to 10,899,080 shares. On February 23, 2012, certain holders redeemed 190,131 convertible bonds at a price of $1,093.81, out of the total of 200,402 outstanding bonds, representing approximately 95% of the then outstanding convertible bonds. In addition, on March 12, 2012, we accepted the further put of 4,980 bonds for a cash consideration of $5 million. On March 28, 2012, we published a notice of sweep up redemption for the remaining 5,291 bonds outstanding, which were redeemed on May 10, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, there were no bonds remaining outstanding. In March 2006, STMicroelectronics Finance B.V. (ST BV), a wholly owned subsidiary, issued floating rate senior bonds with a principal amount of 500 million at an issue price of 99.873% (2013 Senior Bonds). The notes, which mature on March 17, 2013, pay a coupon rate of the three-month Euribor plus 0.40% on June 17, September 17, December 17 and March 17 of each year through maturity. The notes have a put for early repayment in case of a change of control. The 2013 Senior Bonds issued by ST BV are guaranteed by ST NV. We repurchased a portion of our 2013 Senior Bonds: (i) for the amount of $98 million in 2010, and (ii) $107 million in 2011. As of December 31, 2012, we had the following credit ratings on our 2013 Senior Bonds: Moodys InvestorsService Standard &Poors Floating Rate Senior Bonds due 2013 Baa2 BBB On December 13, 2012, Moodys lowered our senior debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2 with stable outlook. On December 18, 2012, S&Ps lowered our senior debt rating from BBB+ to BBB with negative outlook. We are also rated BBB from Fitch on an unsolicited basis. On May 29, 2012, Fitch lowered our senior debt rating from BBB+ to BBB with negative outlook. Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Contingencies Our contractual obligations, commercial commitments and contingencies as of December 31, 2012, and for each of the five years to come and thereafter, were as follows:(1) Total 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Operating leases(2) $ 277 $ 71 $ 46 $ 36 $ 27 $ 24 $ 73 Purchase obligations(2) 521 414 67 40    of which: Equipment and other asset purchases 175 175      Foundry purchases 127 127      Software, technology licenses and design 219 112 67 40    Other obligations(2) 344 122 72 52 42 37 19 Long-term debt obligations (including current portion)(3)(4)(5) 1,301 630 165 144 134 58 170 of which: Capital leases(3) 5 3 2 Pension obligations(3) 484 16 32 25 30 36 345 Other long-term liabilities(3) 353 4 228 23 15 11 72 Total $ 3,280 $ 1,257 $ 610 $ 320 $ 248 $ 166 $ 679 (1) Contingent liabilities which cannot be quantified are excluded from the table above.

(4) See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2012 for additional information related to long-term debt and redeemable convertible securities. (5) Year of payment is based on maturity before taking into account any potential acceleration that could result from a triggering of the change of control provisions of the 2013 Senior Bonds. 77 Table of Contents As a result of our planned closures of certain manufacturing facilities, some of the aforementioned contracts have been terminated. The termination fees for the sites still in operation have not been taken into account. Operating leases are mainly related to building leases and to equipment. The amount disclosed is composed of minimum payments for future leases from 2013 to 2017 and thereafter. We lease land, buildings, plants and equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates under non-cancelable lease agreements. Purchase obligations are primarily comprised of purchase commitments for equipment, for outsourced foundry wafers and for software licenses. Other obligations primarily relate to firm contractual commitments with respect to partnership and cooperation agreements. Long-term debt obligations mainly consist of bank loans and non-convertible debt issued by us that is totally redeemable for cash. Our 2013 Senior Bonds, amounting to $462 million as of December 31, 2012, will mature on March 17, 2013 and we expect to redeem the whole amount with available cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, in 2013, we expect to redeem with available cash and cash equivalents a $160 million loan received from European Investment Bank as an annual installment. See  Net financial position (non U.S. GAAP measure) above. Pension obligations amounting to $484 million consist of our best estimates of the amounts projected to be payable by us for the retirement plans based on the assumption that our employees will work for us until they reach the age of retirement. The final actual amount to be paid and related timing of such payments may vary significantly due to early retirements, terminations and changes in assumptions rates. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of the Flash divestiture, we retained the obligation to fund the severance payment (trattamento di fine rapporto) due to certain transferred employees by the defined amount of about $26 million which qualifies as a defined benefit plan and was classified as an other long-term liability at December 31, 2012. Other long-term liabilities include, in addition to the above-mentioned pension obligations, future obligations related to our restructuring plans and miscellaneous contractual obligations. They also include at December 31, 2012, following the Flash divestiture in 2008, a long-term liability for capacity rights amounting to $13 million. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, as of December 31, 2012, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $227 million. We do not expect to recognize any of these tax benefits in 2013. We are not, however, able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of when these benefits will be recognized. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2012. Financial Outlook Our policy is to modulate our capital spending according to the evolution of the semiconductor market. Based on current visibility on demand, we anticipate our capex to remain at a low level in the first half 2013 and to be adjusted based on demand thereafter. We estimate a capital expenditure in the range of $500-600 million in 2013. The most significant of our 2013 capital expenditure projects are expected to be: (a) for our front-end facilities: (i) in our 300mm fab in Crolles, technology evolution to consolidate the capability for 20-nm processes and mix evolution to support the production ramp up of the most advanced technologies, preparing the future growth; (ii) a few selective programs of mix evolution, mainly in the area of analog processes; and (iii) quality, safety, maintenance, and productivity and cost savings investments in both 150mm and 200mm front-end fabs; (b) for our back-end facilities, capital expenditures will mainly be dedicated to: (i) capacity growth on strategic package families, mainly in the area of microsystems, to sustain market demand; (ii) repatriation of product lines from subcontractors and modernization of package lines targeting cost savings benefits; and (iii) specific investments in the areas of factory automation, quality, environment and energy savings; and (c) an overall capacity adjustment in final testing and wafers probing (EWS) according to change in demand. We will continue to monitor our level of capital spending by taking into consideration factors such as trends in the semiconductor industry and capacity utilization. We expect to need significant financial resources in the coming years for capital expenditures and for our investments in manufacturing and R&D. We plan to fund our capital requirements from cash provided by operating activities, available funds and support from third parties, and may have recourse to borrowings under available credit lines and, to the extent necessary or attractive based 78 Table of Contents on market conditions prevailing at the time, the issuance of debt, convertible bonds or additional equity securities. A substantial deterioration of our economic results, and consequently of our profitability, could generate a deterioration of the cash generated by our operating activities. Therefore, there can be no assurance that, in future periods, we will generate the same level of cash as in prior years to fund our capital expenditure plans for expanding/upgrading our production facilities, our working capital requirements, our R&D and manufacturing costs. Furthermore, there may be a need to provide additional financing by the parent companies to ST-Ericsson joint venture, depending upon which strategic option is pursued as part of our exit from the joint venture. Our current best estimate is that we could have funding requirements including the ongoing operations of ST-Ericsson during the transition period and restructuring costs in the range of approximately $300 million to $500 million during 2013. We are committed to participate in further capital increases of up to 14 million in 3Sun should certain events materialize. In addition to that, in case of a negative evolution of the business, there may be a need to provide additional resources to 3Sun. We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our currently projected business requirements for the next twelve months, including capital expenditures for our manufacturing activities, working capital requirements, approved dividend payments and the repayment of our debts in line with their maturity dates.
