RISK FACTORS Fifth Thirds results depend on general economic conditions within its operating markets. Fifth Third is affected by general economic conditions in the United States as a whole and, in particular, the Midwest and Florida. An economic downturn within these markets or the nation as a whole could negatively impact household and corporate incomes. This impact may lead to decreased demand for both loan and deposit products and increase the number of customers who fail to pay interest or principal on their loans. The revenues of FTPS are dependent on the transaction volume generated by its merchant and financial institution customers. This transaction volume is largely dependent on consumer and corporate spending. If consumer confidence suffers and retail sales decline, FTPS will be negatively impacted. Similarly, if an economic downturn results in a decrease in the overall volume of corporate transactions, FTPS will be negatively impacted. FTPS is also impacted by the financial stability of its merchant customers. FTPS assumes certain contingent liabilities related to the processing of Visa® and MasterCard® merchant card transactions. These liabilities typically arise from billing disputes between the merchant and the cardholder that are ultimately resolved in favor of the cardholder. These transactions are charged back to the merchant and disputed amounts are returned to the cardholder. If FTPS is unable to collect these amounts from the merchant, FTPS will bear the loss. The fee revenue of Investment Advisors is largely dependent on the fair market value of assets under care and trading volumes in the brokerage business. General economic conditions and their subsequent effect on the securities markets tend to act in correlation. When general economic conditions deteriorate, consumer and corporate confidence in securities markets erodes, and Investment Advisors revenues are negatively impacted as asset values and trading volumes decrease. Neutral economic conditions can also negatively impact revenue when stagnant securities markets fail to attract investors. Changes in interest rates could affect Fifth Thirds income and cash flows. Fifth Thirds income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and investment securities, and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond 22 Fifth Third Bancorp MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fifth Thirds control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies (in particular, the FRB). Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the prepayment speed of loans, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding. The impact of these changes may be magnified if Fifth Third does not effectively manage the relative sensitivity of its assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates. Fluctuations in these areas may adversely affect Fifth Third and its shareholders. If Fifth Third does not adjust to rapid changes in the financial services industry, its financial performance may suffer. Fifth Thirds ability to deliver strong financial performance and returns on investment to shareholders will depend in part on its ability to expand the scope of available financial services to meet the needs and demands of its customers. In addition to the challenge of competing against other banks in attracting and retaining customers for traditional banking services, Fifth Thirds competitors also include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, specialty finance and insurance companies who seek to offer one-stop financial services that may include services that banks have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past or may not be currently able or allowed to offer. This increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, as well as the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. Legislative or regulatory compliance, changes or actions or significant litigation, could adversely impact Fifth Third or the businesses in which Fifth Third is engaged. Fifth Third is subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations and limit the businesses in which Fifth Third may engage. These laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors and the deposit insurance funds. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact Fifth Third or its ability to increase the value of its business. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against Fifth Third could cause it to devote significant time and resources to defending itself and may lead to penalties that materially affect Fifth Third and its shareholders. Future changes in the laws, including tax laws, or regulations or their interpretations or enforcement may also be materially adverse to Fifth Third and its shareholders or may require Fifth Third to expend significant time and resources to comply with such requirements. Fifth Third is exposed to operational risk. Fifth Third is exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees, customers or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors. Negative public opinion can result from Fifth Thirds actual or alleged conduct in activities, such as lending practices, data security, corporate governance and acquisitions, and may damage Fifth Thirds reputation. Additionally, actions taken by government regulators and community organizations may also damage Fifth Thirds reputation. This negative public opinion can adversely affect Fifth Thirds ability to attract and keep customers and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action. Fifth Thirds necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process its transaction volume poses the risk that technical system flaws or employee errors, tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses and may be difficult to detect. Fifth Third may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are beyond its control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages). Fifth Third is further exposed to the risk that its outside service providers may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors as Fifth Third). These disruptions may interfere with service to Fifth Thirds customers and result in a financial loss or liability. Material breaches in security of Fifth Thirds systems may have a significant effect on Fifth Thirds business. Fifth Third collects, processes and stores sensitive consumer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both Fifth Third and third party service providers. Fifth Third has security, backup and recovery systems in place, as well as a business continuity plan to ensure the system will not be inoperable. Fifth Third also has security to prevent unauthorized access to the system. In addition, Fifth Third requires its third party service providers to maintain similar controls. However, Fifth Third cannot be certain that the measures will be successful. A security breach in the system and loss of confidential information such as credit card numbers and related information could result in losing the customers confidence and thus the loss of their business. Changes and trends in the capital markets may affect Fifth Thirds income and cash flows. Fifth Third enters into and maintains trading and investment positions in the capital markets on its own behalf and on behalf of its customers. These investment positions also include derivative financial instruments. The revenues and profits Fifth Third derives from its trading and investment positions are dependent on market prices. If it does not correctly anticipate market changes and trends, Fifth Third may experience investment or trading losses that may materially affect Fifth Third and its shareholders. Losses on behalf of its customers could expose Fifth Third to litigation, credit risks or loss of revenue from those customers. Additionally, substantial losses in Fifth Thirds trading and investment positions could lead to a loss with respect to those investments and may adversely affect cash flows and funding costs. Changes in accounting standards could impact reported earnings. The accounting standard setters, including the FASB, SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Fifth Thirds consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how Fifth Third records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some changes, Fifth Third could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restatement of Fifth Thirds prior period financial statements. The preparation of Fifth Thirds financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Two of Fifth Thirds most critical estimates are the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, Fifth Third cannot provide absolute assurance that it will not significantly increase the allowance for loan and lease losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, nor that it will not Fifth Third Bancorp 23 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS recognize a significant provision for impairment of its mortgage servicing rights. For more information on the sensitivity of these estimates, please refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section. Fifth Third could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel. As Fifth Third continues to grow, its success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals. Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that Fifth Third serves is great and Fifth Third may not be able to hire these candidates and retain them. If Fifth Third is not able to hire or retain these key individuals, Fifth Third may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations and financial condition. Fifth Third and/or the holders of its securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable ratings from rating agencies. Fifth Thirds ability to access the capital markets is important to its overall funding profile. This access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to Fifth Third, certain of its affiliates and particular classes of securities they issue. The interest rates that Fifth Third pays on its securities are also influenced by, among other things, the credit ratings that it, its affiliates and/or its securities receive from recognized rating agencies. A downgrade to Fifth Thirds, or its affiliates, credit rating will affect its ability to access the capital markets, increase its borrowing costs and negatively impact its profitability. A ratings downgrade to Fifth Third, its affiliates or their securities could also create obligations or liabilities to Fifth Third under the terms of its outstanding securities that could increase Fifth Thirds costs or otherwise have a negative effect on Fifth Thirds results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by Fifth Third or its affiliates could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold. Fifth Thirds stock price is volatile. Fifth Thirds stock price has been volatile in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include:  Actual or anticipated variations in earnings;  Changes in analysts recommendations or projections;  Fifth Thirds announcements of developments related to its businesses;  Operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;  Actions by government regulators;  New technology used or services offered by traditional and non-traditional competitors; and  News reports of trends, concerns and other issues related to the financial services industry. Fifth Thirds stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to Fifth Thirds performance. General market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of its common stock, and the current market price of such stock may not be indicative of future market prices. Fifth Thirds ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries accounts for most of its revenue and could affect its liquidity and ability to pay dividends. Fifth Third Bancorp is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. Fifth Third Bancorp receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on Fifth Third Bancorps stock and interest and principal on its debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that Fifth Thirds bank and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay. Also, Fifth Third Bancorps right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiarys creditors. Limitations on Fifth Third Bancorps ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on Fifth Third Bancorps liquidity and ability to pay dividends on stock or interest and principal on its debt. Future acquisitions may dilute current shareholders ownership of Fifth Third and may cause Fifth Third to become more susceptible to adverse economic events. Future business acquisitions could be material to Fifth Third and it may issue additional shares of common stock to pay for those acquisitions, which would dilute current shareholders ownership interest. Acquisitions also could require Fifth Third to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt. In those events, it could become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures. Difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with Fifth Thirds own operations may prevent Fifth Third from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions. Inherent uncertainties exist in integrating the operations of an acquired entity. Fifth Third may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and operating efficiencies in an acquisition. In addition, the markets and industries in which Fifth Third and its potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. Fifth Third may lose customers or the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition. Future acquisition and integration activities may require Fifth Third to devote substantial time and resources and as a result Fifth Third may not be able to pursue other business opportunities. These factors could contribute to Fifth Third not achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions within desired time frames, if at all. 24 Fifth Third Bancorp MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS Net Interest Income Net interest income is the interest earned on debt securities, loans and leases (including yield-related fees) and other interest-earning assets less the interest paid for core deposits and wholesale funding. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by non-interest bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders equity. The continued increases in short-term rates during the first half of 2006 and the subsequent inverted interest rate yield curve negatively impacted Fifth Third as well as other financial institutions in 2006. The average interest rate spread between the 3-month Treasury bill and the 10-year Treasury note compressed from 107 bp in 2005 to negative 6 bp in 2006. At December 31, 2006, this interest rate spread declined to negative 31 bp. This significant decline illustrates the relative pressure between shorter-term and longer-term funding costs and general securities portfolio reinvestment opportunities. Net interest income declined three percent to $2.9 billion as a result of the net interest margin contracting 17 bp to 3.06%. The decline in the net interest margin occurred despite an increase in average loans and leases of eight percent and an increase in average core deposits of five percent. In terms of mix between volume and yield, net interest income decreased eight percent due to the impact of changes in interest rates. The decline in net interest margin largely resulted from the decrease in net interest spread, from 2.76% in 2005 to 2.37% in 2006, attributable to the increased cost of deposits and wholesale funding, the impact of the primarily fixed-rate securities portfolio and the change in mix within the core deposit base. The decrease in net interest spread was partially offset by an increased benefit from free funding of 69 bp in 2006, up 22 bp over 2005. The relatively large increase in the benefit of free funding was the result of higher funding costs and an improvement in the net free funding position of the Bancorp, calculated as total noninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders equity less noninterest-earning assets, which increased two percent to $16.7 billion. In light of the Bancorps asset/liability considerations and changing market conditions, the Bancorps Board of Directors approved several actions on November 20, 2006 to strategically shift the composition of its balance sheet. These actions reduced the size of the Bancorps available-for-sale securities portfolio to a size that is more consistent with its liquidity, collateral and interest rate risk management requirements; improved the composition of the balance sheet with a lower concentration of fixed-rate assets; lowered wholesale borrowings to reduce leverage; and better positioned the Bancorp for an uncertain economic and interest rate environment. Specifically, these actions included (i) the sale of $11.3 billion in available-for-sale securities with a weighted-average yield of 4.30%; (ii) reinvestment of approximately $2.8 billion in available-for-sale securities that are more efficient when used as collateral; (iii) repayment of $8.5 billion in wholesale borrowings at an average rate paid of 5.30%; and (iv) the termination of approximately $1.1 billion of repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. These actions are expected to result in a benefit to net interest income in 2007, given current market expectations, of approximately $110 million to $120 million, and a benefit to the net interest margin in 2007 of approximately 35-40 bp. The growth in average loans and leases in 2006 outpaced core deposit growth by $2.7 billion. The funding shortfall was more than offset by a $4.0 billion reduction in the average available-for-sale securities portfolio. In addition to the fourth quarter sale of available-for-sale securities mentioned above, throughout 2006, the Bancorp continued to use cash flows from its securities portfolio to reduce its reliance on wholesale funding. In the third quarter of 2006, the Bancorp also sold approximately $726 million from its securities portfolio, which represented nearly all of its position in Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) callable debt, in order to manage its credit exposure to FHLMC. In 2006, wholesale funding represented 41% of interest-bearing liabilities, down from 44% in 2005. During 2006, the Bancorp continued its deposit pricing strategy of moving away from promotional rates and towards highly competitive daily rates. As part of this strategy, the Bancorp maintains competitive deposit rates in all of its affiliate markets and across all of its deposit products. Additionally, interest-checking balances have continued to migrate into money market, savings and time deposit accounts. During 2006, interest-checking balances were 36% of average interest-bearing core deposits and savings and money market combined to represent 41%, compared to 44% and 36%, respectively, in 2005.

The cost of interest-bearing core deposits was 3.18% in 2006, up from 2.10% in 2005. Despite the increasing deposit rates, the relative cost advantage of interest-bearing core deposits compared to wholesale funding increased from 126 bp in 2005 to 183 bp in 2006. Due to the increasing relative cost advantage of core deposits, the Bancorp has continued to expand its branching network to increase its presence in markets that offer the best growth prospects. In 2006, the Bancorp added 51 net new banking centers with plans to add a similar amount in 2007. Interest income (FTE) from loans and leases increased $1.1 billion, or 28%, compared to 2005. The increase resulted from the growth in average loans and leases of eight percent as well as a 102 bp increase in average rates. Average commercial loans and leases grew 10% in 2006 due to growth in all subcategories. The yield on commercial loans and leases expanded by 117 bp to 7.07% in 2006. The yield expansion was greatest in commercial loans and commercial construction due to the increase in short-term interest rates and the subsequent repricing. Average consumer loans and leases increased by six percent in 2006 driven primarily by the 23% increase in residential construction and nine percent increase in other consumer loans. Other consumer loans primarily consist of direct and indirect home equity lines and loans, direct and indirect auto loans and credit cards. The average consumer loan and lease yield increased 83 bp to 6.52%. Interest income (FTE) from investment securities and short-term investments decreased $126 million to $970 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to the previously mentioned reduction of the investment securities portfolio. The average yield on taxable securities increased by only 15 bp as a result of the relative stability in longer-term interest rates. The interest on core deposits increased $562 million, or 63%, in 2006 over 2005 due to increases in short-term interest rates and increasing average balances. Average interest-bearing core deposits increased $3.2 billion, or seven percent, compared to 2005. The Bancorp continues to focus on growing its core deposit balances in order to improve the funding mix and improve net interest margin trends. The growth in noninterest-bearing funds and other core deposits is a critical component in the growth of net interest income. The interest on wholesale funding increased by $490 million, or 43%, in 2006 compared to 2005 due to increasing short-term interest rates partially offset by a $1.4 billion, or four percent, decrease in average balances. Throughout 2006, the Bancorp used the proceeds from the securities portfolio to lessen its reliance on 26 Fifth Third Bancorp MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS wholesale funding in order to reduce leverage and better position the Bancorp for the uncertain rate environment. Table 4 presents the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest spread for 2006, 2005 and 2004. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities included in other assets. Table 5 provides the relative impact of changes in the balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income.

Provision for Loan and Lease Losses The Bancorp provides as an expense an amount for probable loan and lease losses within the loan portfolio that is based on factors discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section. The provision is recorded to bring the allowance for loan and lease losses to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. The amount of loans actually removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets is referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries in the current period on previously charged off assets. The provision for loan and lease losses increased to $343 million in 2006 compared to $330 million in 2005. The $13 million increase from the prior year is due to both the increase in nonperforming assets from $361 million in 2005 to $455 million in 2006 and increased loan growth throughout the year. As of December 31, 2006, the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percent of loans and leases declined modestly to 1.04% from 1.06% at December 31, 2005. Refer to the Credit Risk Management section for further information on the provision for loan and lease losses, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the allowance for loan and lease losses. Noninterest Income In 2006, the Bancorp refined its presentation of noninterest income in order to provide more granularity around its revenue streams. The primary result of this refinement was the consolidation of the Bancorps interest rate derivative sales, international service fees, institutional sales and loan and lease syndication fees into a new income statement line item titled corporate banking revenue. Total noninterest income decreased 14% compared to 2005 primarily due to the impact of the previously mentioned balance sheet actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2006. Excluding the $415 million impact of these actions, noninterest income increased $68 million, or three percent, over 2005. The components of noninterest income are shown in Table 6. Electronic payment processing revenue increased $109 million, or 15%, in 2006 as FTPS realized growth in each of its three product lines. Merchant processing revenue increased $45 million, or 13%, to $395 million due to the addition of new national merchant customers and resulting increases in merchant transaction volumes. EFT revenue increased $41 million, or 16%, to $297 million as a result of continued success in attracting financial institution customers. Card issuer interchange increased $23 million, or 16%, to $165 million on sales volume increases of 15%. The Bancorp continues to see significant opportunities in attracting new financial institution customers and retailers. The Bancorp handles electronic processing for over 142,000 merchant locations and 2,300 financial institutions worldwide, including The Kroger Co., Nordstrom, Inc., the Armed Forces Financial Network and, during 2006, added Talbots and Gregg Appliances, Inc.

Commercial deposit revenues were comparable to the prior year as the overall growth in commercial account relationships was offset by a 34% increase in earnings credits on compensating balances as a result of the higher interest rate environment. Retail deposit revenues were flat in 2006 compared to 2005. Net new consumer deposit account production increased by 40% during 2006 compared to 2005. However, the production increase was offset by lower consumer overdraft fees. Growth in the number of customer deposit account relationships and deposit generation continues to be a primary focus of the Bancorp. Mortgage banking net revenue decreased to $155 million in 2006 from $174 million in 2005. The components of mortgage banking net revenue are shown in Table 7. Origination fees and gains on loans sales decreased $36 million due to lower origination volume, the increasingly competitive nature of the business and the effects of the inverted yield curve. Originations in 2006 were $9.4 billion compared to $9.9 billion in 2005. Mortgage net servicing revenue increased by $17 million compared to 2005. Net servicing revenue is comprised of gross servicing fees and related amortization as well as valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights and mark-to-market adjustments on both settled and outstanding free-standing derivative financial instruments. The Bancorps total residential mortgage loans serviced at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $37.9 billion and $34.0 billion, respectively, with $28.7 billion and $25.7 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others. The increase in interest rates and the resulting decrease in changing prepayment speeds led to a recovery in temporary impairment of $19 million in 2006 and $33 million in 2005. Servicing rights are deemed temporarily impaired when a borrowers loan rate is distinctly higher than prevailing rates. Temporary impairment on servicing rights is reversed when the prevailing rates return to a level commensurate with the borrowers loan rate. Further detail on the valuation of mortgage servicing rights can be found in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with the impact of changes in interest rates on the MSR portfolio. The Bancorp recognized a net loss of $9 million and $23 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to changes in fair value and settlement of free-standing derivatives purchased to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to hedge the MSR portfolio. In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp began to acquire various securities (primarily principal-only strips) during 2005 as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. A gain of $3 million was recognized in 2006 on the sale of securities used to hedge the MSR portfolio. Investment advisory revenues were up modestly in 2006 compared to 2005. Private client revenues increased $10 million, or eight percent due to growth in nearly all subcategories on the strength of cross-sell initiatives within the private client group. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in mutual fund fees of $7 million, or 10%, reflecting the effects of a shift toward a greater open architecture framework where investors are provided with other mutual fund options in addition to the family of Fifth Third Funds.* The Bancorp continues to focus its sales efforts on improving execution in retail brokerage and retail mutual funds and on growing the institutional money management business by improving penetration and cross-sell in its large middle-market commercial customer base. The Bancorp is one of the largest money managers in the Midwest and as of December 31, 2006 had approximately $220 billion in assets under care, $34 billion in assets under management and $12 billion in its proprietary Fifth Third Funds.* Compared to 2005, corporate banking revenue increased $19 million primarily due to a $13 million, or 13%, increase in commercial syndication fees. Other increases included a $4 million, or five percent, increase in derivative product revenues and $2 million, or six percent, increase in underwriting revenues. The Bancorp is committed to providing a comprehensive range of financial services to large and middle-market businesses and continues to see opportunities to expand its product offering. The major components of other noninterest income for each of the last five years are shown in Table 8. Other noninterest income declined 17% compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily attributable to the continued planned run off in the consumer operating lease portfolio and a $17 million loss in mark-to-market free-standing derivatives related to the balance sheet actions taken in the fourth quarter.

Operating lease revenues will moderate throughout 2007 as automobile leases continue to mature and are offset by originations of commercial operating leases. The Bancorp recognized net securities losses of $364 million in 2006. Securities losses in 2006 primarily consisted of losses resulting from balance sheet actions taken during the fourth quarter of 2006 partially offset by a $78 million gain from the sale of MasterCard, Inc. shares.

Cost savings initiatives will continue to be somewhat mitigated by investments in certain high opportunity markets, as evidenced by the de novo banking centers added in 2006. During 2006, the Bancorp continued its investment in the expansion of the retail distribution network and in its information technology infrastructure. The efficiency ratio (noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income (FTE) and noninterest income) was 60.5% and 53.2% for 2006 and 2005, respectively, and was affected by the balance sheet actions during the fourth quarter of 2006. Excluding fourth quarter balance sheet actions, the efficiency ratio for 2006 was 55.2%; comparison being provided to supplement an understanding of fundamental trends. Total noninterest expense increased four percent in 2006 compared to 2005. This comparison is impacted by $49 million of debt and other financing agreement termination charges. Exclusive of these charges, total noninterest expense increased by $80 million, or three percent, over 2005 primarily due to increases in volume-related bankcard costs and occupancy expenditures related to the addition of de novo banking centers. Total personnel cost (salaries, wages and incentives plus employee benefits) increased by four percent in 2006 compared to 2005. The increases are related to employee incentives, increased medical insurance costs and a change in accounting for retirement eligible stock compensation as a result of the implementation of SFAS 123(R). See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding stock-based compensation. As of December 31, 2006, the Bancorp employed 22,385 employees, of which 6,140 were officers and 2,715 were part-time employees. Full time equivalent employees totaled 21,362 as of December 31, 2006 compared to 21,681 as of December 31, 2005. Net occupancy expenses increased 11% in 2006 over 2005 due to the addition of 51 net new banking centers. The Bancorp remains focused on expanding its retail franchise through de novo growth with plans to open approximately 50 net new banking centers in 2007. Total other noninterest expense increased three percent in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to volume-related bankcard costs and previously mentioned debt and other financing agreement termination charges. Exclusive of these termination charges, other noninterest income decreased $11 million, or one percent. Marketing expense was stable compared to the prior year and remains primarily focused on deposit generation. Bankcard expense increased 16% compared to last year due to an increase in the number of merchant and retail customers as well as continuing growth in debit and credit card usage. Operating lease expense declined 55% from 2005 as a result of the continued planned run off of the automobile operating lease portfolio as noted above.

Applicable income tax expense for all periods includes the benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments and general business tax credits, partially offset by the effect of nondeductible expenses. In 2006, the lower pretax income combined with tax credits at a level consistent with the prior years and favorable resolution of certain tax examinations resulted in a decrease in the effective tax rate. In 2007, the Bancorp expects the effective tax rate to be approximately 29%-30%. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In the first quarter of 2006, the Bancorp recognized a benefit of approximately $4 million, net of $2 million of tax, related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The benefit recognized relates to the Bancorps estimate of forfeiture experience to be realized for all unvested stock-based awards outstanding. Comparison of 2005 with 2004 Net income in 2005 increased $24 million compared to 2004. Diluted earnings per common share were $2.77 compared to $2.68. In 2005, return on average assets was 1.50% and return on average shareholders equity was 16.6% versus 1.61% and 17.2%, respectively, in 2004. Net income in 2004 was negatively impacted by balance sheet actions, which included debt termination charges and securities losses totaling $404 million pretax. Earnings were positively impacted by a $157 million pretax gain resulting from the sale of certain third- party sourced merchant processing contracts in 2004 and securities gains totaling $39 million pretax in 2005. Net interest income (FTE) decreased $52 million in 2005 compared to 2004. The net interest margin decline to 3.23% in 2005 from 3.48% in 2004 was primarily attributable to the rise in short-term interest rates, the impact of the primarily fixed-rate securities portfolio and mix shifts within the core deposit base. The decline in net interest margin occurred despite a six percent increase in average interest-earning assets from 2004 to 2005. Noninterest income increased $35 million in 2005 compared to 2004. The comparison to 2004 is impacted by the gain on sale of certain third-party sourced merchant processing contracts in 2004. Exclusive of this gain, noninterest income increased eight percent compared to 2005. The increase in noninterest income was attributable to increased electronic payment processing revenue and corporate banking revenue offset by a decrease in operating lease revenue as a result of the run off of the automobile operating lease portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $45 million in 2005 compared to 2004. Increases in salaries, wages and incentives were offset by the previously discussed debt termination charges in 2004 totaling $325 million. The increased salaries, wages and incentives were a result of the sales force expansion and the addition of employees from the acquisition of First National Bankshares of Florida, Inc. on January 1, 2005. The provision for loan and lease losses was $330 million in 2005 compared to $268 million in 2004. The increase in the provision was due to the increase in nonperforming assets as well as a 17% portfolio loan growth. The total allowance for loan and lease losses as a percent of total loans and leases was 1.06% at December 31, 2005 compared to 1.19% at December 31, 2004. 30 Fifth Third Bancorp MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW The Bancorp reports on five business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending, Investment Advisors and Processing Solutions. During the first quarter of 2006, the Bancorp began reporting its Retail line of business as two business segments, Branch Banking and Consumer Lending. All prior year information has been updated to reflect this presentation. Further detailed financial information on each business segment is included in Note 28 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorps business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorps business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management accounting practices are improved and businesses change. Revisions to the Bancorps methodologies are applied on a retroactive basis. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Bancorp changed its application of the provision for loan and lease losses to the segments to include only actual net charge-offs. The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level by employing a funds transfer pricing (FTP) methodology. This methodology insulates the business segments from interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on servicing customers through loan originations and deposit taking. The FTP system assigns charge rates and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on expected duration and the Treasury swap curve. Matching the duration, or the effective term until an instrument can be repriced, allocates interest income and interest expense to each segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from interest rate risk. In a rising rate environment, the Bancorp benefits from widening spread between deposit costs and wholesale funding costs. However, the Bancorps FTP system credits this benefit to deposit providing businesses, such as Branch Banking and Investment Advisors, on a duration-adjusted basis. The net impact of the FTP methodology, including the benefit from the widening spread between deposit costs and wholesale funding, is captured in Other/Eliminations. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Bancorp made certain changes to the average duration of indeterminate-lived deposits and corresponding changes to the FTP crediting rates assigned to those deposits. This change more closely aligns the crediting rates to the expected economic benefit while continuing to insulate the segments from interest rate volatility. Prior period results have been conformed to current period presentation. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarter expenses. Even with these allocations, the financial results are not necessarily indicative of the business segments financial condition and results of operations as if they were to exist as independent entities. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of cross-sell opportunities and when funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit. Net income by business segment is summarized in the table below.

Net income increased $37 million, or six percent, compared to 2005 largely as a result of loan and deposit growth and success in the sale of corporate banking services. Average loans and leases increased 11% over 2005, to $33.6 billion, with growth occurring across all loan categories. The moderate decrease in average demand deposits from the prior year primarily due to lower relative compensating balance requirements was more than offset by increases in interest checking and savings and money market deposits. Average core deposits increased to $15.2 billion in 2006 from $14.4 billion in 2005. The increase in average core deposits and loans and leases and the related net FTP impact led to a $64 million increase in net interest income compared to the prior year. The provision for loan and lease losses, which now equals net charge-offs, increased $8 million over 2005. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans remained flat at 31 bp in 2006 compared to 32 bp in 2005 and 30 bp in 2004. Noninterest income increased $21 million, or four percent, compared to 2005 largely due to an increase in corporate banking revenue of $17 million, or six percent. Increases in corporate banking revenue occurred in nearly all sub captions. Other noninterest income fee lines displayed mixed results compared to the prior year, as operating lease income grew from $8 million to $18 million, while service charges on deposits decreased four percent due largely to increased earnings credits. Noninterest expense increased $44 million, or six percent, in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to volume-related increases in loan, bankcard, operating lease and data processing expenses. Fifth Third Bancorp 31 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Branch Banking Branch Banking provides a full range of deposit and loan and lease products to individuals and small businesses through 1,150 banking centers. Branch Banking offers depository and loan products, such as checking and savings accounts, home equity lines of credit, credit cards and loans for automobile and other personal financing needs, as well as products designed to meet the specific needs of small businesses, including cash management services. The table below contains selected financial data for the Branch Banking segment.

Net interest income increased $39 million as increases in average loans and leases and total deposits were partially offset by a deposit mix shift toward higher paying deposit account types. Average loans and leases increased seven percent to $15.7 billion, led by growth in credit cards of 21% and small business loans of eight percent. Branch Banking continued to realize a shift to higher-rate deposit products throughout 2006. Interest checking and demand deposits decreased $2.9 billion, or 15%, and savings, money market and other time deposits increased $4.9 billion, or 27%, compared to 2005. The provision for loan and lease losses increased $10 million over 2005. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans and leases increased slightly from 62 bp to 64 bp. Noninterest income increased seven percent from 2005. Electronic payment processing revenue increased due to a $27 million, or 20%, increase in card issuer interchange and a $7 million, or 26%, increase in cardholder fees. The Bancorp expects interchange and cardholder fees to continue to grow due to the increased emphasis on cross-selling credit cards to its existing customer base. Noninterest expense increased by four percent compared to 2005 as costs were contained despite the effect from the Bancorps continued de novo banking center growth strategy. Net occupancy and equipment expenses increased 11% compared to 2005 as a result of the continued opening of new banking centers. 51 banking centers were opened in 2006, and 63 in 2005, that did not involve the relocation or consolidation of existing facilities. The Bancorp will continue to position itself for sustained long-term growth through new banking center additions. Card processing expenses increased $15 million on greater sales volumes, and marketing expenses increased $8 million primarily related to attracting new core deposit accounts. Consumer Lending Consumer Lending includes the Bancorps mortgage and home equity lending activities and other indirect lending activities. Mortgage and home equity lending activities include the origination, retention and servicing of mortgage and home equity loans or lines of credit, sales and securitizations of those loans or pools of loans or lines of credit and all associated hedging activities. Other indirect lending activities include loans to consumers through mortgage brokers, auto dealers and federal and private student education loans. The table below contains selected financial data for the Consumer Lending segment. TABLE 15: CONSUMER LENDING For the years ended December 31 ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Income Statement Data Net interest income $380 397 421 Provision for loan and lease losses 94 90 84 Noninterest income: Mortgage banking net revenue 148 165 167 Other noninterest income 81 125 227 Noninterest expense: Salaries, incentives and benefits 101 98 102 Other noninterest expenses 202 252 309 Income before taxes 212 247 320 Applicable income taxes 75 87 109 Net income $137 160 211 Average Balance Sheet Data Consumer loans $20,430 19,161 17,536 Net income decreased $23 million, or 14%, compared to 2005. Net interest income decreased $17 million, or four percent, despite average loans and leases increasing seven percent, due to a 17 bp decline in the spread between loan yields and the related FTP charge as a result of the shift in the mix of loans and the increasingly competitive environment in which this segment competes. The Bancorp is focused on meeting its customers varying financial needs by offering new consumer products while maintaining its current credit quality profile. The Bancorp had mortgage originations of $9.4 billion, $9.9 and $8.4 billion in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As a result of the decrease in originations and the corresponding decrease in gains on sales of mortgages, mortgage banking net revenue decreased $17 million, or 10%. Decreases in other noninterest income and expense were largely a result of the planned run off of the consumer operating lease portfolios. Operating lease income and expense decreased from 2005 by $39 million and $29 million, respectively. As the operating lease portfolio is nearing maturity, operating lease income and expense should have an immaterial effect on 2007 results. 32 Fifth Third Bancorp MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Investment Advisors Investment Advisors provides a full range of investment alternatives for individuals, companies and not-for-profit organizations. The Bancorps primary services include investments, trust, asset management, retirement plans and custody. Fifth Third Securities, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bancorp, offers full service retail brokerage services to individual clients and broker dealer services to the institutional marketplace.

Net interest income declined four percent to $125 million due to the decline in interest rate spread as a result of the continued mix shift to higher cost deposit products. The negative impact of the shift in deposit mix more than offset the $384 million, or 14%, increase in average loans and leases in 2006. Noninterest income increased three percent from 2005 as the $7 million increase in private client revenues was mitigated by a decrease in mutual fund revenue of $3 million. The decrease in mutual fund revenue was primarily the result of the deployment of an open architecture on proprietary fund sales. Noninterest expenses decreased modestly compared to the prior year due to the focus on expense control. Employee compensation is expected to increase in 2007 as the Bancorp looks to expand its sales force throughout its footprint, particularly in retail brokerage. Processing Solutions Fifth Third Processing Solutions provides electronic funds transfer, debit, credit and merchant transaction processing, operates the Jeanie® ATM network and provides other data processing services to affiliated and unaffiliated customers. The table below contains selected financial data for the Processing Solutions segment. TABLE 17: PROCESSING SOLUTIONS For the years ended December 31 ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Income Statement Data Net interest income $33 28 29 Provision for loan and lease losses 10 18 10 Noninterest income: Merchant processing 397 351 305 EFT processing 297 257 219 Other noninterest income 88 25 173 Noninterest expense: Salaries, incentives and benefits 71 53 50 Net occupancy and equipment expenses 13 6 7 Transaction processing 303 253 205 Other noninterest expenses 140 150 145 Income before taxes 278 181 309 Applicable income taxes 98 64 105 Net income $180 117 204 Net income increased $63 million versus the prior year. Excluding the $78 million of pretax securities gains from the sale of the Bancorps MasterCard, Inc. shares, included in other noninterest income, net income increased 10% compared to 2005, as electronic payment processing revenues continued to produce double-digit increases. Merchant and EFT revenues increased by 13% and 15% primarily due to new customer additions and related increased volume. 2004 results are affected by the sale of certain third-party sourced merchant processing contracts that resulted in a pretax gain of $157 million. The Bancorp continues to see opportunities to attract new financial institution customers and retailers within this business segment. The strong increase in noninterest income was mitigated by a 14% increase in noninterest expense due to headcount additions, investment in information technology and transaction processing costs. Salaries, incentives and benefits increased 33% with the addition of over 300 employees. The 20% increase in transaction processing costs compared to 2005 primarily resulted from network membership fees and volume-related costs as the number of merchant transactions processed increased 17% over 2005. Other/Eliminations Other/Eliminations includes the unallocated portion of the investment securities portfolio, certain wholesale funding, unassigned equity and certain support activities, provision expense in excess of net charge-offs and other items not attributed to the business segments. The results of Other/Eliminations were primarily impacted by the balance sheet actions in the fourth quarter of 2006 and the related loss on the sale of securities. Other/Eliminations was also impacted by wholesale funding repricing at a faster rate than securities as a result of rising short-term rates in the first half of 2006. The Bancorp experienced an increase in the average interest rate on wholesale funding from 3.36% in 2005 to 5.02% in 2006 compared to an increase in the average interest rate on securities from 4.36% in 2005 to 4.56% in 2006. Fifth Third Bancorp 33 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOURTH QUARTER REVIEW The Bancorps 2006 fourth quarter earnings per diluted share were $.12 compared to $.60 per diluted share for the same period in 2005. Fourth quarter net income totaled $66 million compared to $332 million in the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter 2006 earnings and ratios were negatively impacted by $454 million in total pretax losses and charges related to balance sheet actions taken to improve the asset/liability profile of the Bancorp. The pretax losses and charges consisted of $398 million in losses on the sale of $11.3 billion in available-for-sale securities; $17 million in losses on derivatives related to the securities sold, recorded in other noninterest income; and $39 million in charges related to the termination of the repurchase and reverse agreements, recorded in other noninterest expense. Return on average assets and return on average equity were .25% and 2.6%, respectively, compared to 1.27% and 13.9% in 2005s fourth quarter. The Bancorps efficiency ratio was 82.9% in the fourth quarter compared to 55.6% last year and 55.5% in the previous quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2005, net interest income (FTE) increased one percent, reflecting a two percent decline in earning assets and 5 bp improvement of the net interest margin (FTE). Compared to the third quarter of 2006, net interest income (FTE) increased by $25 million and was primarily driven by the sale of available-for-sale securities and repayment of $8.5 billion in wholesale borrowings. Solid trends in loan growth and greater stability in deposit pricing also contributed to the increase. The improvement in net interest margin in the fourth quarter was primarily due to the sales of securities, stronger core deposit growth and improved loan yields. Overall noninterest income, excluding balance sheet actions taken in the fourth quarter, remained flat compared to the same quarter last year and increased three percent on a sequential basis. Electronic payment processing revenues increased 14% over the same quarter last year reflecting double-digit growth in merchant processing and card interchange, though growth was mitigated by the effects of slower consumer spending throughout 2006. Deposit service revenue decreased eight percent compared to the same quarter last year. Retail deposit revenue decreased 10% reflecting significantly lower consumer overdraft fees. The Bancorp has been encouraging its customers to enroll in overdraft protection as a means to establish stronger relationships and improve account retention. Commercial deposit revenue decreased five percent due to increased earnings credits on compensating balances. Mortgage banking net revenue totaled $30 million in the fourth quarter compared to $42 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The decline was primarily due to decreased origination fees and lower gains on loan sales, reflecting lower market spreads. Mortgage originations were $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter and $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter mortgage banking net servicing revenue totaled $7 million and was comprised of $31 million in total mortgage servicing fees, less $19 million in amortization and $5 million in net valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights. Investment advisory revenues increased by four percent over the same quarter last year. The increase was driven by strong growth in private banking and moderate growth in the retail securities and institutional businesses, partially offset by lower mutual fund fees reflecting the ongoing effect of open architecture on proprietary fund sales. Corporate banking revenue for the fourth quarter 2006 decreased 11% compared to the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to unusually strong fourth quarter 2005 lease syndication fees, as well as lower letter of credit and customer interest rate derivative income. Other noninterest income totaled $58 million in the fourth quarter compared to $77 million in the same quarter last year. The decrease from the prior year quarter was a result of the $17 million in losses on derivatives related to securities sold as part of the balance sheet actions taken in this years fourth quarter. Other noninterest income decreased by $29 million compared to the third quarter of 2006. Comparisons to the third quarter reflect the losses on derivatives mentioned above, in addition to $11 million in gains related to the third quarter sales of three Indiana branches and a small out-of-footprint credit card portfolio. Total noninterest expense increased by five percent compared to the same quarter last year. Comparisons reflect a $39 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2006 associated with the termination of financing agreements as part of the balance sheet actions taken and approximately $9 million in fraud-related expenses and approximately $10 million in tax-related expense in the fourth quarter 2005. Excluding the above-mentioned items, noninterest expense increased two percent due to higher personnel expense and de novo related occupancy expense. Compared to the third quarter of 2006, total noninterest expense increased by $31 million primarily due to higher processing volume-related expenses and the $39 million in termination of financing agreements mentioned above, offset by $11 million in charges for the early retirement of debt and $8 million in pension settlement expenses incurred in the third quarter. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases were 52 bp in the fourth quarter, compared to 43 bp last quarter and 67 bp in the fourth quarter of 2005. Net charge-offs were $97 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $79 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $117 million in the same quarter last year. The increase from the last quarter resulted from two large commercial credits totaling $9 million, higher small business charge-offs and higher indirect consumer losses. Fourth quarter 2005 numbers reflect an elevated level of net charge-offs associated with approximately $27 million in losses from bankrupt commercial airline carriers and a $15 million increase in consumer loan and lease losses associated with increased personal bankruptcies declared prior to enacted reform legislation in 2005. The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $107 million in the fourth quarter compared to $87 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $134 million in the same quarter last year. 34 Fifth Third Bancorp MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS TABLE 18: COMPONENTS OF TOTAL LOANS AND LEASES (INCLUDING HELD FOR SALE) As of December 31 ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Commercial: Commercial loans $ 20,725 19,299 16,058 14,226 12,786 Commercial mortgage 10,405 9,188 7,636 6,894 5,885 Commercial construction 6,168 6,342 4,348 3,301 3,009 Commercial leases 3,841 3,698 3,426 3,264 3,019 Total commercial loans and leases 41,139 38,527 31,468 27,685 24,699 Consumer: Residential mortgage 9,226 8,296 7,533 5,530 6,804 Residential construction 679 695 378 335 319 Credit card 1,110 866 843 762 537 Home equity 12,365 12,000 10,508 8,993 8,675 Other consumer loans 9,911 9,250 7,586 8,436 5,909 Consumer leases 1,073 1,595 2,051 2,448 2,343 Total consumer loans and leases 34,364 32,702 28,899 26,504 24,587 Total loans and leases $ 75,503 71,229 60,367 54,189 49,286 Loans and Leases Total loans and leases increased six percent compared to December 31, 2005. Table 18 presents the Bancorps total commercial and consumer loan and lease portfolio by the primary purpose of the loan. During 2006, the Bancorp reviewed its loan classifications, which resulted in a reclassification of approximately $450 million of commercial loans to commercial mortgage. The impact to average loans was immaterial as the reclassification took place at the end of 2006. Prior year balances were not restated. Total loans and leases grew in over half of its affiliates with double-digit growth in the Cleveland, Detroit, Lexington, Nashville, Orlando and Tampa markets. Total commercial loans and leases increased $2.6 billion, or seven percent, compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the 2006 reclassification, commercial loans increased $1.9 billion or 10%, and commercial mortgage increased by approximately $800 million, or eight percent, compared to December 31, 2005. The mix of commercial loans was consistent with the prior year. Total consumer loans and leases increased five percent compared to December 31, 2005 as a result of the introduction of new residential mortgage products and increased promotion of credit cards. Residential mortgage loans increased $930 million, or 11%, compared to 2005. Comparisons to prior years are dependent upon the volume and timing of originations as well as the timing of loan sales. Residential mortgage originations totaled $9.4 billion in 2006 compared to $9.9 billion in 2005. Credit card balances increased 28% to $1.1 billion. A key focus for the Bancorp in 2007 is increasing its penetration of credit cards within in its retail footprint. Consumer lease balances decreased 33% from December 31, 2005 largely due to continued competitive pricing from captive financing companies. Average commercial loans and leases increased $3.8 billion, or 10%, compared to the December 31, 2005. The Bancorp experienced double-digit growth in more than half of its affiliates, including 15% in the Florida markets, 18% in Tennessee and Chicago and 26% in Cleveland. The growth in average consumer loans and leases was a result of strong growth in each category mitigated by a decline in consumer auto leases. Average consumer loans and leases increased $2.0 billion, or six percent, compared to 2005, highlighted by 33% growth in both the Florida and Tennessee markets.

Securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in managements judgment, they may be sold in response to or in anticipation of changes in market conditions. The Bancorps management has evaluated the securities in an unrealized loss position in the available-for-sale portfolio and maintains the intent and ability to hold these securities to the earlier of the recovery of the losses or maturity. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Bancorp evaluated its overall balance sheet composition and took certain actions with respect to its available-for-sale securities portfolio. The Bancorps objective was to improve the asset/liability profile of the Bancorp and reduce the size of its available-for-sale securities portfolio to a size that is more consistent with its liquidity, collateral and interest rate risk management requirements, improve composition of the balance sheet with a lower concentration in fixed-rate assets, lower wholesale borrowings to reduce leverage and better position the Bancorp for an uncertain economic and interest rate environment. On November 20, 2006, the Bancorps Board of Directors approved the following actions with respect to the Bancorps available-for-sale securities portfolio: (i) sales of $11.3 billion in available-for-sale securities, with a weighted-average yield of approximately 4.30% and (ii) reinvestment of approximately $2.8 billion in available-for-sale securities that are more efficient when used as collateral for pledging purposes. The subsequent sale of available-for-sale securities later in the fourth quarter resulted in pretax losses of $398 million. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2006, the Bancorp sold $726 million of FHLMC callable debt, which represented nearly all of its position in these securities, in order to reduce its credit exposure as a result of recent market events. Net unrealized losses on the available-for-sale securities portfolio were $183 million at December 31, 2006 compared to $609 million at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2006, 95% of the unrealized losses in the available-for-sale securities portfolio were comprised of securities issued by U.S. Treasury and Government agencies, U.S. Government sponsored agencies and states and political subdivisions as well as agency mortgage-backed securities. The Bancorp believes the price movements in these securities were the result of movement in market interest rates. On an amortized cost basis, at the end of 2006, available-for-sale securities decreased $11.3 billion since December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, available-for-sale securities have decreased to 13% of interest-earning assets, compared to 24% at December 31, 2005. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale portfolio was 4.3 years at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, the fixed-rate securities within the available-for-sale securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 5.13%. Information presented in Table 20 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using historical cost balances. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale portfolio exclude equity securities that have no stated yield or maturity.

The Bancorp is continuing to focus on transaction account deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises by expanding its retail franchise, enhancing its product offering and providing competitive rates. The Bancorps goal is to continue to grow the core deposit component of its funding profile. At December 31, 2006, core deposits represented 61% of the Bancorps asset funding base, compared to 57% at December 31, 2005. Core deposits grew two percent compared to December 31, 2005, but the Bancorp continues to realize a mix shift as customers move from lower-yield transaction accounts to higher-yield time deposits. Overall, transaction deposits balances remained stable compared to the prior year. Foreign office deposits represent U.S. dollar denominated deposits of the Bancorps foreign branch located in the Cayman Islands. The Bancorp utilizes these deposit as well as certificates $100,000 and over as a method to fund earning asset growth. On an average basis, core deposits increased five percent while continuing to realize a mix shift within core deposits compared to 2005. The Bancorp realized strong double-digit growth in savings, money market and other time deposits mitigated by decreases in demand and interest checking deposits. The Bancorp experienced double-digit average transaction deposit increases in the Indianapolis, Tampa, Orlando, Lexington and Louisville markets.

The Bancorps risk management function is responsible for the identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting of risk and mitigation of those risks that are inconsistent with the Bancorps risk profile. The Enterprise Risk Management division, led by the Bancorps Chief Risk Officer, ensures consistency in the Bancorps approach to managing and monitoring risk within the structure of the Bancorps affiliate operating model. The risks faced by the Bancorp include, but are not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational and regulatory compliance. In addition, the Internal Audit division provides an independent assessment of the Bancorps internal control structure and related systems and processes. The Enterprise Risk Management division includes the following key functions:  Risk Policy - ensures consistency in the approach to risk management as the Bancorps clearinghouse for credit, market and operational risk policies, procedures and guidelines;  Operational Risk Management - responsible for the risk self-assessment process, the change control evaluation process, fraud prevention and detection, and root cause analysis and corrective action plans relating to identified operational losses;  Insurance Risk Management - responsible for all property, casualty and liability insurance policies including the claims administration process for the Bancorp;  Capital Markets Risk Management - responsible for establishing and monitoring proprietary trading limits, monitoring liquidity and interest rate risk and utilizing value at risk and earnings at risk models;  Credit Risk Review - responsible for evaluating the sufficiency of underwriting, documentation and approval processes for consumer and commercial credits, counter-party credit risk, the accuracy of risk grades assigned to commercial credit exposures, and appropriate accounting for charge-offs, non-accrual status and specific reserves;  Compliance Risk Management - responsible for oversight of compliance with all banking regulations;  Risk Strategies and Reporting - responsible for quantitative analytics and Board of Directors and senior management reporting on credit, market and operational risk metrics; and  Investment Advisors Risk Management - responsible for trust compliance, fiduciary risk and trading risk in the Investment Advisors line of business. Designated risk managers have been assigned to the business lines reporting directly to the Enterprise Risk Management division and indirectly to senior executives within the division or affiliate. Affiliate risk management is handled by regional risk managers who are responsible for multiple affiliates and who report jointly to affiliate presidents and the Enterprise Risk Management division. Risk management oversight and governance is provided by the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and through multiple management committees whose membership includes a broad cross-section of line of business, affiliate and support representatives. The Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors consists of three outside directors and has the responsibility for the oversight of credit, market, operational, regulatory compliance and strategic risk management activities for the Bancorp as well as for the Bancorps overall aggregate risk profile. The Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors has approved the formation of key management governance committees that are responsible for evaluating risks and controls. These committees include the Market Risk Committee, the Credit Risk Committee, the Operational Risk Committee and the Executive Asset Liability Risk Committee. There are also new products and initiatives processes applicable to every line of business to ensure an appropriate standard readiness assessment is performed before launching a new product or initiative. Significant risk policies approved by the management governance committees are also reviewed and approved by the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. 38 Fifth Third Bancorp MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TABLE 25: COMMERCIAL LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO EXPOSURE (a) 2006 2005 As of December 31 ($ in millions) Outstanding Exposure Nonaccrual Outstanding Exposure Nonaccrual By industry: Real estate $10,652 13,196 50 9,503 11,689 32 Construction 5,490 8,963 69 4,911 8,094 49 Manufacturing 5,198 11,443 22 4,457 9,975 47 Retail trade 3,655 6,515 27 3,602 5,962 18 Transportation and warehousing 2,097 2,432 4 1,701 1,993 6 Business services 1,862 3,640 16 1,886 3,351 13 Healthcare 1,860 3,208 9 1,664 2,844 10 Wholesale trade 1,827 3,642 11 1,879 3,540 9 Financial services and insurance 1,509 4,855 8 1,111 3,069 1 Individuals 1,364 1,785 13 1,840 2,371 12 Other services 959 1,373 14 945 1,260 9 Accommodation and food 860 1,323 10 997 1,396 9 Public administration 792 930 - 830 1,004 - Agribusiness 609 782 8 569 752 2 Entertainment and recreation 602 841 2 527 749 3 Other 578 1,269 4 1,041 1,596 3 Communication and information 567 1,073 1 544 1,119 4 Utilities 370 1,187 - 301 1,001 - Mining 288 637 3 219 419 - Total $41,139 69,094 271 38,527 62,184 227 By loan size: Less than $200,000 4 % 3 13 5 4 14 $200,000 to $1 million 16 12 34 19 15 34 $1 million to $5 million 32 27 48 34 28 33 $5 million to $10 million 17 16 5 18 20 8 $10 million to $25 million 21 24 - 18 19 - Greater than $25 million 10 18 - 6 14 11 Total 100 % 100 100 100 100 100 By state: Ohio 25 % 28 36 26 29 30 Michigan 22 19 19 22 21 21 Illinois 10 10 8 10 10 8 Florida 10 9 9 10 9 4 Indiana 9 9 15 10 10 25 Kentucky 6 6 8 6 6 6 Tennessee 3 3 1 3 2 3 Pennsylvania 1 2 - 1 1 - Missouri 1 1 - 1 1 - West Virginia - - - - - 1 Out-of-footprint 13 13 4 11 11 2 Total 100 % 100 100 100 100 100 (a) Outstanding reflects total commercial customer loan and lease balances, including held for sale and net of unearned income, and exposure reflects total commercial customer lending commitments. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT The objective of the Bancorps credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from an individual customer default. The Bancorps credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. The Bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices. These practices include conservative exposure and counterparty limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collection standards. The Bancorps credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and monthly management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Lending officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts, the utilization of which is closely monitored. Lending activities are largely decentralized, while the Enterprise Risk Management division manages the policy and authority delegation process centrally. The Credit Risk Review function, within the Enterprise Risk Management division, provides objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk grades and the charge-off and reserve analysis process. The Bancorps credit review process and overall assessment of required allowances is based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses these assessments to promptly identify potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio, maintain an adequate reserve and take any necessary charge-offs. In addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems. The risk grading system currently utilized for reserve analysis purposes encompasses ten categories. The Bancorp also maintains a dual risk rating system that provides for thirteen probability of default grade categories and an additional six grade categories for estimating actual losses given an event of default. The probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the ten-grade risk rating system. The Bancorp is in the process of completing significant validation and testing of the dual risk rating system prior to implementation for reserve analysis purposes. The dual risk rating system is expected to be consistent with Basel II expectations and allows for more precision in the analysis of commercial credit risk. Scoring systems and delinquency monitoring are used to assess the credit risk in the Bancorps homogenous consumer loan portfolios.

As of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, these advances were $14 million, $13 million and $23 million, respectively. Information prior to December 31, 2004 was not available. (b) At December 31, 2004, the reserve for unfunded commitments was reclassified from the allowance for loan and lease losses to other liabilities. The 2003 year-end reserve for unfunded commitments has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Portfolio Diversity The Bancorps credit risk management strategy includes minimizing concentrations of risk through diversification. Table 25 provides breakouts of the commercial loan and lease portfolio, including held for sale, by major industry classification, by loan size and by state, illustrating the diversity and granularity of the Bancorps portfolio. The commercial portfolio is characterized by 87% of outstanding balances and exposures concentrated within the Bancorps primary market areas of Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Florida, Tennessee, West Virginia, Missouri and Pennsylvania. Exclusive of a national large-ticket leasing business, the commercial portfolio is characterized by 94% of outstanding balances and 91% of exposures concentrated within these ten states. The mortgage and construction segments of the commercial portfolio are characterized by 97% of outstanding balances and 96% of exposures concentrated within these ten states. Analysis of Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming assets include: (i) nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectibility of the full amount of the principal and/or interest is uncertain; (ii) loans and leases that have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower and (iii) other assets, including other real estate owned and repossessed equipment. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the principal or interest is past due 90 days or more (unless the loan is both well secured and in process of collection) and payment of the full principal and/or interest under the contractual terms of the loan are not expected. Additionally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon deterioration of the financial condition of the borrower. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrual of interest, amortization of loan premium, accretion of loan discount and amortization or accretion of deferred net loan fees or costs are discontinued and previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed. Commercial loans on nonaccrual status are reviewed for impairment at least quarterly. If the principal or a portion of principal is deemed a loss, the loss amount is charged off to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Total nonperforming assets were $455 million at December 31, 2006, an increase of $94 million compared to $361 million at December 31, 2005. Nonperforming assets remain a small percentage of total loans, leases and other assets, including other real estate owned at .61% as of December 31, 2006, compared to .52% as of December 31, 2005. Commercial nonaccrual credits as a percent of commercial loans increased from .59% in 2005 to .66% in 2006 primarily due to increases in the Indianapolis and Cleveland markets offset by a decrease in the Cincinnati market. Consumer nonaccrual loans as a percent of loans increased slightly from .20% in 2005 to .24% in 2006. Overall, nonaccrual loans continue to represent a small portion of the portfolio at just .47% as of December 31, 2006, compared to .41% as of December 31, 2005. Total loans and leases 90 days past due have increased from $155 million as of December 31, 2005 to $210 million as of December 31, 2006. The $55 million increase from the prior year was evenly distributed between commercial and consumer loans and leases. At December 31, 2006, there were $24 million of loans and leases currently performing in accordance with contractual terms, but for which there were serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with such terms. For the years 2006 and 2005, interest income of $10 million and $8 million, respectively, was recorded on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans and leases. For the years ended 2006 and 2005, additional interest income of $85 million and $53 million, respectively, would have been recorded if the nonaccrual and renegotiated loans and leases had been current in accordance with the original terms. Analysis of Net Loan Charge-offs Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans and leases were 44 bp for 2006, compared to 45 bp for 2005. The ratio of commercial loan net charge-offs to average commercial loans outstanding increased to 53 bp in 2006 compared to 41 bp in 2005 due to increases in net charge-offs in the Indianapolis and Southern Indiana markets, partially offset by a decrease in the Cincinnati market. The net charge-off ratio for commercial mortgage loans increased 15 bp due to increased net charge-offs in the Indianapolis, Chicago and Cleveland markets. The net charge-off ratio for commercial lease financing decreased 109 bp in 2006. The comparison to prior year is impacted by approximately $27 million in charge-offs related to bankrupt commercial airline carriers during 2005. Consumer lease financing net losses charged off decreased to $5 million as a result of decreased net charge-offs in nearly all affiliate markets and lower averages balances. Overall, the level of net charge-offs remains a small percentage of the total loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp expects net charge-offs to be in the low to mid 50 bp range in 2007.

Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is comprised of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments. The allowance for loan and lease losses provides coverage for probable and estimable losses in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp evaluates the allowance each quarter to determine its adequacy to cover inherent losses. Several factors are taken into consideration in the determination of the overall allowance for loan and lease losses, including the unallocated component. These factors include, but are not limited to, the overall risk profile of the loan and lease portfolios, net charge-off experience, the extent of impaired loans and leases, the level of nonaccrual loans and leases, the level of 90 days past due loans and leases and the overall percentage level of the allowance for loan and lease losses. The Bancorp also considers overall asset quality trends, credit administration and portfolio management practices, risk identification practices, credit policy and underwriting practices, overall portfolio growth, portfolio concentrations and current national and local economic conditions that might impact the portfolio. In 2006, the Bancorp has not substantively changed any material aspect to its overall approach in the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period allowance. In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments. The methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the Bancorps methodology for determining the allowance for loan and lease losses. The provision for unfunded commitments is included in other noninterest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Table 28 shows the changes in the allowance for credit losses during 2006. Certain inherent but undetected losses are probable within the loan and lease portfolio. An unallocated component to the allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained to recognize this imprecision in estimating and measuring loss.

The 2003 year-end reserve for unfunded commitments has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. impaired commercial credits and other qualitative adjustments. Approximately 85% of the required reserves come from the baseline historical loss rates, specific reserve estimates and current credit grades; while 15% comes from qualitative adjustments. As a result, the required reserves tend to slightly lag the deterioration in the portfolio due to the heavy reliance on realized historical losses and the credit grade rating process. Consequently, a larger unallocated reserve is required towards the end of the stronger part of the credit cycle. As the credit cycle deteriorates and the actual loss rates and downgrades increase, the Bancorps methodology will result in a lower unallocated reserve as the incurred losses get reflected into the main components of the methodology that drive the majority of the required reserve calculations. Unallocated reserves as a percent of total portfolio loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2006 were .06% compared to .20% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2006 decreased to 1.04% of the total portfolio loans and leases compared to 1.06% at December 31, 2005. Overall, the Bancorps long history of low exposure limits, minimal exposure to national or sub-prime lending businesses, centralized risk management and its diversified portfolio reduces the likelihood of significant unexpected credit losses. Table 29 provides the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses by category. Residential Mortgage Portfolio Certain mortgage products have contractual features that may increase credit exposure to the Bancorp in the event of a decline in housing prices. These types of mortgage products offered by the Bancorp include high loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, multiple loans on the same collateral that when combined result in a high LTV (80/20) and interest-only loans. Table 30 shows the Bancorps originations of these products in 2006 and 2005. The Bancorp does not currently originate mortgage loans that permit principal payment deferral or payments that are less than the accruing interest. Table 31 provides the amount of these loans as a percent of the residential mortgage loans in the Bancorps portfolio and the delinquency rates of these loan products as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Bancorp also sells certain of these mortgage products in the secondary market with recourse. The outstanding balances and delinquency rates for these loans sold with recourse as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $1.2 billion and 1.74% and $1.2 billion and 1.24%, respectively. The Bancorp manages credit risk in the mortgage portfolio through conservative underwriting and documentation standards and geographic and product diversification. The Bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio without recourse or may purchase mortgage insurance for the loans sold in order to mitigate credit risk. 42 Fifth Third Bancorp MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TABLE 30: RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS For the years ended December 31 ($ in millions) 2006 Percent of total 2005 Percent of total Greater than 80% LTV with no mortgage insurance $679 7 % $ 1,245 13 % Interest-only 1,283 14 1,240 13 Greater than 80% LTV and interest-only 180 2 408 4 80/20 loans 431 5 445 5 TABLE 31: RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE OUTSTANDINGS 2006 2005 As of December 31 ($ in millions) Balance Percent of total DelinquencyRatio Balance Percent of total DelinquencyRatio Greater than 80% LTV with no mortgage insurance $ 1,893 23 % 3.79 % $ 1,773 25 % 3.11 % Interest-only 1,227 15 .14 899 13 .41 Greater than 80% LTV and interest-only 560 7 1.15 361 5 .07 80/20 loans 28 - .72 28 - - MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk arises from the potential for fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices that may result in the potential reduction of net income. Interest rate risk, a component of market risk, is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income or financial position due to changes in interest rates. Management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings. Interest rate risk can occur for any one or more of the following reasons:  Assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times;  Short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts; or  The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. In addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on net interest income, interest rates can indirectly impact earnings through their effect on loan demand, credit losses, mortgage origination fees, the value of servicing rights and other sources of the Bancorps earnings. Consistency of the Bancorps net interest income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk. As a result of the ongoing analysis of the Bancorps interest rate risk profile, management recommended and the Bancorps Board of Directors approved a decision on November 20, 2006 to reduce the size of the available-for-sale securities portfolio. This action was undertaken in order to, among other reasons, improve the composition of the Bancorps balance sheet with a lower concentration of fixed-rate assets and better position the Bancorp for an uncertain economic and interest rate environment. Management continues to review the Bancorps balance sheet composition and to model the interest rate risk, and possible actions to reduce this risk, given numerous future interest rate scenarios. Net Interest Income Simulation Model The Bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to changing interest rates. The model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the Bancorps financial instruments and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities. The model also includes senior management projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the Bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions on the balance sheet. Actual results will differ from these simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies. The Bancorps Executive Asset Liability Committee (ALCO), which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors, monitors and manages interest rate risk within Board approved policy limits. In addition to the risk management activities of ALCO, the Bancorp has a Market Risk Management function as part of the Enterprise Risk Management division that provides independent oversight of market risk activities. The Bancorps current interest rate risk policy limits are determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over 12-month and 24-month horizons assuming a 200 bp parallel ramped increase or decrease in market interest rates. In accordance with the current policy, the rate movements are assumed to occur over one year and are sustained thereafter. The following table shows the Bancorps estimated earnings sensitivity profile and the ALCO policy limits on the asset and liability positions as of December 31, 2006: TABLE 32: ESTIMATED EARNINGS SENSITIVITY PROFILE Change in Net InterestIncome (FTE) ALCO Policy Limits Change in Interest Rates (bp) 12Months 13 to 24 Months 12Months 13 to 24 Months +200 (.29)% .45 (5.00) (7.00) +100 .01 .20 - - -100 .07 (.43) - - -200 .41 (2.27) (5.00) (7.00) Economic Value of Equity The Bancorp also employs economic value of equity (EVE) as a measurement tool in managing interest rate sensitivity. Whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, the EVE analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions. The EVE of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of asset and derivative cash flows less the discounted value of liability cash flows. The sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. In contrast to the net interest income simulation, which assumes interest rates will change over a period of time, EVE uses instantaneous changes in rates. EVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model. As with the net interest income simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the transaction deposit portfolios. The following table shows the Bancorps EVE sensitivity profile as of December 31, 2006: TABLE 33: ESTIMATED EVE SENSITIVITY PROFILE Change in EVE Change in Interest Rates (bp) 2006 ALCO Policy Limits +200 (3.98)% (20.0) -200 2.52 (20.0) Fifth Third Bancorp 43 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS At December 31, 2006, the Bancorp has reduced its sensitivity, relative to December 31, 2005, to the impact of an instantaneous rate movement as a result of the balance sheet actions taken during the fourth quarter of 2006. While an instantaneous shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the Bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current fiscal year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The net interest income simulation and EVE analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates. Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk An integral component of the Bancorps interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, principal-only swaps, options and swaptions. As part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity, the Bancorp enters into forward contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically hedge interest rate lock commitments that are also considered free-standing derivatives. The Bancorp also establishes derivative contracts with reputable third parties to economically hedge significant exposures assumed in commercial customer accommodation derivative contracts. Generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the Bancorp from market volatility. Credit risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts, which the Bancorp minimizes through approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The notional amount and fair values of these derivatives as of December 31, 2006 are included in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Portfolio Loans and Leases and Interest Rate Risk Although the Bancorps portfolio loans and leases contain both fixed and floating/adjustable rate products, the rates of interest earned by the Bancorp on the outstanding balances are generally established for a period of time. The interest rate sensitivity of loans and leases is directly related to the length of time the rate earned is established. Table 34 shows a summary of the expected principal cash flows of the Bancorps portfolio loans and leases as of December 31, 2006. Additionally, Table 35 shows a summary of expected principal cash flows occurring after one year as of December 31, 2006. Mortgage Servicing Rights and Interest Rate Risk The net carrying amount of the MSR portfolio was $519 million as of December 31, 2006 compared to $433 million as of December 31, 2005. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity, including consultation with an independent third-party specialist, in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in value of its MSR portfolio as a result of changing interest rates. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans. The increase in interest rates and the resulting impact of changing prepayment speeds led to recoveries of $19 million and $33 million of temporary impairment in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Servicing rights are deemed temporarily impaired when a borrowers loan rate is distinctly higher than prevailing market rates. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on servicing rights. Foreign Currency Risk The Bancorp enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans. The derivatives are classified as free-standing instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded within other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of the Bancorps foreign denominated loans at December 31, 2006 was approximately $196 million compared to approximately $130 million at December 31, 2005. The Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers involved in international trade to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The Bancorp has several internal controls in place to ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These include an independent determination of currency volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts, counterparty credit approvals and country limits.

This goal is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the national money markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits. The estimated weighted-average life of the available-for-sale portfolio was 4.3 years at December 31, 2006, based on current prepayment expectations. Of the $11.1 billion (fair value basis) of securities in the available-for-sale portfolio at December 31, 2006, $3.0 billion in principal and interest is expected to be received in the next 12 months, and an additional $1.6 billion is expected to be received in the next 13 to 24 months. In addition to the sale of securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, asset-driven liquidity is provided by the Bancorps ability to sell or securitize loan and lease assets. In order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the Bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of interest-sensitive assets. A majority of the long-term, fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to FHLMC or Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) guidelines are sold for cash upon origination. Additional assets such as jumbo fixed-rate residential mortgages, certain floating-rate short-term commercial loans, certain floating-rate home equity loans, certain auto loans and other consumer loans are also capable of being securitized, sold or transferred off-balance sheet. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, a total of $9.2 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively, were sold, securitized or transferred off-balance sheet. Additionally, the Bancorp has a shelf registration in place with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permitting ready access to the public debt markets and qualifies as a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules. As of December 31, 2006, $750 million of debt or other securities were available for issuance under this shelf registration. The Bancorp also has $15.8 billion of funding available for issuance through private offerings of debt securities pursuant to its bank note program. These sources, in addition to the Bancorps 9.32% average equity capital base, provide a stable funding base. Core deposits have historically provided the Bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. The Bancorps average core deposits and shareholders equity funded 67% of its average total assets during 2006 compared to 64% during 2005. In addition to core deposit funding, the Bancorp also accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which include the use of various regional Federal Home Loan Banks as a funding source. Certificates carrying a balance of $100,000 or more and deposits in the Bancorps foreign branch located in the Cayman Islands are wholesale funding tools utilized to fund asset growth. The maturity distribution for domestic certificates of deposit of $100,000 and over as of December 31, 2006 is shown in Table 36. Management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs. As of December 31, 2006, the Moodys senior debt rating for the Bancorp was Aa3, a rating surpassed by only four other U.S. bank holding companies. Table 37 provides Moodys, Standard and Poors and Fitchs deposit and debt ratings for the Bancorp, Fifth Third Bank and Fifth Third Bank (Michigan). These debt ratings, along with capital ratios above regulatory guidelines, provide the Bancorp with additional access to liquidity. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Bancorp maintains a relatively high level of capital as a margin of safety for its depositors and shareholders. At December 31, 2006, shareholders equity was $10.0 billion compared to $9.4 billion at December 31, 2005, an increase of six percent. The Bancorp is reviewing its capital structure and expects the tangible equity ratio to be approximately 7.0% at the end of 2007. The Bancorp issued $750 million of Tier II-qualifying subordinated debt during 2006. The issuance added approximately 73 bp to the total risk-based capital ratio. The Bancorp expects this ratio to remain at approximately 11.0% in 2007. See Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding regulatory capital ratios. Dividend Policy The Bancorps common stock dividend policy reflects its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to maintain adequate capital levels and alternative investment opportunities. In 2006, the Bancorps annual dividend increased to $1.58 from $1.46 in 2005. Stock Repurchase Program On January 10, 2005, the Bancorp repurchased 35.5 million shares of its common stock, approximately six percent of total outstanding shares, for $1.6 billion in an overnight share repurchase transaction, where the counterparty in the transaction purchased shares in the open market over a period of time. This program was completed by the counterparty during the third quarter of 2005 and the Bancorp received a price adjustment of $97 million in cash. The price adjustment represented the difference between the original per share purchase price of $45.95 and the volume weighted-average price of $43.55 for actual shares acquired by the counterparty during the purchase period, plus interest. This share transaction was considered two separate transactions, (i) the acquisition of treasury shares on the acquisition date and (ii) a forward contract indexed to the Bancorps stock. The treasury shares were accounted for at cost Fifth Third Bancorp 45 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TABLE 38: CAPITAL RATIOS As of December 31 ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Average equity as a percent of average assets 9.32 % 9.06 9.34 10.01 11.08 Tangible equity as a percent of tangible assets 7.79 6.87 8.35 8.56 9.54 Tier I capital $8,625 8,209 8,522 8,168 7,656 Total risk-based capital 11,385 10,240 10,176 9,992 8,844 Risk-weighted assets 102,823 98,293 82,633 74,477 65,444 Regulatory capital ratios: Tier I capital 8.39 % 8.35 10.31 10.97 11.70 Total risk-based capital 11.07 10.42 12.31 13.42 13.51 Tier I leverage 8.44 8.08 8.89 9.11 9.73 TABLE 39: SHARE REPURCHASES For the years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Shares authorized for repurchase at January 1 17,846,953 35,685,112 14,137,512 Additional authorizations - 20,000,000 40,000,000 Shares repurchases (a) (2,039,908) (37,838,159) (18,452,400) Shares authorized for repurchase at December 31 15,807,045 17,846,953 35,685,112 Average price paid per share $39.72 $43.19 53.48 (a) Excludes 357,612, 134,435 and 40,850 shares repurchased during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in connection with various employee compensation plans.

The forward contract indexed to the Bancorps stock qualified for equity classification. Additionally, for diluted earnings per share purposes the Bancorp assumed the transaction would be net settled in shares as the Bancorp had the choice of settling in cash or shares and the Bancorp did not have a stated policy or the ability to demonstrate a past practice of cash settlement. These incremental shares were subsequently excluded from quarterly earnings per share calculations, as the effect of inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. On January 18, 2005, the Bancorp announced that its Board of Directors had authorized management to purchase 20 million shares of the Bancorps common stock through the open market or in any private transaction. The timing of the purchases and the exact number of shares to be purchased depends upon market conditions. The authorization does not include specific price targets or an expiration date. At December 31, 2006, the Bancorp had 15.8 million shares remaining under this authorization. The Bancorps stock repurchase program is an important element of its capital planning activities and the Bancorp views share repurchases as an effective means of delivering value to shareholders. The Bancorps repurchase of equity securities is shown in Table 39. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Bancorp consolidates all of its majority-owned subsidiaries. Other entities, including certain joint ventures, in which there is greater than 20% ownership, but upon which the Bancorp does not possess, nor can exert, significant influence or control, are accounted for by equity method accounting and not consolidated. Those entities in which there is less than 20% ownership are generally carried at the lower of cost or fair value. The Bancorp has no material contracts for which a lack of marketplace quotations requires the estimation of fair value. The Bancorps derivative product policy and investment policies provide a framework within which the Bancorp and its affiliates may use certain authorized financial derivatives as a market risk management tool in meeting the Bancorps ALCO capital planning directives and to hedge changes in fair value of its largely fixed-rate mortgage servicing rights portfolio. The Bancorp also provides qualifying commercial customers access to the derivative market, including foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity contracts. The Bancorp may economically hedge significant exposures related to these derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of customers by entering into offsetting contracts with approved, reputable, independent counterparties with matching terms that are generally settled daily. These policies are reviewed and approved annually by the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. Through December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Bancorp had transferred, subject to credit recourse, certain primarily floating-rate, short-term investment grade commercial loans to an unconsolidated qualified special purpose entity (QSPE) that is wholly owned by an independent third-party. Generally, the loans transferred provide a lower yield due to their investment grade nature, and therefore transferring these loans to the QSPE allows the Bancorp to reduce its exposure to these lower yielding loan assets while maintaining the customer relationships. The outstanding balance of such loans at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $3.4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. These loans may be transferred back to the Bancorp upon the occurrence of certain specified events. These events include borrower default on the loans transferred, bankruptcy preferences initiated against underlying borrowers and ineligible loans transferred by the Bancorp to the QSPE. The maximum amount of credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the underlying borrowers is approximately equivalent to the total outstanding balance of $3.4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2006 and 2005. In addition, the Bancorps agreement to provide liquidity support to the QSPE was $3.8 billion as of year end 2006 compared to $3.4 billion as of year end 2005. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Bancorps loss reserve related to the liquidity support and credit enhancement provided to the QSPE was $16 million and $10 million, respectively. The Bancorp had the following cash flows with these unconsolidated QSPEs during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: TABLE 40: CASH FLOWS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED QSPEs For the years ended December 31 ($ in millions) 2006 2005 Proceeds from transfers, including new securitizations $ 1,618 1,680 Proceeds from collections reinvested in revolving-period securitizations 97 132 Fees received 35 32 The Bancorp utilizes securitization trusts formed by independent third parties to facilitate the securitization process of residential mortgage loans, certain floating-rate home equity lines of credit, certain auto loans and other consumer loans. The cash flows to and from the securitization trusts are principally limited to the initial proceeds from the securitization trust at the time of sale with subsequent cash flows relating to retained interests. The Bancorps securitization policy permits the retention of subordinated tranches, servicing rights, interest-only strips, residual interests, credit recourse and, in some cases, a cash reserve account. At December 31, 2006, the Bancorp had retained servicing assets totaling $524 million, subordinated 46 Fifth Third Bancorp MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS tranche security interests totaling $15 million and residual interests totaling $21 million. At December 31, 2005, the Bancorp had retained servicing assets totaling $441 million, subordinated tranche security interests totaling $30 million and residual interests totaling $35 million. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Bancorp had provided credit recourse on approximately $1.3 billion of residential mortgage loans sold to unrelated third parties. In the event of any customer default, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, the Bancorp is required to reimburse the third party. The maximum amount of credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the underlying borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance. In the event of nonperformance, the Bancorp has rights to the underlying collateral value attached to the loan. The Bancorp maintained an estimated credit loss reserve of approximately $18 million and $21 million relating to these residential mortgage loans sold at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. To determine the credit loss reserve, the Bancorp used an approach that is consistent with its overall approach in estimating credit losses for various categories of residential mortgage loans held in its loan portfolio. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The Bancorp has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts. At December 31, 2006, the aggregate contractual obligations and commitments were: TABLE 41: CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS As of December 31, 2006 ($ in millions) Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years Greater than 5 years Total Contractually obligated payments due by period: Total deposits (a) $ 66,423 1,225 26 1,706 69,380 Long-term debt (b) 2,029 3,890 794 5,845 12,558 Short-term borrowings (c) 4,217 - - - 4,217 Noncancelable leases (d) 72 134 112 377 695 Capital expenditures (e) 126 - - - 126 Partnership investment commitments (f) 260 - - - 260 Purchase obligations (g) 15 9 - - 24 Total contractually obligated payments due by period $ 73,142 5,258 932 7,928 87,260 Other commitments by expiration period: Letters of credit (h) $ 2,877 3,024 1,773 489 8,163 Commitments to extend credit (h) 23,962 18,123 - - 42,085 Total other commitments by expiration period $ 26,839 21,147 1,773 489 50,248 (a) Includes demand, interest checking, savings, money market, other time, certificates $100,000 and over and foreign office deposits. For additional information, see the Deposits discussion in the Balance Sheet Analysis section of Managements Discussion and Analysis. (b) In the banking industry, interest-bearing obligations are principally used to fund interest-earning assets. As such, interest charges on contractual obligations were excluded from reported amounts, as the potential cash outflows would have corresponding cash inflows from interest-earning assets. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these debt instruments. (c) Includes federal funds purchased, bank notes, securities sold under repurchase agreements and borrowings with an original maturity of less than one year. For additional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these noncancelable leases.

Fifth Third Bancorp 47 MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Management of Fifth Third Bancorp is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the Bancorp) includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the Bancorp; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Bancorp are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Bancorp; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Bancorps assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. The Bancorps Management assessed the effectiveness of the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Managements assessment is based on the criteria established in the Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and was designed to provide reasonable assurance that the Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. Based on this assessment, Management believes that the Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. The Bancorps independent registered public accounting firm, that audited the Bancorps consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 and Bancorp Managements assessment of the internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on the following page. George A. Schaefer, Jr. Christopher G. Marshall Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer February 15, 2007 February 15, 2007 48 Fifth Third Bancorp REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp: We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Assessment as to the Effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the Bancorp) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Bancorps management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that the Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Bancorp maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 of the Bancorp and our report dated February 15, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Cincinnati, Ohio February 15, 2007 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the Bancorp) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Bancorps management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 15, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES Nature of Operations Fifth Third Bancorp (Bancorp), an Ohio corporation, conducts its principal lending, deposit gathering, transaction processing and service advisory activities through its banking and non-banking subsidiaries from banking centers located throughout Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Florida, Tennessee, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Missouri. Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Bancorp and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Other entities, including certain joint ventures, in which there is greater than 20% ownership, but upon which the Bancorp does not possess, nor can it exert, significant influence or control, are accounted for by the equity method and not consolidated; those in which there is less than 20% ownership are generally carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain prior period data has been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Such reclassifications have no effect on previously reported consolidated financial positions or results of operation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Securities Securities are classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading on the date of purchase. Only those securities classified as held-to-maturity, and which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported at amortized cost. Securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in managements judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. The Bancorps management has evaluated the securities in an unrealized loss position in the available-for-sale portfolio and maintains the intent and ability to hold these securities to the earlier of the recovery of the losses or maturity. Available-for-sale and trading securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred income taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income and other noninterest income, respectively. The fair value of a security is determined based on quoted market prices. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on quoted prices of similar instruments. Realized securities gains or losses are reported within noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities are reviewed quarterly for possible other-than-temporary impairment. The review includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individual investment such as the severity of loss, the length of time the fair value has been below cost, the expectation for that securitys performance, the creditworthiness of the issuer and managements intent and ability to hold the security to recovery. A decline in value that is considered to be other-than-temporary is recorded as a loss within noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Loans and Leases Interest income on loans and leases is based on the principal balance outstanding computed using the effective interest method. The accrual of interest income for commercial loans is discontinued when there is a clear indication that the borrowers cash flow may not be sufficient to meet payments as they become due. Such loans are also placed on nonaccrual status when the principal or interest is past due ninety days or more, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans and revolving lines of credit for equity lines that have principal and interest payments that have become past due one hundred and twenty days and residential mortgage loans and credit cards that have principal and interest payments that have become past due one hundred and eighty days are charged off to the allowance for loan and lease losses. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all previously accrued and unpaid interest is charged against income and the loan is accounted for on the cost recovery method thereafter, until qualifying for return to accrual status. Generally, a loan is returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal payments become current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement or when the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Loan and lease origination and commitment fees and direct loan and lease origination costs are deferred and the net amount amortized over the estimated life of the related loans, leases or commitments as a yield adjustment. Direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments plus estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. Interest income on direct financing leases is recognized over the term of the lease to achieve a constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding investment. Interest income on leveraged leases is recognized over the term of the lease to achieve a constant rate of return on the outstanding investment in the lease, net of the related deferred income tax liability, in the years in which the net investment is positive. Conforming residential mortgage loans are typically classified as held for sale upon origination based upon managements intent to sell all the production of these loans. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are valued at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Additionally, the carrying value of loans held for sale designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge transaction are adjusted for changes in their fair value over the term of the hedging relationship. Fair value is based on the contract price at which the mortgage loans will be sold. The Bancorp generally has commitments to sell residential mortgage loans held for sale in the secondary market. Gains or losses on sales are recognized in mortgage banking net revenue upon delivery. Impaired loans and leases are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral. The Bancorp evaluates the collectibility of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual. Other Real Estate Owned Other real estate owned (OREO), which is included in other assets, represents property acquired through foreclosure or other proceedings. OREO is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell. All property is periodically evaluated and reductions in carrying value are recognized in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The Bancorp maintains an allowance to absorb probable loan and lease losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance is maintained at a level the Bancorp considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectibility and historical loss experience of loans and leases. Credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance. Provisions for loan and lease losses are based on the Bancorps review of the historical credit loss experience and such factors that, in managements judgment, deserve consideration under existing economic conditions in estimating probable credit losses. In determining the appropriate level of the allowance, the Bancorp estimates losses using a range derived from base and conservative estimates. 54 Fifth Third Bancorp NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review. Where appropriate, allowances are allocated to individual loans based on managements estimate of the borrowers ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral, other sources of cash flow and legal options available to the Bancorp. The review of individual loans includes those loans that are impaired as provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan. Any allowances for impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or fair value of the underlying collateral. The Bancorp evaluates the collectibility of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual. Historical loss rates are applied to other commercial loans not subject to specific allowance allocations. The loss rates are derived from a migration analysis, which computes the net charge-off experience sustained on loans according to their internal risk grade. The risk grading system utilized for allowance analysis purposes encompasses ten categories. The Bancorp also maintains a dual risk rating system that provides for thirteen probability of default grade categories and an additional six grade categories measuring loss factors given an event of default. The probability of default and loss given default analyses are not separated in the ten grade risk rating system. The Bancorp is in the process of completing significant validation and testing of the dual risk rating system prior to implementation for allowance analysis purposes. The dual risk rating system is consistent with Basel II expectations and allows for more precision in the analysis of commercial credit risk. Homogenous loans and leases, such as consumer installment, residential mortgage and automobile leases are not individually risk graded. Rather, standard credit scoring systems and delinquency monitoring are used to assess credit risks. Allowances are established for each pool of loans based on the expected net charge-offs for one year. Loss rates are based on the average net charge-off history by loan category. Historical loss rates for commercial and consumer loans may be adjusted for significant factors that, in managements judgment, reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss recognition. Factors that management considers in the analysis include the effects of the national and local economies, trends in the nature and volume of loans (delinquencies, charge-offs and nonaccrual loans), changes in mix, credit score migration comparisons, asset quality trends, risk management and loan administration, changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards, collection practices and examination results from bank regulatory agencies and the Bancorps internal credit examiners. The Bancorps current methodology for determining the allowance for loan and lease losses is based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on impaired commercial credits and other qualitative adjustments. Allowances on individual loans and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. An unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss when evaluating allowances for individual loans or pools of loans. Loans acquired by the Bancorp through a purchase business combination are evaluated for possible credit impairment. Reduction to the carrying value of the acquired loans as a result of credit impairment is recorded as an adjustment to goodwill. The Bancorp does not carry over the acquired companys allowance for loan and lease losses nor does the Bancorp add to its existing allowance for the acquired loans as part of purchase accounting. The Bancorps primary market areas for lending are Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Florida, Tennessee, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Missouri. When evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is given to this regional geographic concentration and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the Bancorps customers. In the current year, the Bancorp has not substantively changed any aspect to its overall approach in the determination of allowance for loan and lease losses. There have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period allowance for loan and lease losses. Reserve for Unfunded Commitments The reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of historical commitment utilization experience, credit risk grading and credit grade migration. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense. Loan Sales and Securitizations When the Bancorp sells loans through either securitizations or individual loan sales in accordance with its investment policies, it may retain one or more subordinated tranches, servicing rights, interest-only strips, credit recourse, other residual interests and in some cases, a cash reserve account, all of which are considered retained interests in the securitized or sold loans. Gain or loss on sale or securitization of the loans depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the financial assets sold or securitized, allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of sale or securitization. To obtain fair values, quoted market prices are used, if available. If quotes are not available for retained interests, the Bancorp calculates fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows using both managements best estimates and third-party data sources for the key assumptions, including credit losses, prepayment speeds, forward yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. Gain or loss on sale or securitization of loans is reported as a component of noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Retained interests from securitized or sold loans, excluding servicing rights, are carried at fair value. Adjustments to fair value for retained interests classified as available-for-sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income if the fair value has declined below the carrying amount and such decline has been determined to be other-than-temporary. Adjustments to fair value for retained interests classified as trading securities are recorded within noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Servicing rights resulting from residential mortgage, home equity line of credit and automotive loan sales are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing revenues and are reported as a component of mortgage banking net revenue and other noninterest income, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Servicing rights are assessed for impairment monthly, based on fair value, with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance and permanent impairment recognized through a write-off of the servicing asset and related valuation allowance. Key economic assumptions used in measuring any potential impairment of the servicing rights include the prepayment speed of the underlying loans, the weighted-average life of the loans, the discount rate and the weighted-average default rate, as applicable. The primary risk of material changes to the value of the servicing rights resides in the potential volatility in the economic assumptions used, particularly the prepayment speeds. The Bancorp monitors this risk and adjusts its valuation allowance as necessary to adequately Fifth Third Bancorp 55 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS reserve for any probable impairment in the portfolio. For purposes of measuring impairment, the mortgage servicing rights are stratified based on the financial asset type and interest rates. In addition, the Bancorp obtains an independent third-party valuation of the mortgage servicing portfolio on a quarterly basis. Fees received for servicing loans owned by investors are based on a percentage of the outstanding monthly principal balance of such loans and are included in noninterest income as loan payments are received. Costs of servicing loans are charged to expense as incurred. Bank Premises and Equipment Bank premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets for book purposes, while accelerated depreciation is used for income tax purposes. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lives of the related leases or useful lives of the related assets, whichever is shorter. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Bancorp tests its long-lived assets for impairment through both a probability-weighted and primary-asset approach whenever events or changes in circumstances dictate. Maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are charged to noninterest expense as incurred. Derivative Financial Instruments The Bancorp accounts for its derivatives under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. This Statement requires recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and requires measurement of those instruments at fair value through adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income and/or current earnings, as appropriate. On the date the Bancorp enters into a derivative contract, the Bancorp designates the derivative instrument as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or as a free-standing derivative instrument. For a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in current period net income. For a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument, to the extent that it is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to net income in the same period(s) that the hedged transaction impacts net income. For free-standing derivative instruments, changes in fair values are reported in current period net income. Prior to entering into a hedge transaction, the Bancorp formally documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivative instruments that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions, along with a formal assessment at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis as to the effectiveness of the derivative instrument in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued and the adjustment to fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded in net income. Taxes The Bancorp estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which the Bancorp conducts business. On a quarterly basis, management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current estimate of the amount and components of net income, tax credits and the applicable statutory tax rates expected for the full year. The estimated income tax expense is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the balance sheet method and are reported in accrued taxes, interest and expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and recognizes enacted changes in tax rates and laws. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent they exist and are subject to a valuation allowance based on managements judgment that realization is more-likely-than-not. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to taxing jurisdictions and are reported in accrued taxes, interest and expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other information and maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation of these relative risks and merits. Changes to the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being conducted by taxing authorities and changes to statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, can affect deferred taxes and accrued taxes as well as the current periods income tax expense and can be significant to the operating results of the Bancorp. As described in greater detail in Note 13, the Internal Revenue Service is currently challenging the Bancorps tax treatment of certain leasing transactions. For additional information, see Note 21. Earnings Per Share In accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Earnings per diluted share are computed by dividing adjusted net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Dilutive common stock equivalents represent the assumed conversion of convertible preferred stock and the exercise of stock-based awards. Other Securities and other property held by Fifth Third Investment Advisors, a division of the Bancorps banking subsidiaries, in a fiduciary or agency capacity are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets because such items are not assets of the subsidiaries. Investment advisory revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income is recognized on the accrual basis. Investment advisory service revenues are recognized monthly based on a fee charged per transaction processed and/or a fee charged on the market value of ending account balances associated with individual contracts. The Bancorp recognizes revenue from its electronic payment processing services on an accrual basis as such services are performed, recording revenues net of certain costs (primarily interchange fees charged by credit card associations) not controlled by the Bancorp. Acquisitions of treasury stock are carried at cost. Reissuance of shares in treasury for acquisitions, exercises of stock-based awards or other corporate purposes is recorded based on the specific identification method. Advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based 56 Fifth Third Bancorp NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Compensation-Transition and Disclosurean Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. Effective January 1, 2004, the Bancorp adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 using the retroactive restatement method described in SFAS No. 148. As a result, financial information for all periods prior to 2004 has been restated to reflect the compensation expense that would have been recognized had the fair value method of accounting been applied to all awards granted to employees after January 1, 1995. Stock-based compensation expense is included in salaries, wages and incentives expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. This Statement requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award with the cost to be recognized over the vesting period. This Statement was effective for financial statements as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period of the first fiscal year beginning after September 15, 2005. On January 1, 2006, the Bancorp elected to adopt this Statement using the modified retrospective application. Adoption of this Statement had three impacts on the Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements: i) the recognition of a benefit for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of approximately $4 million (net of $2 million of tax) during the first quarter of 2006 due to the recognition of an estimate of forfeiture experience to be realized for all unvested stock-based awards outstanding; ii) the reclassification in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 of $6 million and $9 million, respectively, of net cash provided related to the excess corporate tax benefit received on stock-based compensation, previously recorded in the operating activities section, to the financing activities section and iii) the recognition of approximately $9 million of incremental salaries, wages and incentives expense in the second quarter of 2006 related to the issuance in April 2006 of stock-based awards to retirement-eligible employees. The adoption of this Statement did not have an impact on basic or diluted earnings per share. For further information on stock-based compensation see Note 18. In December 2003, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position (SOP) 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans and Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer. SOP 03-3 addresses the accounting for acquired loans that show evidence of having deteriorated in terms of credit quality since their origination (i.e. impaired loans) and for which a loss is deemed probable of occurring. SOP 03-3 requires acquired loans to be recorded at their fair value, defined as the present value of future cash flows including interest income, to be recognized over the life of the loan. SOP 03-3 prohibits the carryover of an allowance for loan loss on certain acquired loans within its scope considered in the future cash flows assessment. SOP 03-3 was effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004 and has not had a material effect on the Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. The EITF reached a consensus on an other-than-temporary impairment model for debt and equity securities accounted for under SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and cost method investments. In September 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) No. EITF 03-01-1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF 03-01. This FSP delayed the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10-20 of Issue 03-01. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP nullifies certain requirements of Issue 03-1 and supersedes EITF Abstracts, Topic No. D-44, Recognition of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment upon the Planned Sale of a Security Whose Cost Exceeds Fair Value. Based on the clarification provided in FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, the amount of any other-than-temporary impairment that needs to be recognized will continue to be dependent on market conditions, the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances relative to an investee and an entitys intent and ability to hold the impaired investment at the time of the valuation. FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. Adoption of this FSP did not have a material effect on the Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Correctionsa Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. This Statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and FASB Statement No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. This Statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. This Statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle. It also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. This Statement was effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of this Statement did not have a material effect on the Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140. This Statement amends FASB Statements No. 133 and No. 140 as well as resolves issues addressed in Statement No. 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, Application of Statement No. 133 to Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. Specifically, this Statement: i) permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation; ii) clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of Statement No. 133; iii) establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are free-standing derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation; iv) clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives; and v) amends Statement No. 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying SPE from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. This Statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The adoption of this Statement on January 1, 2007 did not have a material effect on the Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 140 and requires that all separately recognized servicing rights be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. For each class of separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities, this Statement permits the Bancorp to choose either to report servicing assets and liabilities at fair value or at amortized Fifth Third Bancorp 57 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS cost. Under the fair value approach, servicing assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recorded in earnings in the period in which the changes occur. Under the amortized cost method, servicing assets and liabilities are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income or net servicing loss and are assessed for impairment based on fair value at each reporting date. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. Upon adoption of this Statement on January 1, 2007, the Bancorp elected to continue to report all classes of servicing assets and liabilities at amortized cost subsequent to initial recognition at fair value. In July 2006, the FASB issued FSP FAS 13-2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction. This FSP addresses the accounting for a change or projected change in the timing of lessor cash flows, but not the total net income, relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction. This FSP amends SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, and applies to all transactions classified as leveraged leases. The timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease is an important assumption that affects the periodic income recognized by the lessor. Under this FSP, the projected timing of income tax cash flows generated by a leveraged lease transaction is required to be reviewed annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a change in timing has occurred or is projected to occur. If during the lease term the expected timing of the income tax cash flows generated by a leveraged lease is revised, the rate of return and the allocation of income would be recalculated from the inception of the lease. Upon adoption, the cumulative effect of the change in the net investment balance resulting from the recalculation will be recognized as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings. On an ongoing basis following the adoption, a change in the net investment balance resulting from a recalculation will be recognized as a gain or a loss in the period in which the assumption changed and included in income from continuing operations in the same line item used when leveraged lease income is recognized. These amounts would then be recognized back into income over the remaining terms of the affected leases. Additionally, upon adoption, only tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be reflected in the financial statements and all recognized tax positions in a leveraged lease must be measured in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, issued in July 2006. During May 2005, the Bancorp filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio related to a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service concerning the timing of deductions associated with certain leveraged lease transactions in its 1997 tax return. The Internal Revenue Service has also proposed adjustments to the tax effects of certain leveraged lease transactions in subsequent tax return years. The proposed adjustments, including penalties, relate to the Bancorps portfolio of lease-in lease-out transactions, service contract leases and qualified technology equipment leases with both domestic and foreign municipalities. The Bancorp is challenging the Internal Revenue Services proposed treatment of all of these leasing transactions. The Bancorps original net investment in these leases totaled approximately $900 million. The Bancorp continues to believe that its treatment of these leveraged leases was appropriate and in compliance with applicable tax law and regulations. While management cannot predict with certainty the result of the suit, given the tax treatment of these transactions has been challenged by the Internal Revenue Service, the Bancorp believes a resolution could involve a projected change in the timing of these leveraged lease cash flows. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Upon adoption of this FSP on January 1, 2007, the Bancorp recognized an after-tax adjustment to beginning retained earnings of $96 million representing the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this FSP. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This Interpretation also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with this Interpretation is a two-step process. The first step is a recognition process to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is assessed to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. This Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this Interpretation will be recognized as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings. Adoption of this Interpretation on January 1, 2007 did not have a material effect on the Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement and should be determined based on assumptions that a market participant would use when pricing an asset or liability. This Statement clarifies that market participant assumptions should include assumptions about risk as well as the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset. Additionally, this Statement establishes a fair value hierarchy that provides the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Bancorp is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this Statement on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). This Statement amends the current accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits by requiring an entity to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. This Statement also requires recognition, as a component of other comprehensive income (net of tax), of the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period, but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost pursuant to SFAS No. 87 and No. 106. Additionally, this Statement requires an entity to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year-end statement of financial position. The Bancorp adopted this Statement on December 31, 2006. The effect of this Statement was to recognize $59 million, after-tax, of 58 Fifth Third Bancorp NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS net actuarial losses and prior service cost as a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 108, Financial Statements  Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. This SAB provides guidance on the consideration of prior year misstatements in determining whether the current years financial statements are materially misstated. In providing this guidance, the SEC staff references both the iron curtain and rollover approaches to quantifying a current year misstatement for purposes of determining materiality. The iron curtain approach focuses on how the current years balance sheet would be affected in correcting misstatements without considering the year in which the misstatement originated. The rollover approach focuses on the amount of the misstatements that originated in the current years income statement. The SEC staff indicates that registrants should quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements, including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements, on the current year financial statements. This SAB is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. Registrants may either restate their financials for any material misstatements arising from the application of this SAB or recognize a cumulative effect of applying SAB 108 within the current year opening balance in retained earnings.

During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Bancorp evaluated its overall balance sheet composition and took certain actions with respect to its available-for-sale securities portfolio. The Bancorps objective was to reduce the size of its available-for-sale securities portfolio to a size that is more consistent with its liquidity, collateral and interest rate risk management requirements, improve the asset/liability profile of the Bancorp and better position the Bancorp for an uncertain economic and interest rate environment. On November 20, 2006, the Bancorps Board of Directors approved the following actions with respect to the Bancorps available-for-sale securities portfolio: (i) sales of $11.3 billion in available-for-sale securities and (ii) reinvestment of approximately $2.8 billion in available-for-sale securities that are more efficient when used as collateral. The sale of available-for-sale securities resulted in pretax losses of $398 million, or $255 million after-tax. In determining the securities to sell, the Bancorp assessed (i) the relative value of the classes of securities in its available-for-sale portfolio; (ii) the Bancorps customer acceptance of using certain classes of securities as forms of collateral; and (iii) the exposure in the portfolio to certain sectors with a changing credit risk profile. As a result of this assessment, the Bancorp sold the following available-for-sale securities in the fourth quarter of 2006: ($ in millions) Available-for-Sale Securities Sold 15-year fixed-rate agency mortgage-backed securities $4,074 Adjustable-rate agency mortgage-backed securities 1,724 U.S. Treasury notes 500 Available-for-sale securities sold due to relative performance 6,298 Agency collateralized mortgage obligations 2,135 Whole loan collateralized mortgage obligations 1,095 Whole loan adjustable rate mortgages 795 Available-for-sale securities sold due to collateral inefficiency 4,025 Agency debentures 798 Other security classes 194 Total $11,315 Fifth Third Bancorp 59 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Bancorp sold nearly all of its 15-year fixed-rate and adjustable-rate agency mortgage-backed securities and all of its U.S. Treasury notes to reduce its interest rate spread exposure in these asset classes. The Bancorp sold nearly all of its whole loan collateralized mortgage obligations and adjustable-rate mortgages and the majority of its agency collateralized mortgage obligations as these classes of securities are not widely accepted by the Bancorps customers as forms of collateral. The Bancorp sold all of its FNMA agency debentures to reduce its credit exposure as a result of recent market events. The Bancorp purchased approximately $1.4 billion in 30-year fixed-rate agency mortgage-backed securities and $1.4 billion of one-month and three-month U.S. Treasury bills for collateral purposes. During the third quarter of 2006, the Bancorp sold $726 million of FHLMC callable debt, which represented nearly all of its position in these securities, in order to manage its liquidity and reduce its credit exposure as a result of recent market events. The Bancorp believes it met its objective to reduce the size of its available-for-sale securities portfolio to a size that is more consistent with its liquidity, collateral and interest rate risk management requirements, improve the asset/liability profile of the Bancorp and better position the Bancorp for an uncertain economic and interest rate environment as a result of these actions. The Bancorp assesses its remaining securities relative to the same portfolio objective, its market outlook and its desired asset class allocations. Given this assessment, the Bancorp maintains its intent and ability to hold the remaining available-for-sale securities to the earlier of the recovery of the unrealized losses or maturity. The amortized cost and approximate fair value of securities at December 31, 2006, by contractual maturity, are shown in the following table. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities when there exists a right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

The Bancorp believes the price movements in these securities are dependent upon movements in market interest rates. At December 31, 2006, one percent of unrealized losses in the available-for-sale securities portfolio were represented by non-rated securities. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, securities with a fair value of $7.7 billion and $16.6 billion, respectively, were pledged to secure borrowings, public deposits, trust funds and for other purposes as required or permitted by law. Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities held at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 60 Fifth Third Bancorp NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3.

The total valuation allowance on the impaired loans at December 31, 2006 was $59 million. As of December 31, 2005, impaired loans with a valuation allowance totaled $147 million and impaired loans without a valuation allowance totaled $77 million. The total valuation allowance on the impaired loans at December 31, 2005 was $54 million. Average impaired loans, net of valuation allowances, were $209 million in 2006, $169 million in 2005 and $140 million in 2004. Cash basis interest income recognized on those loans during each of the years was immaterial. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, total nonperforming assets were $455 million and $361 million, respectively, and total loans and leases 90 days past due were $210 million and $155 million, respectively.

Occupancy expense for cancelable and noncancelable leases was $78 million for 2006, $68 million for 2005 and $57 million for 2004. Occupancy expense has been reduced by rental income from leased premises of $12 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Bancorps subsidiaries have entered into a number of noncancelable lease agreements with respect to bank premises and equipment. The minimum annual rental commitments under noncancelable lease agreements for land and buildings at December 31, 2006, exclusive of income taxes and other charges, are $72 million in 2007, $69 million in 2008, $64 million in 2009, $59 million in 2010, $53 million in 2011 and $377 million in 2012 and subsequent years. 5. GOODWILL Changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill by reporting segment for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: ($ in millions) Commercial Banking Branch Banking Consumer Lending Investment Advisors Processing Solutions Total Balance as of December 31, 2004 $373 254 58 103 191 979 Acquisition activity 498 544 124 24 - 1,190 Balance as of December 31, 2005 871 798 182 127 191 2,169 Acquisition activity - (1) - - 14 13 Reclassification - - - 11 - 11 Balance as of December 31, 2006 $871 797 182 138 205 2,193 The Bancorp completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2006 and determined that no impairment exists. In the table above, acquisition activity includes acquisitions in the respective period plus purchase accounting adjustments related to previous acquisitions. During 2006, the Bancorp acquired a credit card processing company. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $14 million of goodwill and did not have a material impact on the financial results of the Bancorp. Additionally, during 2006, $11 million of goodwill was reclassified from other intangible assets. 6. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets consist of core deposits, servicing rights, customer lists and non-competition agreements. Intangibles, excluding servicing rights, are amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives and have an estimated weighted-average life at December 31, 2006 of 3.3 years. The Bancorp reviews intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The details of the Bancorps intangible assets are shown in the following table. ($ in millions) Gross CarryingAmount AccumulatedAmortization ValuationAllowance Net CarryingAmount As of December 31, 2006: Mortgage servicing rights $1,210 (664) (27) 519 Other consumer and commercial servicing rights 23 (18) - 5 Core deposits 417 (276) - 141 Other 43 (18) - 25 Total intangible assets $1,693 (976) (27) 690 As of December 31, 2005: Mortgage servicing rights $1,075 (596) (46) 433 Other consumer and commercial servicing rights 22 (14) - 8 Core deposits 432 (244) - 188 Other 29 (9) - 20 Total intangible assets $1,558 (863) (46) 649 As of December 31, 2006, all of the Bancorps intangible assets were being amortized. Amortization expense recognized on intangible assets, including servicing rights, for 2006 and 2005 was $116 million and $125 million, respectively. Estimated amortization expense, including servicing rights, is $105 million in 2007, $92 million in 2008, $78 million in 2009, $66 million in 2010 and $11 million in 2011. 62 Fifth Third Bancorp NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 7.

The Bancorp serviced $28.7 billion and $25.7 billion of residential mortgage loans and $.5 billion and $.9 billion of consumer loans for other investors at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Changes in the servicing rights valuation allowance for the years ended December 31: ($ in millions) 2006 2005 Balance at January 1 $(46) (79) Servicing valuation recovery 19 33 Permanent impairment write-off - - Balance at December 31 $(27) (46) The volatility of longer-term interest rates during 2006 and 2005 and the resulting impact of changing prepayment speeds led to the recovery of $19 million and $33 million, respectively, in temporary impairment on the mortgage servicing rights (MSR) portfolio. Temporary impairment or impairment recovery, effected through a change in the MSR valuation reserve, are captured as a component of mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in value of the MSR portfolio. This strategy includes the purchase of free-standing derivatives (principal-only swaps, swaptions and interest rate swaps) and various available-for-sale securities (primarily principal-only strips). The interest income, mark-to-market adjustments and gain or loss from sale activities associated with these portfolios are expected to economically hedge a portion of the change in value of the MSR portfolio caused by fluctuating discount rates, earnings rates and prepayment speeds. The Bancorp recognized a net loss of $9 million and $23 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to changes in fair value and settlement of free-standing derivatives purchased to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. See Note 8 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the derivatives, including the notional amount and fair value, used to hedge the MSR portfolio. A gain of $3 million was recognized in 2006 on the sale of securities used to hedge the MSR portfolio. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the available-for-sale securities portfolio included $176 million and $197 million, respectively, in instruments related to the non-qualified hedging strategy. 8. DERIVATIVES The Bancorp maintains an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce certain risks related to interest rate, prepayment and foreign currency volatility. The Bancorps interest rate risk management strategy involves modifying the repricing characteristics of certain financial instruments so that changes in interest rates do not adversely affect the net interest margin and cash flows. Derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, options and swaptions. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest payments, such as fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments, based on a common notional amount and maturity date. Interest rate floors protect against declining rates, while interest rate caps protect against rising interest rates. Forward contracts are contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase, and the seller agrees to make delivery of, a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. Options provide the purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell a contracted item during a specified period at an agreed upon price. Swaptions are financial instruments granting the owner the right, but not the obligation, to enter into or cancel a swap. Prepayment volatility arises mostly from changes in fair value of the largely fixed-rate MSR portfolio, mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. The Bancorp may enter into various free-standing derivatives (principal-only swaps, swaptions, floors, options and interest rate swaps) to economically hedge prepayment volatility. Principal-only swaps are total return swaps based on changes in the value of the underlying mortgage principal-only trust. Foreign currency volatility occurs as the Bancorp enters into certain foreign denominated loans. Derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use to economically hedge these foreign denominated loans include foreign exchange swaps and forward contracts. The Bancorp also enters into derivative contracts (including foreign exchange contracts, commodity contracts and interest rate swaps, floors and caps) for the benefit of commercial customers. The Bancorp may economically hedge significant exposures related to these free-standing derivatives by entering into offsetting third-party contracts with approved, reputable counterparties with substantially matching terms and currencies. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Bancorps exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts rather than the notional, principal or contract amounts. The Bancorp minimizes the credit risk through credit approvals, limits, counterparty collateral and monitoring procedures. Fair Value Hedges The Bancorp may enter into interest rate swaps to convert its fixed-rate, long-term debt to floating-rate debt. Decisions to convert fixed-rate debt to floating are made primarily by consideration of the asset/liability mix of the Bancorp, the desired asset/liability sensitivity and interest rate levels. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, certain interest rate swaps met the criteria required to qualify for the shortcut method of accounting. Based on this shortcut method of accounting treatment, no ineffectiveness is assumed. For interest rate swaps that do not meet the shortcut requirements, an assessment of hedge effectiveness was performed and such swaps were accounted for using the long-haul method. The long-haul method requires periodic assessment of hedge effectiveness and measurement of ineffectiveness. The ineffectiveness results to the extent the changes in the fair value of derivative recorded does not offset changes in fair value of the debt due to changes in the hedged risk, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For interest rate swaps accounted for as a fair value hedge using the long-haul method, ineffectiveness is the difference between the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and changes in fair value of the long-term debt attributable to the risk being hedged. For interest rate swaps that do not qualify for the shortcut method of accounting, the ineffectiveness is reported within interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, changes in the fair value of any interest rate swaps attributed to hedge ineffectiveness were insignificant to the Bancorps Consolidated Statements of Income. Fifth Third Bancorp 63 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS During 2006 and 2005, the Bancorp terminated interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges and in accordance with SFAS No. 133, an amount equal to the cumulative fair value adjustment to the hedged items at the date of termination is amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining term of the long-term debt. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, $14 million in net deferred losses, net of tax, and $3 million in net deferred gains, net of tax, on the terminated fair value hedges were amortized into interest expense, respectively. The Bancorp also enters into forward contracts to hedge its residential mortgage loans held for sale. The hedged mortgage loans held for sale are grouped into portfolios of loans that share the same risk exposure. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Bancorp recognized a net loss of $5 million related to the ineffectiveness of the hedging relationships. Those forward contracts that do not meet the criteria for fair value hedge accounting are accounted for as free-standing derivatives. The following table reflects the notional amount and market value of all fair value hedges included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31: 2006 2005 ($ in millions) NotionalAmount FairValue NotionalAmount FairValue Included in other assets: Interest rate swaps related to debt $- $- 500 21 Forward contracts related to mortgage loans held for sale 653 4 61 - Total included in other assets $4 21 Included in other liabilities: Interest rate swaps related to debt $2,575 $95 3,095 103 Forward contracts related to mortgage loans held for sale 419 2 739 3 Total included in other liabilities $97 106 Cash Flow Hedges The Bancorp may enter into interest rate swaps to convert floating-rate assets and liabilities to fixed rates and to hedge certain forecasted transactions. The assets and liabilities are typically grouped and share the same risk exposure for which they are being hedged. The Bancorp may also enter into forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions. The Bancorp has no outstanding cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2006 or 2005. In prior periods, the Bancorp terminated certain derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges. The deferred gains or losses of those terminated instruments, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and are being amortized over the designated hedging periods, which range up to 4 months. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, less than $1 million and $13 million, respectively, in net deferred losses, net of tax, related to terminated cash flow hedges were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, $12 million and $14 million, respectively, in net deferred losses, net of tax, on the terminated cash flow hedges were amortized into net interest income. As of December 31, 2006, less than $1 million in net deferred losses, net of tax, on terminated cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified into net interest income during the next 12 months. Free-Standing Derivative Instruments The majority of the free-standing derivative instruments the Bancorp enters into are for the benefit of commercial customers. These derivative contracts are not designated against specific assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or to forecasted transactions and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments include foreign exchange derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of commercial customers involved in international trade to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, commodity contracts to hedge such items as natural gas and various other derivative contracts. The Bancorp may economically hedge significant exposures related to these derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of customers by entering into offsetting contracts with approved, reputable, independent counterparties with substantially matching terms. The Bancorp hedges its interest rate exposure on commercial customer transactions by executing offsetting swap agreements with primary dealers. Revaluation gains and losses on foreign exchange, commodity and other commercial customer derivative contracts are recorded as a component of corporate banking revenue. The Bancorp enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans. Derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use to economically hedge these foreign denominated loans include foreign exchange swaps and forward contracts. The Bancorp does not designate these instruments against the foreign denominated loans, and therefore, does not obtain hedge accounting treatment. Revaluation gains and losses on such foreign currency derivative contracts are recorded within other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income as are revaluation gains and losses on foreign denominated loans. As part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity, the Bancorp may enter into various free-standing derivatives (principal-only swaps, swaptions, floors, options and interest rate swaps) to economically hedge changes in fair value of its largely fixed-rate MSR portfolio. Principal-only swaps hedge the mortgage-LIBOR spread because they appreciate in value as a result of tightening spreads. They also provide prepayment protection by increasing in value when prepayment speeds increase, as opposed to MSRs that lose value in a faster prepayment environment. Receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps and swaptions increase in value when interest rates do not increase as quickly as expected. The Bancorp enters into forward contracts to economically hedge the change in fair value of certain residential mortgage loans held for sale due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate lock commitments issued on residential mortgage loan commitments that will be held for resale are also considered free-standing derivative instruments and the interest rate exposure on these commitments is economically hedged primarily with forward contracts. Revaluation gains and losses from free-standing derivatives related to mortgage banking activity are recorded as a component of mortgage banking net revenue. Additionally, the Bancorp occasionally may enter into free-standing derivative instruments (options, swaptions and interest rate swaps) in order to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility. Revaluation gains and losses on interest rate risk derivative contracts are recorded within other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 64 Fifth Third Bancorp NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The net gains (losses) recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income relating to free-standing derivative instruments for the years ended December 31 are summarized in the table below: ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Foreign exchange contracts $56 52 45 Forward contracts related to interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale 7 (2) (3) Interest rate lock commitments (2) 1 4 Derivative instruments related to MSR portfolio (9) (23) (10) Derivative instruments related to interest rate risk (20) 3 7 The following table reflects the market value of all free-standing derivatives included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31: 2006 2005 ($ in millions) NotionalAmount Fair Value NotionalAmount Fair Value Included in other assets: Foreign exchange contracts for customers $5,064 $164 3,771 118 Interest rate contracts for customers 8,174 110 5,964 48 Commodity contracts for customers 68 4 - - Foreign exchange contracts 68 1 - - Derivative instruments related to MSR portfolio 2,335 14 560 4 Interest rate lock commitments 389 2 315 1 Forward contracts related to interest rate lock commitments 243 1 71 - Derivative instruments related to interest rate risk 213 9 - - Total included in other assets $305 171 Included in other liabilities: Foreign exchange contracts for customers $4,783 $149 3,654 104 Interest rate contracts for customers 8,398 110 5,924 48 Commodity contracts for customers 62 4 - - Derivative instruments related to MSR portfolio 583 5 586 10 Interest rate lock commitments 750 3 165 - Forward contracts related to interest rate lock commitments 103 1 416 1 Derivative instruments related to interest rate risk 7 - - - Total included in other liabilities $272 163 The following table summarizes the Bancorps derivative instrument positions (excluding $27.6 billion in notional amount from the customer accommodation program) at December 31, 2006: ($ in millions) Notional Amount Weighted-AverageRemaining Maturity (in months) Average Receive Rate Average Pay Rate Interest rate swaps related to debt: Receive fixed/pay floating $2,775 107 4.85 % 5.43 % Mortgage lending commitments: Forward contracts on mortgage loans held for sale and interest rate lock commitments 1,418 1 Mortgage servicing rights portfolio: Principal-only swaps 48 2 4.23 Interest rate swaps  Receive fixed/pay floating 785 62 5.12 5.37 Interest rate swaps  Receive floating/pay fixed 460 86 5.36 4.95 Interest rate swaptions  Receive fixed 1,225 5 4.86 Interest rate swaptions  Pay fixed 400 3 5.28 Foreign currency: Forward contracts 15 2 Swaps 53 2 Interest rate futures/forwards 20 2 Total $7,199 Fifth Third Bancorp 65 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 9.

These notes currently pay interest at one-month LIBOR and, in 2007, can be extended for twelve months to pay interest at one-month LIBOR plus 1 bp. In 2008, the notes can be extended an additional twelve months paying an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2 bp. The final maturity of these notes is 2009. The subordinated fixed-rate notes due in 2017 and 2018 are the obligation of the Bancorp. The Bancorp entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed-rate notes to floating-rate. The rate paid on these swaps was 5.37% at December 31, 2006. The subordinated floating-rate notes due in 2016 are obligations of the Bancorp. The notes pay interest at three-month LIBOR plus 42 bp. The Bancorp issued the 8.136% junior subordinated debentures due in 2027 to Fifth Third Capital Trust I (FTCT1). The Bancorp has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of FTCT1s obligations under trust preferred securities issued by FTCT1. The Bancorp entered into a swap to convert the fixed-rate debt into floating. The interest rate paid on the swap was 5.86% at December 31, 2006. The trust preferred securities have been called in the first quarter of 2007. The three-month LIBOR plus 80 bp junior subordinated debentures due in 2027 were issued to Old Kent Capital Trust 1 (OKCT1). The Bancorp has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of OKCT1s obligations under trust preferred securities issued by OKCT1. The trust preferred securities were redeemed in the first quarter of 2007. The three-month LIBOR plus 290 bp and the three-month LIBOR plus 279 bp junior subordinated debentures due in 2033 and 2034, respectively, were assumed by a subsidiary of the Bancorp in connection with the acquisition of First National. The obligations were issued to FNB Statutory Trusts I and II (STAT I and STAT II), respectively. The Bancorp has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all obligations of STAT I and STAT II under trust preferred securities issued by STAT I and STAT II, respectively. The senior fixed-rate bank notes due from 2007 to 2019 are the obligations of a subsidiary bank. The maturities of the face value of the senior fixed-rate bank notes are as follows: $375 million in 2007, $500 million in 2008, $109 million in 2009, $800 million in 2010 and $275 million in 2019. The Bancorp entered into swaps to convert $1.1 billion of the fixed-rate debt into floating. At December 31, 2006, the rates paid on these swaps ranged from 5.37% to 5.41%. The subordinated fixed-rate bank notes due in 2015 are the obligations of a subsidiary bank. The Bancorp entered into swaps to convert the fixed-rate debt into floating. At December 31, 2006, the rate paid on the swaps ranged from 5.34% to 5.60%. The mandatorily redeemable securities due 2031 relate to a preferred stock obligation of a subsidiary of the Bancorp. The preferred stock will be automatically exchanged for trust preferred securities in 2031. Beginning five years from the date of issuance, the Bancorps subsidiary has the option, subject to regulatory approval, to exchange the preferred stock for trust preferred securities or cash upon a change in the Bancorps senior debt rating to or below BBB, a change in the investors tax elections or a change to applicable tax law. At December 31, 2006, FHLB advances have rates ranging from 0% to 8.34%, with interest payable monthly.

Fifth Third Bancorp 67 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The Bancorp, in the normal course of business, uses derivatives and other financial instruments to manage its interest rate risks and prepayment risks and to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments primarily include commitments to extend credit, standby and commercial letters of credit, foreign exchange contracts, commitments to sell residential mortgage loans, principal-only swaps, interest rate swap agreements, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, commodities contracts, written options and interest rate lock commitments. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk, counterparty risk and market risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Bancorps Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2006, all of the Bancorps risk management derivatives exposure was to investment grade companies. The contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Bancorp has in particular classes of financial instruments. Creditworthiness for all instruments is evaluated on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the Bancorps credit policies. While notional amounts are typically used to express the volume of these transactions, it does not represent the much smaller amounts that are potentially subject to credit risk. Entering into derivative instruments involves the risk of dealing with counterparties and their ability to meet the terms of the contract. The Bancorp controls the credit risk of these transactions through adherence to a derivatives products policy, credit approval policies and monitoring procedures. Collateral, if deemed necessary, is based on managements credit evaluation of the counterparty and may include business assets of commercial borrowers, as well as personal property and real estate of individual borrowers and guarantors. A summary of significant commitments and contingent liabilities at December 31: Contract or NotionalAmount ($ in millions) 2006 2005 Commitments to extend credit $ 42,085 35,724 Letters of credit (including standby letters of credit) 8,163 7,300 Customer derivatives in a gain position 3,911 2,410 Forward contracts to sell mortgage loans 1,418 1,285 Noncancelable lease obligations 695 609 Purchase obligations 24 34 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend, typically having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements. The Bancorp is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance for the amount of the contract. Fixed-rate commitments are also subject to market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and the Bancorps exposure is limited to the replacement value of those commitments. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Bancorp had a reserve for probable credit losses totaling $75 million and $69 million, respectively, included in other liabilities. Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. At December 31, 2006, approximately $2.9 billion of standby letters of credit expire within one year, $4.8 billion expire between one to five years and $.5 billion expire thereafter. At December 31, 2006, letters of credit of approximately $32 million were issued to commercial customers for a duration of one year or less to facilitate trade payments in domestic and foreign currency transactions. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the reserve related to these standby letters of credit was less than $1 million. Approximately 69% of the total standby letters of credit were secured as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. In the event of nonperformance by the customers, the Bancorp has rights to the underlying collateral, which can include commercial real estate, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and marketable securities. As discussed in Note 8, the Bancorps policy is to enter into derivative contracts to accommodate customers, to offset customer accommodations and to offset its own market risk incurred in the ordinary course of its business. Contingent obligations arising from market risk assumed in derivatives are offset with additional rights contained in other derivatives or contracts, such as loans or borrowings. A liability arises when a customer does not perform according to the derivative contract while the Bancorp must perform the offsetting agreement. Customer derivatives in a gain position with a corresponding offset are included in the table. The fair value of these contracts at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $45 million and $31 million, respectively. The Bancorps subsidiaries have entered into a number of noncancelable lease agreements. The minimum rental commitments under noncancelable lease agreements are shown in the table. The Bancorp has also entered into a limited number of agreements for work related to banking center construction and to purchase goods or services. There are claims pending against the Bancorp and its subsidiaries that have arisen in the normal course of business. See Note 13 for additional information regarding these proceedings. 13. LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS During May 2005, the Bancorp filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio related to a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service concerning the timing of deductions associated with certain leveraged lease transactions in its 1997 tax return. The Internal Revenue Service has also proposed adjustments to the tax effects of certain leveraged lease transactions in subsequent tax return years. The proposed adjustments, including penalties, relate to the Bancorps portfolio of lease-in lease-out transactions, service contract leases and qualified technology equipment leases with both domestic and foreign municipalities. The Bancorp is challenging the Internal Revenue Services proposed treatment of all of these leasing transactions. The Bancorps original net investment in these leases totaled approximately $900 million. The Bancorp continues to believe that its treatment of these leveraged leases was appropriate and in compliance with applicable tax law and regulations. While management cannot predict with certainty the result of the suit, given the tax treatment of these transactions has been challenged by the Internal Revenue Service, the Bancorp believes a resolution may involve a projected change in the timing of the leveraged lease cash flows. Recently issued FSP FAS 13-2, which is effective as of January 1, 2007, mandates that a change or projected change in the timing of lessor cash flows related to income taxes generated by leveraged lease transactions, excluding interest and penalty assessments, will require a lessor to recalculate the rate of return and allocation of income to positive investment years from inception of the lease. Upon adoption of FSP FAS 13-2 on January 1, 2007, the Bancorp recorded a $96 million after-tax charge to retained earnings related to its portfolio of leveraged leases. The amount of this reduction will be recognized as income over the remaining term of the affected leases. In January 2007, the Bancorp made a $356 million deposit with the IRS to mitigate the risk associated with tax years after 1997 and, in particular, the leveraged lease transactions noted above. The deposit enables the 68 Fifth Third Bancorp NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Bancorp to stop the accrual of interest at a current rate of 8-10% on any tax deficiency to the extent of the deposit if the Bancorp is not ultimately successful in its suit. On April 26, 2006 the Bancorp was added as a defendant in a consolidated antitrust class action lawsuit originally filed against Visa®, MasterCard® and several other major financial institutions in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiffs, merchants operating commercial businesses throughout the U.S. and trade associations, claim that the interchange fees charged by card-issuing banks are unreasonable and seek injunctive relief and unspecified damages. As this litigation is still in its early stages, it is not possible for management to assess the probability of a material adverse outcome or the range of possible damages to the Bancorp, if any. As an outgrowth of the recent SEC consent order involving BISYS Fund Services, Inc. (BISYS), which has provided certain administrative services to the Fifth Third Funds, Fifth Third Asset Management, Inc. (FTAM), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bancorp, has received an informal request for information from the SEC regarding its past dealings with BISYS. FTAM is responding to the SECs requests and intends to cooperate with the SEC in this review. The impact to the Bancorp of the final disposition of this inquiry cannot be assessed at this time. Several putative class action complaints have been filed against the Bancorp in various federal courts and one state court. The Bancorp has filed to remove the state court action to federal court. The complaints relate to an alleged intrusion of The TJX Companies, Inc.s (TJX) computer system and the potential theft of their customers non-public personal information and alleged violations of the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act. Some of the complaints were filed by consumers and seek unquantified damages on behalf of putative classes of persons who transacted business at any one of TJXs stores during the period of May 2006 through December 2006. Another was filed by a bank and seeks unquantified damages on behalf of other similarly situated entities that suffered losses in relation to the alleged intrusion. Management believes there are substantial defenses to these claims and intends to defend them vigorously. The impact of the final disposition of these lawsuits cannot be assessed at this time. The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are not parties to any other material litigation. However, there are other litigation matters which arise in the normal course of business. While it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability with respect to these contingent matters, management believes any resulting liability from these other actions would not have a material effect upon the Bancorps consolidated financial position or results of operations or cash flows. 14. GUARANTEES The Bancorp has performance obligations upon the occurrence of certain events under financial guarantees provided in certain contractual arrangements. These various arrangements are summarized below. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Bancorp had issued $8.1 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively, of financial and performance standby letters of credit to guarantee the performance of various customers to third parties. The maximum amount of credit risk in the event of nonperformance by these parties is equivalent to the contract amount and totals $8.1 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively. Upon issuance, the Bancorp recognizes a liability equal to the amount of fees received from the customer for these standby letter of credit commitments. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the reserve related to these standby letters of credit was less than $1 million. Approximately 69% of the total standby letters of credit were secured as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. In the event of nonperformance by the customers, the Bancorp has rights to the underlying collateral, which can include commercial real estate, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and marketable securities. Through December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Bancorp had transferred, subject to credit recourse, certain primarily floating-rate, short-term investment grade commercial loans to an unconsolidated qualified special purpose entity (QSPE) that is wholly owned by an independent third-party. The outstanding balance of such loans at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $3.4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. These loans may be transferred back to the Bancorp upon the occurrence of certain specified events. These events include borrower default on the loans transferred, bankruptcy preferences initiated against underlying borrowers and ineligible loans transferred by the Bancorp to the QSPE. The maximum amount of credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the underlying borrowers is approximately equivalent to the total outstanding balance of $3.4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2006 and 2005. In addition, the Bancorps agreement to provide liquidity support to the QSPE was $3.8 billion as of year end 2006 compared to $3.4 billion as of year end 2005. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Bancorps loss reserve related to the liquidity support and credit enhancement provided to the QSPE was $16 million and $10 million, respectively, recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Bancorp had provided credit recourse on approximately $1.3 billion of residential mortgage loans sold to unrelated third parties. In the event of any customer default, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, the Bancorp is required to reimburse the third party. The maximum amount of credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the underlying borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance. In the event of nonperformance, the Bancorp has rights to the underlying collateral value attached to the loan. The Bancorp maintained an estimated credit loss reserve of approximately $18 million and $21 million relating to these residential mortgage loans sold at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. To determine the credit loss reserve, the Bancorp used an approach that is consistent with its overall approach in estimating credit losses for various categories of residential mortgage loans held in its loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Bancorp had fully and unconditionally guaranteed $376 million of certain long-term borrowing obligations issued by four wholly-owned issuing trust entities. The Bancorp, through its electronic payment processing division, processes VISA® and MasterCard® merchant card transactions. Pursuant to VISA® and MasterCard® rules, the Bancorp assumes certain contingent liabilities relating to these transactions which typically arise from billing disputes between the merchant and cardholder that are ultimately resolved in the cardholders favor. In such cases, these transactions are charged back to the merchant and disputed amounts are refunded to the cardholder. If the Bancorp is unable to collect these amounts from the merchant, it will bear the loss for refunded amounts. The likelihood of incurring a contingent liability arising from chargebacks is relatively low, as most products or services are delivered when purchased and credits are issued on returned items. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Bancorp processed approximately $120 million and $100 million, respectively, of chargebacks presented by issuing banks, resulting in no material actual losses to the Bancorp. The Bancorp accrues for probable losses based on historical experience and did not carry a credit loss reserve at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Fifth Third Securities, Inc (FTS), a subsidiary of the Bancorp, guarantees the collection of all margin account balances Fifth Third Bancorp 69 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS held by its brokerage clearing agent for the benefit of FTS customers. FTS is responsible for payment to its brokerage clearing agent for any loss, liability, damage, cost or expense incurred as a result of customers failing to comply with margin or margin maintenance calls on all margin accounts. The margin account balance held by the brokerage clearing agent as of December 31, 2006 was $51 million compared to $55 million as of December 31, 2005. In the event of any customer default, FTS has rights to the underlying collateral provided. Given the existence of the underlying collateral provided and negligible historical credit losses, FTS does not maintain a loss reserve. 15. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS At December 31, 2006 and 2005, certain directors, executive officers, principal holders of Bancorp common stock, associates of such persons, and affiliated companies of such persons were indebted, including undrawn commitments to lend, to the Bancorps banking subsidiaries in the aggregate amount, net of participations, of $271 million and $307 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the outstanding balance on loans to related parties, net of participations and undrawn commitments, was $76 million and $81 million, respectively. Commitments to lend to related parties as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, net of participations, were comprised of $260 million and $296 million, respectively, to directors and $11 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005 to executive officers. The commitments are in the form of loans and guarantees for various business and personal interests. This indebtedness was incurred in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time of comparable transactions with unrelated parties. This indebtedness does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. None of the Bancorps affiliates, officers, directors or employees has an interest in or receives any remuneration from any special purpose entities or qualified special purpose entities with which the Bancorp transacts business. The Bancorp maintains a written policy and procedures covering related party transactions. These procedures cover transactions such as employee-stock purchase loans, personal lines of credit, residential secured loans, overdrafts, letters of credit and increases in indebtedness. Such transactions are subject to the Bancorps normal underwriting and approval procedures. Prior to the loan closing, Compliance Risk Management must approve and determine whether the transaction requires approval from or a post notification be sent to the Bancorps Board of Directors. 16. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME The Bancorp has elected to present the disclosures required by SFAS No. 130, Reporting of Comprehensive Income, in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders Equity and in the table below. The Bancorp adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). This statement requires companies to recognize the unamortized actuarial net gains or losses and unamortized prior service costs as components of accumulated other comprehensive income.

COMMON STOCK AND TREASURY STOCK The following is a summary of the share activity within common stock issued and treasury stock for the years ended December 31: Common Stock Treasury Stock ($ and shares in millions) Value Shares Value Shares Shares at December 31, 2003 $1,295 583 $962 17 Shares acquired for treasury - - 987 19 Stock-based awards exercised, including treasury shares issued - - (222) (4) Restricted stock grants - - (33) (1) Shares issued in business combinations - - (281) (5) Other - - 1 - Shares at December 31, 2004 1,295 583 1,414 26 Shares acquired for treasury - - 1,746 38 Stock-based awards exercised, including treasury shares issued - - (206) (4) Restricted stock grants - - (43) (1) Shares issued in business combinations 11 5 (1,413) (26) Retirement of shares (11) (5) (219) (5) Shares at December 31, 2005 1,295 583 1,279 28 Shares acquired for treasury - - 82 2 Stock-based awards exercised, including treasury shares issued - - (84) (2) Restricted stock grants - - (45) (1) Shares at December 31, 2006 $1,295 583 $1,232 27 During 2004, the Bancorp repurchased approximately 18 million shares of its common stock, approximately three percent of total outstanding shares, for $987 million. On January 10, 2005, the Bancorp executed an overnight share repurchase transaction with a counterparty for the acquisition of 35.5 million shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $45.95 per share, or $1.6 billion. Pursuant to the agreement with the counterparty, the counterparty purchased 35.5 million shares in the open market over a period of time that was completed during the third quarter of 2005. In accordance with EITF Issue 99-7 Accounting for an Accelerated Share Repurchase Program, the share transaction was considered two separate transactions, (i) the acquisition of treasury shares on the acquisition date and (ii) a forward contract indexed to the Bancorps stock. The treasury shares were accounted for at cost as a contra equity transaction. The forward contract associated with the overnight share repurchase transaction was accounted for in accordance with EITF 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own Stock, as an equity instrument. At the end of the purchase period, the Bancorp received a cash payment of $97 million for the purchase price adjustment based on the volume weighted average purchase price of $43.55. The payment received in connection with the price adjustment was recorded as an addition to capital surplus. Additionally, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the Bancorp assumed the transaction would be net settled in shares as the Bancorp had the choice of settling in cash or shares and the Bancorp did not have a stated policy or the ability to demonstrate a past practice of cash settlement. These incremental shares were subsequently excluded from quarterly earnings per share calculations, as the effect of inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. On January 18, 2005, the Bancorp announced that its Board of Directors had authorized management to purchase 20 million shares of the Bancorps common stock through the open market or in any private transaction. The timing of the purchases and the exact number of shares to be purchased depends upon market conditions. The authorization does not include specific price targets or an expiration date. The Bancorps stock repurchase program is an important element of its capital planning activities and the Bancorp views share repurchases as an effective means of delivering value to shareholders. During 2006, the Bancorp repurchased approximately 2 million shares of its common stock, less than one percent of total outstanding shares, for $82 million. At December 31, 2006, approximately 15.8 million shares remain authorized for repurchase. Fifth Third Bancorp 71 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 18. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Bancorp has historically emphasized employee stock ownership. Based on total stock-based awards outstanding and shares remaining for future grants under the Incentive Compensation Plan, the Bancorps total overhang is approximately nine percent. The following table provides detail of the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of outstanding stock-based awards and remaining shares available for future issuance under all of the Bancorps equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2006: Plan Category (shares in thousands) Number of Sharesto Be Issued UponExercise Weighted-AverageExercise Price Shares Availablefor Future Issuance(a) Equity compensation plans approved by shareholders Stock options 24,456 $49.08 (b) Restricted stock 2,380 (c) (b) Performance units (d) (c) (b) Stock appreciation rights (SARs) (e) (e) (b) Equity compensation plans not approved by shareholders Employee stock purchase plan 1,613(f) Total (g) 26,836 $49.08 13,748(h) (a) Excludes shares to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options. (b) Under the Incentive Compensation Plan, 20.0 million shares of stock were authorized for issuance as nonqualified and incentive stock options, SARs, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units and stock awards. As of December 31, 2006, 11.9 million shares remain available for future issuance. (c) Not applicable (d) The number of shares to be issued is dependent upon the Bancorp achieving certain predefined performance targets and ranges from zero shares to approximately 293 thousand shares, dependent on relative performance. (e) At December 31, 2006, approximately 13.1 million SARs were outstanding at a weighted-average grant price of $43.43. The number of shares to be issued upon exercise will be determined at vesting based on the difference between the grant price and the market price at the date of exercise. (f) Represents remaining shares of Fifth Third common stock under the Bancorps 1993 Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and restated, including an additional 1,500,000 shares approved by shareholders on March 28, 2006. (g) Excludes 2.4 million outstanding options awarded under plans assumed by the Bancorp in connection with certain mergers and acquisitions. The Bancorp has not made any awards under these plans and will make no additional awards under these plans. The weighted-average exercise price of the outstanding options is $32.63 per share. (h) Includes .3 million shares issuable relating to deferred stock compensation plans. Stock-based awards are eligible for issuance under the Bancorps Incentive Compensation Plan to key employees and directors of the Bancorp and its subsidiaries. The Incentive Compensation Plan was approved by shareholders on March 23, 2004. The plan authorized the issuance of up to 20 million shares as equity compensation and provides for nonqualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units and stock awards. Stock options and SARs are issued at fair market value based on the closing price on the date of grant, have up to ten-year terms and vest and become fully exercisable at the end of three to four years of continued employment. Currently, all SARs outstanding are to be settled with stock. Restricted stock grants vest either after four years or ratably after three, four and five years of continued employment and include dividend and voting rights. As discussed in Note 1, effective January 1, 2006, the Bancorp adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified retrospective application basis in accounting for stock-based compensation plans. Under SFAS No. 123(R), the Bancorp recognizes compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation issued over its requisite service period. Awards with a graded vesting are expensed on a straight-line basis. The grant-date fair value of stock options is measured using the Black- Scholes option-pricing model. The Bancorp uses the following assumptions, which are evaluated and revised as necessary, in estimating the grant-date fair value of each option grant for the year ended: 2006 2005 2004 Expected option life (in years) 6 6 6 Expected volatility 23% 26% 28% Expected dividend yield 4.1% 3.5% 2.3% Risk-free interest rate 4.9% 4.3% 3.9% The expected option life is derived from historical exercise patterns and represents the amount of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected volatility is based on a combination of historical and implied volatilities of the Bancorps stock. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Stock-based compensation expense was $76 million, $65 million and $87 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The total related income tax benefit recognized was $23 million, $16 million and $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The following tables include a summary of stock-based compensation transactions for the previous three fiscal years: 2006 2005 2004 Stock Options (shares in thousands) Shares Weighted-Average Option Price Shares Weighted-Average Option Price Shares Weighted-Average Option Price Outstanding at January 1 31,546 $46.49 36,162 $45.31 40,727 $44.40 Granted (a) - - 2,515 22.90 1,105 19.81 Exercised (1,931) 21.70 (4,830) 21.16 (4,248) 25.41 Forfeited or expired (2,715) 53.24 (2,301) 54.30 (1,422) 58.07 Outstanding at December 31 26,900 $47.58 31,546 $46.49 36,162 $45.31 Exercisable at December 31 25,978 $47.43 29,364 $46.01 30,912 $43.57 (a) 2005 stock options granted include 2,514 options assumed as part of the First National acquisition completed on January 1, 2006. These options were granted under a First National plan assumed by the Bancorp. 2004 options granted include 1,021 options assumed as part of the Franklin Financial acquisition completed on June 11, 2004. These stock options were granted under a Franklin Financial plan assumed by the Bancorp. 72 Fifth Third Bancorp NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS There were no stock options granted during 2006. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted for the years ended 2005 and 2004 was $20.54 and $36.57 per share, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $32 million, $103 million and $121 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash received from options exercised was $35 million, $90 million and $105 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized from the exercised options was $9 million, $28 million and $21 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The total grant-date fair value of stock options that vested during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $25 million, $78 million and $104 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, there was $7 million of compensation expense related to non-vested stock options not yet recognized. The expense is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of approximately 2.1 years. 2006 2005 2004 Stock Appreciation Rights (shares in thousands) Shares Weighted-Average Grant Price Shares Weighted-Average Grant Price Shares Weighted-Average Grant Price Outstanding at January 1 7,541 $47.51 3,529 $54.37 - $- Granted 6,949 39.18 4,892 42.82 3,716 54.37 Exercised - - - - - - Forfeited or expired (1,437) 44.31 (880) 48.88 (187) 54.40 Outstanding at December 31 13,053 $43.43 7,541 $47.51 3,529 $54.37 Exercisable at December 31 989 $42.99 4 $54.37 1 $54.40 The weighted-average grant-date fair value of SARs granted was $7.35, $9.31 and $14.11 per share for the years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The total grant-date fair value of SARs that vested during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $10 million, $.05 million and $.01 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, there was $52 million of compensation expense related to non-vested SARs not yet recognized. The expense is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years. 2006 2005 2004 Restricted Stock (shares in thousands) Shares Weighted-AverageGrant-DateFair Value Shares Weighted-AverageGrant-DateFair Value Shares Weighted-AverageGrant-DateFair Value Nonvested at January 1 1,482 $46.16 596 $54.01 48 $58.11 Granted 1,265 38.93 1,086 42.31 607 53.86 Vested (24) 44.91 (29) 50.62 (18) 59.16 Forfeited (343) 40.76 (171) 48.19 (41) 54.26 Nonvested at December 31 2,380 $40.28 1,482 $46.16 596 $54.01 The total grant-date fair value of restricted stock that vested during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $1.1 million, $1.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, there was $43 million of compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock not yet recognized. The expense is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years. The Bancorp has no specific policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options; however, the Bancorp has historically made adequate discretionary purchases based on cash availability, market trends and other factors, to satisfy stock option exercise activity. At December 31, 2006, there were 9.7 million incentive options, 17.2 million non-qualified options, 13.1 million SARs and 2.4 million restricted stock awards outstanding, ..3 million shares reserved for performance unit awards and 11.9 million shares available for grant. As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate intrinsic value of both outstanding options and exercisable options was $64 million. Stock options, SARs and restricted stock outstanding represent eight percent of the Bancorps issued shares at December 31, 2006.

These awards are payable in stock and cash contingent upon the Bancorp achieving certain predefined performance targets over the three-year measurement period. These performance targets are based on the Bancorps performance relative to a defined peer group. The performance-based awards were granted at a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $39.14 per share. The Bancorp sponsors a Stock Purchase Plan that allows qualifying employees to purchase shares of the Bancorps common stock with a 15% match. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, there were 317,483, 333,472 and 236,115 shares purchased by participants and the Bancorp recognized compensation expense of $2 million for each of the years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004.

SALES AND TRANSFERS OF LOANS The Bancorp sold fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans and student loans during 2006 and 2005. The Bancorp also securitized and sold certain automotive loans in 2004 and securitized and sold certain home equity lines of credit in 2003. In all of those sales, the Bancorp retained servicing responsibilities. In addition, the Bancorp retained a residual interest and an interest only strip (IO strip) in the home equity lines of credit securitization and a residual interest and subordinated tranche in the automotive loans securitization. The Bancorp receives annual servicing fees at a percentage of the outstanding balance and rights to future cash flows arising after the investors in the securitization trusts have received the return for which they contracted. The investors and the securitization trusts have no recourse to the Bancorps other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. The Bancorps retained interests are subordinate to investors interests. Their value is subject to credit, prepayment and interest rate risks on the sold financial assets. In 2006 and 2005, the Bancorp recognized pretax gains of $81 million and $123 million, respectively, on the sales of residential mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit and student loans. Total proceeds from the loan sales in 2006 and 2005 were $9.4 billion and $9.7 billion, respectively. Initial carrying values of retained interests recognized during 2006 and 2005 were as follows: ($ in millions) 2006 2005 Mortgage servicing assets $ 135 134 Other consumer and commercial servicing assets 1 1 Consumer residual interests - 5 Key economic assumptions used in measuring the Bancorps servicing rights and residual interests during 2006 and 2005 were as follows: 2006 2005 Rate Weighted-AverageLife (in years) PrepaymentSpeedAssumption DiscountRate Weighted-AverageDefaultRate Weighted-AverageLife (in years) PrepaymentSpeedAssumption DiscountRate Weighted-AverageDefaultRate Residential mortgage loans: Servicing assets Fixed 6.8 13.7 % 10.4 % N/A 7.1 12.6 % 10.3 % N/A Servicing assets Adjustable 2.7 38.6 11.7 N/A 3.7 27.5 11.6 N/A Home equity lines of credit:: Servicing assets Adjustable 1.8 37.5 11.7 N/A 2.4 35 11.7 N/A Residual interest Adjustable 1.6 37.5 11.7 .35 % 2.0 35 11.7 .35 % Based on historical credit experience, expected credit losses for servicing rights have been deemed immaterial.

As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on a 10% variation in assumptions typically cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in the previous table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption; in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses), which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities. In addition to the retained interests listed previously, the Bancorp retains certain investment grade securities from securitizations. The fair value of these retained securities was $15 million and $30 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The securities are valued using quoted market prices. The following table provides a summary of the total loans and leases managed by the Bancorp, including loans securitized for the years ended December 31: Balance Balance of Loans 90 Days orMore Past Due Net Credit Losses ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 Commercial loans $20,725 19,299 $38 20 $107 75 Commercial mortgage 10,405 9,188 17 8 24 9 Commercial leases 3,841 3,698 2 1 (1) 37 Construction loans 6,847 7,037 18 11 8 4 Residential mortgage 9,263 8,353 57 49 22 19 Other consumer loans 23,905 22,987 79 65 154 147 Consumer leases 1,073 1,595 2 3 5 14 Total loans and leases managed and securitized (a) 76,059 72,157 $213 157 $319 305 Less: Loans securitized 556 928 Loans held for sale 1,150 1,304 Total portfolio loans and leases $74,353 69,925 (a) Excluding securitized assets that the Bancorp continues to service but with which it has no other continuing involvement. Static pool credit losses are calculated by aggregating the actual and projected future credit losses for a securitization and dividing these losses by the original balance in each pool of assets. For the home equity lines of credit securitized in 2003, the static pool credit losses were .80% and .70% as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For the automotive loans securitized in 2004, the static pool credit losses were 1.09% and 1.00% as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During 2006 and 2005, the Bancorp transferred, subject to credit recourse, certain primarily floating-rate, short-term, investment grade commercial loans to an unconsolidated QSPE that is wholly owned by an independent third-party. Generally, the loans transferred provide a lower yield due to their investment grade nature, and therefore transferring these loans to the QSPE allows the Bancorp to reduce its exposure to these lower yielding loan assets while maintaining the customer relationships. The Bancorp retains servicing and receives monthly servicing fees. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the outstanding balance of loans transferred was $3.4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. These loans may be transferred back to the Bancorp upon the occurrence of an event specified in the legal documents that established the QSPE. These events include borrower default on the loans transferred, bankruptcy preferences initiated against underlying borrowers and ineligible loans transferred by the Bancorp to the QSPE. These commercial loans are transferred at par with no gain or loss recognized. The Bancorp receives rights to future cash flows arising after the investors in the securitization trust have received the return for which they contracted. No value has been assigned to this retained future stream of fees to be received as the fair value of this right was deemed immaterial due to the short-term servicing period of the assets transferred and the small spread provided by the transferred loans. As of December 31, 2006, the $3.4 billion balance of outstanding loans had a weighted-average remaining maturity of 2.7 years. During 2004, the Bancorp securitized and sold $750 million in automotive loans to an unconsolidated QSPE that is wholly owned by an independent third party. The Bancorp retained servicing rights and receives a servicing fee based on a percentage of the outstanding balance. Additionally, the Bancorp retained a subordinated tranche of securities and rights to future cash flows arising after investors in the securitization trust have received the return for which they contracted. The investors and the securitization trust have no recourse to the Bancorps other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. The Bancorps retained interest is subordinate to investors interests and its value is subject to credit, prepayment and interest rate risks on the sold automotive loans. As of December 31, 2006, the remaining balance of sold automotive loans was $146 million. During 2003, the Bancorp securitized and sold $903 million in home equity lines of credit to an unconsolidated QSPE that is wholly owned by an independent third party. The Bancorp retained servicing rights and receives a servicing fee based on a percentage of the outstanding balance. Additionally, the Bancorp retained rights to future cash flows arising after investors in the securitization trust have received the return for which they contracted. The investors and the securitization trust have no recourse to the Bancorps other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. The Bancorps retained interest is subordinate to investors interests and its value is subject to credit, prepayment and interest rate risks on the sold home equity lines of credit. During 2006, pursuant to the terms of the sales and servicing agreement, $39 million in fixed-rate home equity line of credit balances were put back to the Bancorp. As of December 31, 2006, the remaining balance of sold home equity lines of credit was $374 million.

As a result, the Bancorp recognized the overfunded and unfunded projected benefit obligation of its pension plans as an asset and liability, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006. Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income consist of: ($ in millions) 2006 Net actuarial loss $89 Net prior service cost 3 Total $92 The Bancorp implemented SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88 106, and 132(R) at December 31, 2006. SFAS No. 158 requires the funded status of pension plans to be recorded in the balance sheet as an asset for plans with an overfunded status and a liability for plans with an underfunded status. The Bancorp recognized the overfunded and underfunded status of its pension plans as an asset and liability, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006. The Bancorps qualified defined benefit plan is currently overfunded. This plans benefits were frozen in 1998, except for grandfathered employees. The Bancorps retirement plans with an underfunded status are nonqualified, supplemental retirement plans, which are funded on an as needed basis. A majority of these plans were obtained in acquisitions from prior years. The following table summarizes the incremental effect of applying SFAS No. 158 on individual line items in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006: ($ in millions) BeforeApplicationof SFASNo. 158 Adjustment AfterApplicationof SFASNo. 158 Financial statement line item: Prepaid benefit cost $ 124 (85 ) 39 Deferred tax asset 3 30 33 Total assets 127 (55 ) 72 Accrued benefit liability 38 (1 ) 37 Total liabilities 38 (1 ) 37 Accumulated other comprehensive income (5 ) (54 ) (59 ) Total shareholders equity (5 ) (54 ) (59 ) The following tables summarize net periodic pension cost and other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31: ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Components of net periodic pension cost: Service cost $1 1 1 Interest cost 13 14 15 Expected return on assets (19) (18) (18) Amortization and deferral of transition amount - - (2) Amortization of actuarial loss 9 8 9 Amortization of net prior service cost 1 - 1 Settlement 8 9 10 Net periodic pension cost $13 14 16 ($ in millions) 2006 Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income: Net actuarial loss $89 Prior service cost 3 Total recognized in other comprehensive income 92 Amortization of actuarial loss 9 Amortization of prior service cost 1 Total recognized in net periodic pension cost and other comprehensive income $102 The estimated net actuarial loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost during 2007 are $7 million and $1 million, respectively. The plan assumptions are evaluated annually and are updated as necessary. The discount rate assumption reflects the yield on a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments that have a similar duration to the plans liabilities. The expected long-term rate of return assumption reflects the average return expected on the assets invested to provide for the plans liabilities. In determining the expected long-term rate of return, the Bancorp evaluated actuarial and economic inputs, including long-term inflation rate assumptions and broad equity and bond indices long-term return projections, as well as actual long-term historical plan performance. Fifth Third Bancorp 77 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table summarizes the plan assumptions for the years ended December 31: Weighted-average assumptions 2006 2005 2004 For disclosure: Discount rate 5.80 % 5.375 5.85 Rate of compensation increase 5.00 5.00 5.10 Expected return on plan assets 8.48 8.45 8.00 For measuring net periodic pension cost: Discount rate 5.375 5.65-5.85 6.00 Rate of compensation increase 5.00 5.00 5.00 Expected return on plan assets 8.45 8.00 8.75 Lowering both the expected rate of return on the plan and the discount rate by 0.25% would have increased the 2006 pension expense by approximately $1 million. Plan assets consist primarily of common trust and mutual funds (equities and fixed income) and Bancorp common stock. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, $156 million and $178 million, respectively, of plan assets were managed by Fifth Third Bank, a subsidiary of the Bancorp, through common trust and mutual funds and included $15 million, respectively, of Bancorp common stock. The following table provides the Bancorps weighted-average asset allocations by asset category for 2006 and 2005: Weighted-average asset allocation 2006 2005 Equity securities 69 % 69 Bancorp common stock 6 6 Total equity securities 75 75 Total fixed income securities 22 23 Cash 3 2 Total 100 % 100 The Bancorps policy for the investment of Plan assets is to employ investment strategies that achieve a weighted-average target asset allocation of 70% to 80% in equity securities, 20% to 25% in fixed income securities and up to five percent in cash. Plan assets are not expected to be returned to the Bancorp during 2007. The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit plans was $249 million and $254 million at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, amounts relating to the Bancorps defined benefit plans with an accumulated benefit obligation exceeding assets were as follows: ($ in millions) 2006 2005 Projected benefit obligation $37 38 Accumulated benefit obligation 38 38 Fair value of plan assets - - Based on the actuarial assumptions, the Bancorp does not expect to contribute to the Plan in 2007. Estimated pension benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are $20 million in 2007, $20 million in 2008, $19 million in 2009, $20 million in 2010 and $18 million in 2011. The total estimated payments for the years 2012 through 2016 is $83 million. The Bancorps profit sharing plan expense was $60 million for 2006, $62 million for 2005 and $69 million for 2004. Expenses recognized during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 for matching contributions to the Bancorps defined contribution savings plans were $35 million, $33 million and $28 million, respectively. 23.

(b) The additive effect to income from dividends on convertible preferred stock is $.580 million and the average share dilutive effect from convertible preferred stock is .308 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. During the first quarter of 2006, the Bancorp recognized a benefit for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $4 million, net of $2 million of tax, related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). The benefit recognized relates to the Bancorps estimate of forfeiture experience to be realized for all unvested stock-based awards outstanding. Options to purchase 33.1 million, 28.1 million and 16.2 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were not included in the computation of net income per diluted share because the exercise price of these options were greater than the average market price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive. 78 Fifth Third Bancorp NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24.

In addition, certain non-financial instruments were excluded from the fair value disclosure requirements. Therefore, the fair values presented in the table above should not be construed as the underlying value of the Bancorp. The following methods and assumptions were used in determining the fair value of selected financial instruments: Short-term financial assets and liabilities: For financial instruments with a short-term or no stated maturity, prevailing market rates and limited credit risk, carrying amounts approximate fair value. Those financial instruments include cash and due from banks, other short-term investments, certain deposits (demand, interest checking, savings and money market), federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. Available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, trading and other securities, including short positions: Fair values were based on prices obtained from an independent nationally recognized pricing service. Loans held for sale: The fair value of loans held for sale was estimated based on outstanding commitments from investors or current investor yield requirements. Portfolio loans and leases, net: Fair values were estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. Derivative assets and derivative liabilities Fair values were based on the estimated amount the Bancorp would receive or pay to terminate the derivative contracts, taking into account the current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. The fair values represent an asset or liability at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Bank owned life insurance assets: Fair values of insurance policies owned by the Bancorp were based on the insurance contracts cash surrender value, net of any policy loans. Deposits: Fair values for other time, certificates of deposit $100,000 and over and foreign office were estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Long-term debt: Fair value of long-term debt was based on quoted market prices, when available, or a discounted cash flow calculation using prevailing market rates for borrowings of similar terms. Commitments to extend credit: Fair values of loan commitments were based on estimated probable credit losses. Letters of credit: Fair values of letters of credit were based on unamortized fees on the letters of credit. 25. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS On January 1, 2005, the Bancorp acquired in a merger 100% of the outstanding stock of First National Bankshares, Inc. (First National), a bank holding company headquartered in Naples, Florida. First National operated 77 full-service banking centers located primarily in Orlando, Tampa, Sarasota, Naples and Fort Myers. The acquisition of First National allowed the Bancorp to increase its presence in the rapidly expanding Florida market. Under the terms of the transaction, each share of First National common stock was exchanged for .5065 shares of the Bancorps common stock, resulting in the issuance of 30.6 million shares of common stock. The common stock issued to effect the transaction was valued at $47.30 per share, the closing price of the Bancorps common stock on the previous trading day, for a total transaction value of $1.5 billion. The total purchase price also included the fair value of stock-based awards issued in exchange for stock-based awards held by First National employees, for which the aggregate fair value was $63 million. The assets and liabilities of First National were recorded on the Bancorps Consolidated Balance Sheet at their respective fair values as of the closing date. The results of First Nationals operations were included in the Bancorps Consolidated Statements of Income from the date of acquisition. In addition, the Bancorp realized charges against its earnings for acquisition related expenses of $8 million during 2005. The acquisition related expenses consisted primarily of travel and relocation costs, printing, closure of duplicate facilities, supplies and other costs associated with the conversion. Fifth Third Bancorp 79 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The transaction resulted in total goodwill and intangible assets of $1.3 billion based upon the purchase price, the fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities and applicable purchase accounting adjustments. Of this total intangibles amount, $85 million was allocated to core deposit intangibles, $7 million was allocated to customer lists and $13 million was allocated to noncompete agreements. The core deposit intangible and the customer lists are being amortized using an accelerated method over 10 years. The noncompete agreements are being amortized using the straight-line method over the duration of the agreements. The remaining $1.2 billion of intangible assets was recorded as goodwill and is not being amortized. Goodwill recognized in the First National acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes. On June 11, 2004, the Bancorp completed the acquisition of Franklin Financial, a bank holding company located in the Nashville, Tennessee metropolitan market. Under the terms of the transaction, each share of Franklin Financial common stock was exchanged for .5933 shares of the Bancorps common stock, resulting in the issuance of 5.1 million shares of common stock. The common stock issued to effect the transaction was valued at $55.52 per share for a total transaction value of $317 million. The total purchase price also included the fair value of stock-based awards issued in exchange for stock-based awards held by Franklin employees, for which the aggregate fair value was $36 million. The assets and liabilities of Franklin Financial were recorded on the Bancorps Consolidated Balance Sheet at their respective fair values as of the closing date. The results of Franklin Financials operations were included in the Bancorps Consolidated Statements of Income from the date of acquisition. The transaction resulted in total intangible assets of $281 million based upon the purchase price, the fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities and applicable purchase accounting adjustments. Of this total intangibles amount, $7 million was allocated to core deposit intangibles, $6 million was allocated to customer lists and $2 million was allocated to noncompete agreements. The core deposit intangible and the customer lists are being amortized using an accelerated method over seven and five years, respectively. The noncompete agreements are being amortized using the straight-line method over the duration of the agreements. The remaining $266 million of intangible assets was recorded as goodwill and is not being amortized. Goodwill recognized in the Franklin Financial acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes. The pro forma effect of the financial results of First National and Franklin Financial included in the results of operations subsequent to the date of acquisition were not material to the Bancorps financial condition and operating results for the periods presented. 26. CERTAIN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND CAPITAL RATIOS The principal source of income and funds for the Bancorp (parent company) are dividends from its subsidiaries. During 2006, the amount of dividends the bank subsidiaries could pay to the Bancorp without prior approval of regulatory agencies was limited to their 2006 eligible net profits, as defined, and the adjusted retained 2005 and 2004 net income of those subsidiaries. The Bancorps subsidiary banks must maintain cash reserve balances when total reservable deposit liabilities are greater than the regulatory exemption. These reserve requirements may be satisfied with vault cash and noninterest-bearing cash balances on reserve with a Federal Reserve Bank. In 2006 and 2005, the subsidiary banks were required to maintain average cash reserve balances of $289 million and $211 million, respectively. The FRB adopted guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. These guidelines include quantitative measures that assign risk weightings to assets and off-balance sheet items, as well as define and set minimum regulatory capital requirements. All bank holding companies are required to maintain core capital (Tier I) of at least 4% of risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items (Tier I capital ratio), total capital of at least 8% of risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items (Total risk- based capital ratio) and Tier I capital of at least 3% of adjusted quarterly average assets (Tier I leverage ratio). Failure to meet the minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bancorp. Tier I capital consists principally of shareholders equity including Tier I qualifying subordinated debt but excluding unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and unrecognized pension actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost, less goodwill and certain other intangibles. Tier II capital consists principally of perpetual and trust preferred stock that is not eligible to be included as Tier I capital, term subordinated debt, intermediate-term preferred stock and, subject to limitations, general allowances for loan and lease losses. Assets are adjusted under the risk-based guidelines to take into account different risk characteristics. Average assets for this purpose does not include goodwill and any other intangible assets and investments that the FRB determines should be deducted from Tier I capital. Both the FRB and the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have issued regulations regarding the capital adequacy of subsidiary banks. These requirements are substantially similar to those adopted by the FRB regarding bank holding companies, as described above. In addition, the federal banking agencies have issued substantially similar regulations to implement the system of prompt corrective action established by Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Under the regulations, a bank generally shall be deemed to be well-capitalized if it has a Total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more, a Tier I capital ratio of 6% or more, a Tier I leverage ratio of 5% or more and is not subject to any written capital order or directive. If an institution becomes undercapitalized, it would become subject to significant additional oversight, regulations and requirements as mandated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The Bancorp and each of its subsidiary banks had Tier I, Total risk-based capital and Tier I leverage ratios above the well-capitalized levels at December 31, 2006 and 2005. As of December 31, 2006, the most recent notification from the FRB categorized the Bancorp and each of its subsidiary banks as well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To continue to qualify for financial holding company status pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the Bancorps subsidiary banks must, among other things, maintain well capitalized capital ratios. U.S. bank regulatory authorities and international bank supervisory organizations, principally the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, are currently considering changes to the risk-based capital adequacy framework for banks, including emphasis on credit, market and operational risk components, which ultimately could affect the appropriate capital guidelines for bank holding companies such as the Bancorp. 80 Fifth Third Bancorp NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Capital and risk-based capital and leverage ratios for the Bancorp and its significant subsidiary banks at December 31: 2006 2005 ($ in millions) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Total risk-based capital (to risk-weighted assets): Fifth Third Bancorp (Consolidated) $ 11,385 11.07 % $ 10,240 10.42 % Fifth Third Bank (Ohio) 6,573 12.82 6,237 12.61 Fifth Third Bank (Michigan) 5,814 11.41 5,352 10.98 Fifth Third Bank, N.A. 216 11.78 177 12.05 Tier I capital (to risk-weighted assets): Fifth Third Bancorp (Consolidated) 8,625 8.39 8,209 8.35 Fifth Third Bank (Ohio) 5,336 10.41 4,973 10.05 Fifth Third Bank (Michigan) 5,341 10.48 4,922 10.10 Fifth Third Bank, N.A. 203 11.07 167 11.33 Tier I leverage (to average assets): Fifth Third Bancorp (Consolidated) 8,625 8.44 8,209 8.08 Fifth Third Bank (Ohio) 5,336 9.53 4,973 8.77 Fifth Third Bank (Michigan) 5,341 11.30 4,922 10.75 Fifth Third Bank, N.A. 203 12.52 167 12.24 27.

The Other/Eliminations column includes the unallocated portion of the investment portfolio, certain non-deposit funding, unassigned equity and certain support activities and other items not attributed to the business segments. Results of the Bancorps business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorps business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management accounting practices are improved and businesses change. Revisions to the Bancorps methodologies are applied on a retroactive basis. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Bancorp changed the application of the provision for loan and lease losses to the segments to include only actual net charge-offs. The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level by employing a funds transfer pricing (FTP) methodology. This methodology insulates the business segments from interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on servicing customers through loan originations and deposit taking. The FTP system assigns charge rates and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on expected duration. During 2006, the Bancorp made certain changes to the average duration of indeterminate-lived deposits and corresponding changes to the FTP crediting rates assigned to those deposits. This change more closely aligns the crediting rates to the expected economic benefit while continuing to insulate the segments from interest rate volatility. Prior year results are restated and presented on a comparable basis. The net impact of the FTP methodology is included in Other/Eliminations. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarter expenses. Even with these allocations, the financial results are not necessarily indicative of the business segments financial condition and results of operations as if they were to exist as independent entities. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of cross-sell opportunities and when funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit. The financial information for each segment is reported on the basis used internally by the Bancorps management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. The allocation has been consistently applied for all periods presented. Revenues from affiliated transactions are typically charged at rates available to and transacted with unaffiliated customers. Results of operations and average assets by segment for each of the three years ended December 31 are: ($ in millions) Commercial Banking Branch Banking Consumer Lending Investment Advisors ProcessingSolutions Other/ Eliminations Total 2006 Net interest income (a) $1,254 1,290 380 125 33 (183) 2,899 Provision for loan and lease losses 105 101 94 3 10 30 343 Net interest income after provision for loan and lease losses 1,149 1,189 286 122 23 (213) 2,556 Noninterest income: Electronic payment processing revenue 13 195 - 1 694 (46) 857 Service charges on deposits 147 358 - 7 5 - 517 Mortgage banking net revenue - 5 148 2 - - 155 Investment advisory revenue 3 87 - 367 - (90) 367 Corporate banking revenue 304 12 - 2 1 (1) 318 Other noninterest income 48 106 78 7 4 57 300 Securities gains (losses), net - - - - 78 (442) (364) Securities gains, net  non qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights - - 3 - - - 3 Total noninterest income 515 763 229 386 782 (522) 2,153 Noninterest expense: Salaries, wages and incentives 196 353 68 143 58 356 1,174 Employee benefits 44 98 33 29 13 75 292 Equipment expense 2 32 1 1 10 76 122 Net occupancy expense 14 121 8 10 3 89 245 Other noninterest expense 505 468 193 200 443 (586) 1,223 Total noninterest expense 761 1,072 303 383 527 10 3,056 Income before income taxes and cumulative effect 903 880 212 125 278 (745) 1,653 Applicable income taxes (a) 252 310 75 44 98 (310) 469 Income before cumulative effect 651 570 137 81 180 (435) 1,184 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax 4 4 Net income $651 570 137 81 180 (431) 1,188 Average assets $36,037 42,852 21,883 5,519 1,235 (2,288) 105,238 (a) Includes taxable-equivalent adjustments of $26 million. 82 Fifth Third Bancorp NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ($ in millions) Commercial Banking Branch Banking Consumer Lending Investment Advisors ProcessingSolutions Other/ Eliminations Total 2005 Net interest income (a) $1,190 1,251 397 131 28 (1) 2,996 Provision for loan and lease losses 97 91 90 4 18 30 330 Net interest income after provision for loan and lease losses 1,093 1,160 307 127 10 (31) 2,666 Noninterest income: Electronic payment processing revenue 13 164 - 1 612 (42) 748 Service charges on deposits 153 359 - 7 5 (2) 522 Mortgage banking net revenue - 5 165 2 - 2 174 Investment advisory revenue 3 86 - 360 - (91) 358 Corporate banking revenue 287 13 - 2 1 (4) 299 Other noninterest income 38 89 125 4 15 89 360 Securities gains (losses), net - - - - - 39 39 Total noninterest income 494 716 290 376 633 (9) 2,500 Noninterest expense: Salaries, wages and incentives 194 355 66 141 44 333 1,133 Employee benefits 45 101 32 29 9 67 283 Equipment expense 1 28 1 1 3 71 105 Net occupancy expense 12 109 7 8 3 82 221 Other noninterest expense 465 437 244 206 403 (570) 1,185 Total noninterest expense 717 1,030 350 385 462 (17) 2,927 Income before income taxes 870 846 247 118 181 (23) 2,239 Applicable income taxes (a) 256 298 87 42 64 (57) 690 Net income $614 548 160 76 117 34 1,549 Average assets $32,247 40,291 20,238 4,569 1,140 4,391 102,876 (a) Includes taxable-equivalent adjustments of $31 million.

PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS General Information Fifth Third Bancorp, an Ohio corporation organized in 1975, is a bank holding company as defined by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHCA), and is registered as such with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). The Bancorps principal office is located in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Bancorps subsidiaries provide a wide range of financial products and services to the retail, commercial, financial, governmental, educational and medical sectors, including a wide variety of checking, savings and money market accounts, and credit products such as credit cards, installment loans, mortgage loans and lease. Each of the banking subsidiaries has deposit insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) through the Deposit Insurance Fund. Refer to Exhibit 21 filed as an attachment to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of all the subsidiaries of the Bancorp. Additional information regarding the Bancorps businesses is included in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Competition The Bancorp competes for deposits, loans and other banking services in its principal geographic markets as well as in selected national markets as opportunities arise. In addition to the challenge of attracting and retaining customers for traditional banking services, the Bancorps competitors include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors and insurance companies. These competitors, with focused products targeted at highly profitable customer segments, compete across geographic boundaries and provide customers increasing access to meaningful alternatives to banking services in nearly all significant products. The increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation, changes in technology, product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. These competitive trends are likely to continue. Acquisitions The Bancorps strategy for growth includes strengthening its presence in core markets, expanding into contiguous markets and broadening its product offerings while taking into account the integration and other risks of growth. The Bancorp evaluates strategic acquisition opportunities and conducts due diligence activities in connection with possible transactions. As a result, discussions, and in some cases, negotiations may take place and future acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur. These typically involve the payment of a premium over book value and current market price, and therefore, some dilution of book value and net income per share may occur with any future transactions. Additional information regarding acquisitions is included in the Regulation and Supervision section in addition to Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Regulation and Supervision In addition to the generally applicable state and federal laws governing businesses and employers, the Bancorp and its subsidiary banks are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions and their parent companies. Virtually all aspects of the business of the Bancorp and its subsidiary banks are subject to specific requirements or restrictions and general regulatory oversight. The principal objectives of state and federal banking laws are the maintenance of the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the federal deposit insurance system and the protection of consumers or classes of consumers, rather than the specific protection of shareholders of a bank or the parent company of a bank, such as the Bancorp. In addition, the supervision, regulation and examination of the Bancorp and its subsidiaries by the bank regulatory agencies is not intended for the protection of the Bancorps security holders. To the extent the following material describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation. The Bancorp is subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB and the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions (the Division). The Bancorp is required to file various reports with, and is subject to examination by, the FRB and the Division. The FRB has the authority to issue orders to bank holding companies to cease and desist from unsound banking practices and violations of conditions imposed by, or violations of agreements with, the FRB. The FRB is also empowered to assess civil money penalties against companies or individuals who violate the BHCA or orders or regulations thereunder, to order termination of non-banking activities of non-banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies, and to order termination of ownership and control of a non-banking subsidiary by a bank holding company. The BHCA requires the prior approval of the FRB, for a bank holding company to acquire substantially all the assets of a bank or acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of any bank, bank holding company or savings association, or increasing any such non-majority ownership or control of any bank, bank holding company or savings association, or merging or consolidating with any bank holding company. The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 generally authorizes bank holding companies to acquire banks located in any state, subject to certain state-imposed age and deposit concentration limits, and also generally authorizes interstate bank holding company and bank mergers and to a lesser extent, interstate branching. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) permits a qualifying bank holding company to become a financial holding company (FHC) and thereby to engage directly or indirectly in a broader range of activities than had previously been permitted for a bank holding company under the BHCA. Permitted activities include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and brokerage, merchant banking and other activities that are declared by the FRB, in cooperation with the Treasury Department, to be financial in nature or incidental thereto or are declared by the FRB unilaterally to be complementary to financial activities. In addition, a FHC is allowed to conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire permissible non-bank financial companies with after-the-fact notice to the FRB. A bank holding company may elect to become a FHC if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized, is well managed and has at least a Satisfactory rating under the Federal Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). In 2000, the Bancorp elected and qualified for FHC status under the GLBA. Unless a bank holding company becomes a FHC under GLBA, the BHCA also prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring a direct or indirect interest in or control of more than Fifth Third Bancorp 85 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K 5% of any class of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiary banks, except that it may engage in and may own shares of companies engaged in certain activities the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be proper incident thereto. The FRB has authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The FRB has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for bank holding companies to pay dividends unless a bank holding companys net income is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organizations capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Bancorp depends in part upon dividends received from its subsidiary banks to fund its activities, including the payment of dividends. Each of the subsidiary banks is subject to regulatory limitations on the amount of dividends it may declare and pay. Under FRB policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to their support. This support may be required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide it. Similarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), the FDIC can hold any FDIC-insured depository institution liable for any loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with (1) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution; or (2) any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution in danger of default. The Bancorp owns two state banks, Fifth Third Bank and Fifth Third Bank (Michigan), chartered under the laws of Ohio and Michigan, respectively. These banks are subject to extensive state regulation and examination by the appropriate state banking agency in the particular state or states where each state bank is chartered, by the FRB, and by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of each of the state banks to the maximum extent permitted by law. The federal and state laws and regulations that are applicable to banks regulate, among other matters, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, the amount of loans to individual and related borrowers and the nature, amount of and collateral for certain loans, and the amount of interest that may be charged on loans. Various state consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the state banks. The Bancorps national subsidiary bank, Fifth Third Bank, N.A. is subject to regulation and examination primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and secondarily by the FRB and the FDIC, which insures the deposits to the maximum extent permitted by law. The federal laws and regulations that are applicable to national banks regulate, among other matters, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, the amount of loans to individual and related borrowers and the nature, amount of and collateral for certain loans, and the amount of interest that may be charged on loans. In 2006, the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 was signed into law (FDIRA). Pursuant to the FDIRA, the Bank Insurance Fund and Savings Association Insurance Fund were merged to create the Deposit Insurance Fund. On January 1, 2007, final rules under the FDIRA became effective which set a base assessment schedule for 2007 for Deposit Insurance Fund premiums. Under the final rules, for banks with over $10 billion in assets the premium assessment will be determined by factors including the institutions CAMELS component ratings, and, if available, long-term debt issuer ratings. The final rules also provide that the FDIC will apply assessment credits to offset 100% of a banks entire premium charge in 2007 and up to 90% of a banks premium charge in 2008, 2009 and 2010 until the credit is exhausted. The Bancorp expects its assessment credits to be exhausted in 2008. Given current CAMEL ratings and deposit balances as of December 31, 2006, the Bancorp expects to incur FDIC insurance assessments of less than $1 million in 2007, $8 million in 2008 and $34 million in 2009. Federal law, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, restricts transactions between a bank and an affiliated company, including a parent bank holding company. The subsidiary banks are subject to certain restrictions on loans to affiliated companies, on investments in the stock or securities thereof, on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower, and on the issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit on their behalf. Among other things, these restrictions limit the amount of such transactions, require collateral in prescribed amounts for extensions of credit, prohibit the purchase of low quality assets and require that the terms of such transactions be substantially equivalent to terms of similar transactions with non-affiliates. One result of these restrictions is a limitation on the subsidiary banks to fund the Bancorp. Generally, each subsidiary bank is limited in its extensions of credit to any affiliate to 10% of the subsidiary banks capital and its extension of credit to all affiliates to 20% of the subsidiary banks capital. The CRA generally requires insured depository institutions to identify the communities they serve and to make loans and investments and provide services that meet the credit needs of these communities. Furthermore, the CRA requires the FRB to evaluate the performance of each of the subsidiary banks in helping to meet the credit needs of their communities. As a part of the CRA program, the subsidiary banks are subject to periodic examinations by the FRB, and must maintain comprehensive records of their CRA activities for this purpose. During these examinations, the FRB rates such institutions compliance with CRA as Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve or Substantial Noncompliance. Failure of an institution to receive at least a Satisfactory rating could inhibit such institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities, including engaging in activities permitted as a financial holding company under the GLBA and acquisitions of other financial institutions, or, as discussed above, require divestitures. The FRB must take into account the record of performance of banks in meeting the credit needs of the entire community served, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Fifth Third Bank and Fifth Third Bank (Michigan) received an Outstanding CRA rating and Fifth Third Bank, N.A. received a Satisfactory rating. Because the Bancorp is an FHC, with limited exceptions, the Bancorp may not commence any new financial activities or acquire control of any companies engaged in financial activities in reliance on the GLBA if any of the subsidiary banks receives a CRA rating of less than Satisfactory. The FRB has established capital guidelines for financial holding companies. The FRB and the OCC have also issued regulations establishing capital requirements for banks. Failure to meet capital requirements could subject the Bancorp and its 86 Fifth Third Bancorp ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K subsidiary banks to a variety of restrictions and enforcement actions. In addition, as discussed above, each of the Bancorps subsidiary banks must remain well capitalized for the Bancorp to retain its status as a financial holding company. The minimum risk-based capital requirements adopted by the federal banking agencies follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. In 2004, the Basel Committee published its new capital guidelines (Basel II) governing the capital adequacy of large, internationally active banking organizations. Studies of the impact of Basel II on the large banks that will operate under the new rules indicated that such banks could benefit from a material reduction in minimum risk based capital requirements. In response to the potential inequities between the Basel II banks and other banks, in December 2006, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed changes to the risk based capital rules for banks in the U.S. which will not be subject to Basel II, known as Basel IA. In Basel IA, the banking agencies are proposing to expand the number of risk-weight categories, allow the use of external ratings to risk-weight certain exposures, expand the range of recognized collateral and eligible guarantors, use loan-to-value ratios to risk-weight residential mortgages, increase the credit conversion factor for certain commitments with an original maturity of one year or less, assess a charge for early amortizations in securitizations of revolving exposures, and remove the 50 percent limit on the risk weight for certain derivative transactions. Until such time as final rules are adopted, the Bancorp is unable to predict whether and when it will be subject to new capital requirements. The FRB, FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted final guidelines (the Guidelines) for safeguarding confidential, personal customer information. The Guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its Board of Directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. The Bancorp has adopted a customer information security program that has been approved by the Bancorps Board of Directors (the Board). The GLBA requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. In general, the statute requires explanations to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information, and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibits disclosing such information except as provided in the subsidiary banks policies and procedures. The subsidiary banks have implemented a privacy policy effective since the GLBA became law, pursuant to which all of its existing and new customers are notified of the privacy policies. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act), designed to deny terrorists and others the ability to obtain access to the United States financial system, has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The Patriot Act, as implemented by various federal regulatory agencies, requires financial institutions, including the Bancorp and its subsidiaries, to implement new policies and procedures or amend existing policies and procedures with respect to, among other matters, anti-money laundering, compliance, suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. The Patriot Act and its underlying regulations also permit information sharing for counter-terrorist purposes between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, subject to certain conditions, and require the FRB (and other federal banking agencies) to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering activities when considering applications filed under Section 3 of the BHCA or the Bank Merger Act. The Bancorps Board has approved policies and procedures that are believed to be compliant with the Patriot Act. Certain mutual fund and unit investment trust custody and administrative clients are regulated as investment companies as that term is defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the ICA), and are subject to various examination and reporting requirements. The provisions of the ICA and the regulations promulgated thereunder prescribe the type of institution that may act as a custodian of investment company assets, as well as the manner in which a custodian administers the assets in its custody. As a custodian for a number of investment company clients, these regulations require, among other things, that certain minimum aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profit levels are maintained by the subsidiary banks. Additionally, arrangements with clearing agencies or other securities depositories must meet ICA requirements for segregation of assets, identification of assets and client approval. Future legislative and regulatory changes in the existing laws and regulations governing custody of investment company assets, particularly with respect to custodian qualifications, may have a material and adverse impact on the Bancorp. Currently, management believes the Bancorp is in compliance with all minimum capital and securities depository requirements. Further, the Bancorp is not aware of any proposed or pending regulatory developments, which, if approved, would adversely affect its ability to act as custodian to an investment company. Investment companies are also subject to extensive record keeping and reporting requirements. These requirements dictate the type, volume and duration of the record keeping the Bancorp undertakes, either in the role as custodian for an investment company or as a provider of administrative services to an investment company. Further, specific ICA guidelines must be followed when calculating the net asset value of a client mutual fund. Consequently, changes in the statutes or regulations governing recordkeeping and reporting or valuation calculations will affect the manner in which operations are conducted. New legislation or regulatory requirements could have a significant impact on the information reporting requirements applicable to the Bancorp and may in the short term adversely affect the Bancorps ability to service clients at a reasonable cost. Any failure to provide such support could cause the loss of customers and have a material adverse effect on financial results. Additionally, legislation or regulations may be proposed or enacted to regulate the Bancorp in a manner that may adversely affect financial results. Furthermore, the mutual fund industry may be significantly affected by new laws and regulations. The GLBA amended the federal securities laws to eliminate the blanket exceptions that banks traditionally have had from the definition of broker and dealer. The GLBA also required that there be certain transactional activities that Fifth Third Bancorp 87 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K would not be brokerage activities, which banks could effect without having to register as a broker. In a series of orders, the SEC delayed the effective date of the repeal of the broker exemption for banks until, most recently, July 2, 2007. On December 13, 2006, the FRB and SEC jointly proposed new Regulation R, that will govern bank securities broker activities. As currently proposed, we will have until January 1, 2009 to comply by either registering as a broker-dealer or pushing out brokerage activities to affiliated broker-dealers. The transactional exemptions will permit, without broker-dealer registration, banks to enter into a de minimis number of riskless principal transactions, certain asset-backed transactions and certain securities lending transactions. The Bancorp is currently evaluating alternatives to ensure that its subsidiary banks will not be required to register as a broker upon the effective date. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (Sarbanes-Oxley) implements a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures for public companies (including publicly-held bank holding companies such as the Bancorp) designed to promote honesty and transparency in corporate America. Sarbanes-Oxleys principal provisions, many of which have been interpreted through regulations, provide for and include, among other things: (i) the creation of an independent accounting oversight board; (ii) auditor independence provisions that restrict non-audit services that accountants may provide to their audit clients; (iii) additional corporate governance and responsibility measures, including the requirement that the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of a public company certify financial statements; (iv) the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuers securities by directors and senior officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement; (v) an increase in the oversight of, and enhancement of certain requirements relating to, audit committees of public companies and how they interact with the Bancorps independent auditors; (vi) requirements that audit committee members must be independent and are barred from accepting consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees from the issuer; (vii) requirements that companies disclose whether at least one member of the audit committee is a financial expert (as such term is defined by the SEC) and if not discussed, why the audit committee does not have a financial expert; (viii) expanded disclosure requirements for corporate insiders, including accelerated reporting of stock transactions by insiders and a prohibition on insider trading during pension blackout periods; (ix) a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers, except certain loans made by insured financial institutions on nonpreferential terms and in compliance with other bank regulatory requirements; (x) disclosure of a code of ethics and filing a Form 8-K for a change or waiver of such code; (xi) requirements that management assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the Bancorps Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm attest to the assessment; and (xii) a range of enhanced penalties for fraud and other violations.
