ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. You should carefully consider the following factors and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks which we do not presently consider material, or of which we are not currently aware, may also have an adverse impact on us. Please also see "Important Factors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" on page (ii). Demand for our merchandise may decrease and the appeal of our brand image may diminish if we fail to identify and rapidly respond to consumers' fashion tastes. The apparel industry is subject to rapidly evolving fashion trends and shifting consumer demands. Accordingly, our brand image and our profitability are heavily dependent upon both the priority our target customers place on fashion and on our ability to anticipate, identify and capitalize upon emerging fashion trends. Current fashion tastes place significant emphasis on a fashionable look. In the past, this emphasis has increased and decreased through fashion cycles. If we fail to anticipate, identify or react appropriately, or in a timely manner, to fashion trends, we could experience reduced consumer acceptance of our products, a diminished brand image and higher markdowns. These factors could result in lower selling prices and sales volumes for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 14 The apparel industry is highly competitive, and we may face difficulties competing successfully in the future. We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry with low barriers to entry. We compete with many apparel manufacturers and distributors, both domestically and internationally, as well as many well-known designers, some of whom have substantially greater resources than we do and some of whose products are priced lower than ours. Our retail and factory outlet stores compete with many other retailers, including department stores, some of whom are our major wholesale customers. Our licensed apparel and accessories compete with many well-known brands. Within each of our geographic markets, we also face significant competition from global and regional branded apparel companies, as well as retailers that market apparel under their own labels. These and other competitors pose significant challenges to our market share in our existing major domestic and foreign markets. In addition, our larger competitors may be better equipped than us to adapt to changing conditions that affect the competitive market. Also, the industry's low barriers to entry allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace. Any of these factors could result in reductions in sales or prices of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in the economy and trends in consumer confidence may adversely affect the fashion industry as well as our operating results. The industry in which we operate is cyclical. Purchases of apparel and related merchandise are generally discretionary and therefore tend to decline during recessionary periods and also may decline at other times. Reduced levels of consumer spending, both domestically and internationally, can also result from (i) increases in interest rates, (ii) declines in the availability of consumer credit, (iii) increases in taxation rates, (iv) decreases in consumer confidence in future economic conditions and (v) reductions in levels of consumer disposable income resulting from any number of factors such as the subprime mortgage crisis and the continued increases in oil prices. Due to these cyclical factors in the retail industry, we may not be able to maintain our growth in revenues or earnings, or remain profitable in the future, particularly during economic downturns or periods of economic instability. Actual or potential terrorist acts and other conflicts in recent periods have also created significant instability and uncertainty in the world and may have additional effects in the future. These may include causing consumers to defer purchases or preventing our suppliers and service providers from providing required services or materials to us. These or other impacts could materially and adversely affect our operating results. We could find that we are carrying excess inventories if we fail to anticipate consumer demand, if our international vendors do not supply quality products on a timely basis, if our merchandising strategies fail or if we do not open new and remodel existing stores on schedule. Because we must place orders with our vendors for most of our products a season or more in advance, we could end up carrying excess inventories if we fail to correctly anticipate fashion trends or consumer demand. Even if we correctly anticipate consumer fashion trends and demand, our vendors could fail to supply the quality products and materials we require at the time we need them. Moreover, we could fail to effectively market or merchandise these products once we receive them. In addition, we could fail to open new or remodeled stores on schedule, and inventory purchases made in anticipation of such store openings could remain unsold. Any of the above factors could cause us to experience excess inventories and higher markdowns, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our success depends on maintaining good working relationships with our suppliers and manufacturers. We do not own or operate any production facilities equipment, and we depend on independent contractors to supply our fabrics and to manufacture our products to our specifications. We do not have long-term contracts with any suppliers or manufacturers, and our business is dependent on continued good 15 relations with our vendors. In addition, none of our suppliers or manufacturers supplies or manufactures our products exclusively. As a result, we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers and international import quota capacity. If our vendors or manufacturers fail to ship our fabrics or products on time or to meet our quality standards or are unable to fill our orders, we might not be able to deliver products to our retail stores and wholesale customers on time or at all. Moreover, our manufacturers have at times been unable to deliver finished products in a timely fashion. This has led, from time to time, to an increase in our inventory, creating potential markdowns and a resulting decrease in our profitability. As there are a limited number of qualified offshore manufacturers, it could take significant time to find alternative manufacturers, which could result in our missing retailing seasons or our wholesale customers' canceling orders, refusing to accept deliveries or requiring that we lower selling prices. Since we cannot return merchandise to our manufacturers, we could also have a significant amount of unsold merchandise. Any of these problems could harm our financial condition and results of operations. Our North American wholesale business is highly concentrated. The decision by any of our large customers to decrease their purchases of our products or stop carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In fiscal 2008, 4.4% of our consolidated net revenue came from Macy's, Inc. No other single customer or group of related customers accounted for more than 5% of our net revenue in fiscal 2008. Continued consolidation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of, or concentrate the ownership of, stores that carry our and our licensees' products. Also, as we expand the number of our retail stores, we run the risk that our wholesale customers will perceive that we are increasingly competing directly with them, which may lead them to reduce or terminate purchases of our products. In addition, in recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of designer brands seeking placement in department stores, which makes any one brand potentially less attractive to department stores. If any one of our major wholesale customers decides to decrease purchases from us, to stop carrying GUESS? products or to carry our products only on terms less favorable to us, our sales and profitability could significantly decrease. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Since we do not control our licensees' actions and we depend on our licensees for a substantial portion of our earnings from operations, their conduct could harm our business. We license to others the rights to produce and market certain products that are sold with our trademarks. While we retain significant control over our licensees' products and advertising, we rely on our licensees for, among other things, operational and financial control over their businesses. If the quality, focus, image or distribution of our licensed products diminish, consumer acceptance of and demand for the GUESS? brand and products could decline. This could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In fiscal 2008, approximately 80% of our net royalties were derived from our top five licensed product lines. A decrease in customer demand for any of these product lines could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Although we believe that in most circumstances we could replace existing licensees if necessary, our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. We depend on our intellectual property, and our methods of protecting it may not be adequate. Our success and competitive position depend significantly upon our trademarks and other proprietary rights. We take steps to establish and protect our trademarks worldwide. Despite any precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property, policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property or to determine the extent of any unauthorized use, particularly in those foreign countries where the laws do not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We also place significant value on our trade dress and the overall appearance and image of our products. However, we cannot assure you that we can prevent 16 imitation of our products by others or prevent others from seeking to block sales of GUESS? products for violating their trademarks and proprietary rights. We also cannot assure you that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of GUESS?, that our proprietary rights would be upheld if challenged or that we would, in that event, not be prevented from using our trademarks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, we could incur substantial costs in legal actions relating to our use of intellectual property or the use of our intellectual property by others. Even if we are successful in such actions, the costs we incur could have a material adverse effect on us. We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources. We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert management's attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. See also "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" for further discussion of the Company's legal matters. If we fail to successfully execute our growth initiatives, including through acquisitions, our business and results of operations could be harmed. As part of our business growth initiatives, we regularly open new stores, in both existing and new store concepts, in the United States and Canada. We also regularly evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances and pursue those that we believe will support and contribute to our overall growth initiatives. For instance, we completed the acquisition of our former European jeanswear licensee during 2005, the acquisition of 75% of the outstanding shares of our former European licensee of GUESS by MARCIANO apparel in December 2006 and the acquisition of our former European licensee of children's apparel in January 2008. We have also continued our international expansion by opening new stores outside the U.S., primarily in the form of stores owned by our international licensees and distributors, but also through Company-owned stores and concessions. We plan to continue opening new stores in the U.S. and internationally. This expansion effort places increased demands on our managerial, operational and administrative resources that could prevent or delay the successful opening of new stores, adversely impact the performance of our existing stores and adversely impact our overall results of operations. In addition, acquired businesses may not provide us with increased business opportunities, or result in the growth that we anticipate. Furthermore, integrating acquired operations is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. Failing to acquire and successfully integrate complementary businesses, or failing to achieve the business synergies or other anticipated benefits of acquisitions, could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may be unsuccessful in implementing our planned North America retail expansion, which could harm our business and negatively affect our results of operations. To open and operate new stores successfully, we must: identify desirable locations, the availability of which is out of our control; negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement allowances; build and equip the new stores; source sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of the new stores; hire, train and retain competent store personnel; 17 successfully integrate the new stores into our existing operations; and satisfy the fashion preferences of customers in the new geographic areas. Any of these challenges could delay our store openings, prevent us from completing our store opening plans or hinder the operations of stores we do open. We cannot be sure that we can successfully complete our planned expansion or that our new stores will be profitable. Such things as unfavorable economic and business conditions and changing consumer preferences could also interfere with our plans to expand. Failure to successfully develop and manage our new store concepts could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition to our core GUESS? retail and factory stores, we continue to develop and refine the MARCIANO, GUESS? Accessories, G by GUESS and new footwear store concepts. The introduction and growth of several new store concepts as part of our overall growth strategy could strain our financial and management resources. Additionally, successfully developing new brands is subject to a number of risks, including customer acceptance, product differentiation, competition and obtaining desirable locations. There can be no assurance that these concepts will achieve or maintain sales and profitability levels that justify the required investments. If we are unable to successfully develop and manage these multiple store concepts, or if consumers are not receptive to the products or store concepts, our results of operations and financial results could be adversely affected. Much of our business is international and can be disrupted by factors beyond our control. We have been reducing our reliance on domestic contractors and expanding our use of direct sourced offshore manufacturers as a cost-effective means to produce our products. During fiscal 2008, we sourced a significant amount of our finished products through third-party suppliers located outside the United States and we continued to purchase fabrics outside the United States. As we focus strategically on progressively more direct sourcing, we are expanding our Hong Kong office infrastructure to allow us to develop, engineer and source directly from overseas factories. In addition, we have been increasing our international sales of product outside of the United States. In fiscal 2008, approximately 51.5% of our consolidated net revenue was generated by sales from outside of the United States. We anticipate that these international revenues will continue to grow as a percentage of our total business. As a result of our increasing international operations, we face the possibility of greater losses from a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from a number of factors which are beyond our control. Such factors that could harm our results of operations and financial condition include, among other things: political instability or acts of terrorism, which disrupt trade with the countries in which our contractors, suppliers or customers are located; difficulties in managing our foreign operations; local business practices that do not conform to legal or ethical guidelines; adoption of additional or revised quotas, restrictions or regulations relating to imports or exports; additional or increased customs duties, tariffs, taxes and other charges on imports; delays in receipts due to our distribution centers as a result of increasing security requirements at U.S. ports; significant fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies; increased difficulty in protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions; social, legal or economic instability in the foreign markets in which we do business, which could influence our ability to sell our products in these international markets; 18 restrictions on the transfer of funds between the United States and foreign jurisdictions; and the ability of our international licensees and distributors to locate and continue to open desirable new retail locations. Our imports are limited by textile agreements between the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, most notably China. These agreements impose quotas on the amounts and types of merchandise that may be imported into the United States from these countries. These agreements also allow the United States to limit the importation of categories of merchandise that are not now subject to specified limits. The United States and the countries in which our products are produced or sold may also, from time to time, impose new quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions, or adversely adjust prevailing quota, duty or tariff levels. If we are unable to obtain our raw materials and finished apparel from the countries where we wish to purchase them, either because of capacity constraints or visa availability under the required quota category or for any other reason, or if the cost of doing so should increase, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Domestic and foreign currency fluctuations could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. We generally purchase our products in U.S. dollars. However, we source most of our products overseas. As a result, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the applicable currencies. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency denominated prices at which our international businesses sell products. Furthermore, our international sales and some of our licensing revenue is generally derived from sales in foreign currencies, including the Canadian Dollar and the Euro. This revenue, when translated into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes, could be materially affected by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, negatively impacting our results of operations and the Company's ability to generate revenue growth. Furthermore, since some of our hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility of fluctuating exchange rates, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the values of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. In addition, while the hedges are designed to reduce volatility over the forward contract period, these contracts can create volatility during the period. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities. See also "Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements" and "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." A significant disruption at our Louisville, Kentucky distribution center or our other international distribution facilities could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results. We primarily rely on a single distribution center located in Louisville, Kentucky to receive, store and distribute merchandise to all of our stores and wholesale customers in the U.S. We also operate a distribution center in Canada, utilize two independent distributors with four locations and one Company operated location in Italy which service Europe, and utilize three contract warehouses in Hong Kong, China and Korea that service the Pacific Rim. Any significant interruption in the operation of our Kentucky distribution center or any of our other foreign facilities due to natural disasters, accidents, system failures or other unforeseen causes could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Our two most senior executive officers own a significant percentage of our common stock. Their interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. Maurice Marciano and Paul Marciano, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, respectively, collectively beneficially own over 38% of our outstanding shares of common stock. These individuals may have different interests than our other stockholders and, accordingly, they may direct the 19 operations of our business in a manner contrary to the interests of our other stockholders. As long as these individuals own a significant percentage of our common stock, they may effectively be able to: elect our directors; amend or prevent amendment of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws; effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and control the outcome of any other matter submitted to our stockholders for vote. Their stock ownership, together with the anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of applicable Delaware law and our Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, may discourage acquisition bids or allow the Marcianos to delay or prevent a change in control that may be favored by our other stockholders, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our common stock price. Our failure to attract and retain our existing senior management team and other key personnel could adversely affect our business. Our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization in order to ensure the timely delivery of desirable merchandise in appropriate quantities to our stores and our wholesalers' stores. This execution requires experienced and talented management in design, production, merchandising and advertising. Our success depends upon the personal efforts and abilities of our senior management, particularly Maurice Marciano and Paul Marciano, and other key personnel. Although we believe we have a strong management team with relevant industry expertise, the extended loss of the services of one or both of the Marcianos or other key personnel could materially harm our business. Although we are the beneficiary of a $10 million "key man" insurance policy on the life of Paul Marciano, we do not have any other "key man" insurance with respect to either of the Marcianos or other key employees, and any of them may leave us at any time, which could severely disrupt our business and future operating results. Fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations, comparable store sales, sales per square foot, wholesale operations or royalty net revenue or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our stock price. Our quarterly results of operations for our individual stores, our wholesale operations and our royalty net revenue have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to fluctuate in the future. Further, if our retail store expansion plans, both domestically and internationally, fail to meet our expected results, our overhead and other related expansion costs would increase without an offsetting increase in sales and net revenue. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our net revenue and operating results have historically been lower in the first half of our fiscal year due to general seasonal trends in the apparel and retail industries. The Company recently changed its fiscal year to the end of January but expects the historical trend described above to continue. Our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations are affected by a variety of factors, including: shifts in consumer tastes and fashion trends; the timing of new store openings and the relative proportion of new stores to mature stores; calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods; the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments; changes in our merchandise mix; changes in our mix of revenues by segment; the timing of promotional events; 20 actions by competitors; weather conditions; changes in style; changes in the business environment; population trends; changes in patterns of commerce such as the expansion of electronic commerce; and the level of pre-operating expenses associated with new stores. An unfavorable change in any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our stock price. Violation of labor laws and practices by our licensees or suppliers could harm our business. We require our licensing partners and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices, we do not control our licensees or suppliers or their labor practices. The violation of labor or other laws by any of our licensees or suppliers, or divergence of a licensee's or supplier's labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, harm the value of our trademarks, damage our reputation or expose us to potential liability for their wrongdoings. We rely on third parties and our own personnel for upgrading and maintaining our management information systems. If these parties do not perform these functions appropriately, our business could be disrupted and adversely impacted. The efficient operation of our business is very dependent on our information systems. In particular, we rely heavily on the merchandise management and ERP systems used to track sales and inventory and manage our supply chain. We depend on our vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade these systems to support our business as we expand. The software programs supporting the processing of our inventory management information are licensed to us by independent software developers. The inability of these developers to continue to maintain and upgrade our software programs could result in incorrect information being supplied to management, inefficient ordering and replenishment of products and disruption of our operations. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the business. Significant expenditures could be required to remediate any such failure, problem or breach. The Company could experience liquidity issues associated with its cash balances in excess of FDIC insurance limits held by various financial institutions and its significant investment of excess cash in a single municipal money market fund. Cash used primarily for working capital purposes is maintained with various major financial institutions in amounts which are in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. In addition, excess cash and cash equivalents, which represent the majority of our outstanding cash and cash equivalents balance, are held primarily in one diversified municipal money market fund. Although the fund, which is rated AAA by Fitch, is comprised of high-quality, liquid instruments, if the financial markets trading the underlying assets in this fund experience a disruption, the Company may need to temporarily rely on other forms of liquidity, including borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
