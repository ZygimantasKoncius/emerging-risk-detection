ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ------------ - THE COMPANY OPERATES IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WHERE MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS ARE LARGER WITH FAR GREATER RESOURCES. Please see the caption "Competition" on this page above for a complete discussion of this risk factor. - THE COMPANY, THROUGH ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, REQUIRES COLLATERAL FROM ITS INSUREDS COVERING THE INSUREDS' OBLIGATIONS FOR SELF-INSURED RETENTIONS OR DEDUCTIBLES RELATED TO POLICIES OF INSURANCE PROVIDED. SHOULD THE COMPANY, AS SURETY, BECOME RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH INSURED OBLIGATIONS, THE COLLATERAL HELD MAY PROVE TO BE INSUFFICIENT. For further discussion regarding this risk factor, see Note M to the consolidated financial statements on page 53 of this Form 10-K. - THE COMPANY LIMITS ITS RISK TO LOSS FROM POLICIES OF INSURANCE ISSUED BY ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF REINSURANCE COVERAGE FROM OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES. SUCH REINSURANCE DOES NOT RELIEVE THE COMPANY FROM ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO POLICYHOLDERS SHOULD THE REINSURERS BE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO THE COMPANY UNDER THE TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. For further discussion regarding this risk factor, see the caption REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE and Notes F and M to the consolidated financial statements on pages 26, 46 and 53, respectively, of this Form 10-K. - OPERATING IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO LOSS FROM POLICIES OF INSURANCE ISSUED TO ITS POLICYHOLDERS. A LARGE PORTION OF LOSSES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY ARE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE LOSS PAYMENTS TO BE MADE. SUCH ESTIMATES OF FUTURE LOSS PAYMENTS MAY PROVE TO BE INADEQUATE. For further discussion of this risk factor, see the caption PROPERTY/CASUALTY LOSSES AND 17 LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES beginning on page 3, the caption Loss and Loss Expense Reserves beginning on page 27 and Note C to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page 43. All pages referenced are within this Form 10-K. - THE COMPANY DERIVES APPROXIMATELY 28% OF ITS DIRECT PREMIUM VOLUME FROM A SINGLE MAJOR CUSTOMER AND ITS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. LOSS OF THIS MAJOR CUSTOMER WOULD SEVERELY REDUCE THE COMPANY'S REVENUE AND EARNINGS POTENTIAL. For further discussion regarding this risk factor, see Notes K and M to the consolidated financial statements beginning on pages 50 and 53, respectively, of this Form 10-K. - GIVEN THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, A DROP IN INTEREST RATES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS. For further discussion regarding this risk factor, see the caption Market Risk beginning on page 29 of this Form 10-K. - THE COMPANY OPERATES IN A REGULATED INDUSTRY. Changes in laws and regulations governing the insurance industry could have a significant impact on the Company's ability to generate income from its insurance company operations.
