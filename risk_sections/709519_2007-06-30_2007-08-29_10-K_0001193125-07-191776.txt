ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, the loss of our competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced revenues, reduced margins, reduced levels of profitability and loss of market share. We compete in the computer systems (hardware and software) and storage (hardware and software) products and services markets. These markets are intensely competitive. If we fail to compete successfully in these markets, the demand for our products and services would decrease. Any reduction in demand could lead to fewer customer orders, reduced revenues, pricing pressures, reduced margins, reduced levels of profitability and loss of market share. These competitive pressures could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Our competitors are some of the largest, most successful companies in the world. They include IBM, Dell, HP, EMC, Fujitsu, HDS, the Fujitsu-Siemens joint venture, Microsoft and Intel. We compete with (i) systems manufacturers and resellers of systems based on microprocessors from Intel, the Windows family of operating systems software from Microsoft and the Linux family of operating systems software from Red Hat and others, as well as (ii) companies that focus on providing support and maintenance services for computer systems and storage products. Certain of these competitors compete aggressively on price and seek to maintain very low cost structures. Some of these competitors are seeking to increase their market share, which creates increased pressure, including pricing pressure, on our product lines and service offerings. In particular, we are seeing increased competition and pricing pressures from competitors offering systems running Linux software and other open source software, as well as competitors offering support services. In addition, certain of our competitors, including IBM and HP, have financial and human resources that are substantially greater than ours, which increases the competitive pressures we face. These competitors also have significant installed bases, and it can be very difficult to win a new customer that has made significant investments in a competitors platform. Customers make buying decisions based on many factors, including among other things, new product and service offerings and features; product performance and quality; availability and quality of support and other services; price; platform; interoperability with hardware and software of other vendors; quality; reliability, security features and availability of products; breadth of product line; ease of doing business; a vendors ability to adapt to customers changing requirements; responsiveness to shifts in the marketplace; business model (e.g., utility computing, subscription-based software usage, consolidation versus outsourcing); contractual terms and conditions; vendor reputation and vendor viability. As competition increases, each factor on which we compete becomes more important and the lack of competitive advantage with respect to one or more of these factors could lead to a loss of competitive position, resulting in fewer customer orders, reduced revenues, reduced margins, reduced levels of profitability and loss of market share. We expect competitive pressure to remain intense. Fujitsu and its subsidiaries have, for many years, been key strategic channel partners for Sun, distributing substantial quantities of our products throughout the world. We entered into a number of agreements with Fujitsu intended to substantially increase the scope of our relationship with them, including through collaborative selling efforts and joint development and marketing of server products known as the Advanced Product Line (APL). The first group of APL server products was released in April 2007 and branded as the SPARC Enterprise line of servers. However, Fujitsu is also a competitor of Sun and, as a licensee of various technologies from Sun and others, it has developed products that currently compete directly with our products. Over the last several years, we have invested significantly in our Storage products business, including through the acquisition of StorageTek, with a view to increasing the sales of these products both on a stand-alone basis to customers using the systems of our competitors, and as part of the systems that we sell. The Storage products business is intensely competitive. EMC is currently a leader in the storage products market and our primary competitor. We are continuing the implementation of a solution-based selling approach. While we believe that strategy will enable us to increase our revenues and margins, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this approach. In fact, our implementation of this selling model may result in reductions in our revenues and/or margins, particularly in the short term, as we compete to attract business. In addition, if our emphasis on solution-based sales increases, we face strong competition from systems integrators such as IBM, Fujitsu-Siemens and HP. Our inability to successfully implement this model would have a material adverse impact on our revenues and margins. We maintain higher research and development costs, as a percentage of total net revenues, than many of our competitors and our earnings are dependent upon maintaining revenues and gross margins at a sufficient level to offset these costs. One of our business strategies is to derive a competitive advantage and a resulting enhancement of our gross margins from our investment in innovative new technologies which customers value. As a result, as a percentage of total net revenues, we incur 11 Table of Contents higher fixed R&D costs than many of our competitors. To the extent that we are unable to develop and sell products with attractive gross margins in sufficient volumes, our earnings may be materially and adversely affected by our cost structure. We continue to add new products to our entry-level server product line that are offered at a lower price point and that may provide us with a lower gross margin percentage than our products as a whole. Although our strategy is to sell these products as part of overall systems that include other products with higher gross margin percentages, to the extent that the mix of our overall revenues represented by sales of lower gross margin products increases, our gross margins and earnings may be materially and adversely affected. The products we make are very complex. If we are unable to rapidly and successfully develop and introduce new products and manage our inventory, we will not be able to satisfy customer demand. We operate in a highly competitive, quickly changing environment, and our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products that our customers choose to buy. If we are unable to develop new products, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. We must quickly develop, introduce, and deliver in quantity new, complex systems, software, and hardware products and components. These include products that incorporate certain UltraSPARC microprocessors and the Solaris operating system, the Java platform, Sun Java System portfolio and Sun N1 Grid architecture, among others. The development process for these complicated products is very uncertain. It requires high levels of innovation from both our product designers and the suppliers of the components used in our products. The development process is also lengthy and costly. If we fail to accurately anticipate our customers needs and technological trends, or are otherwise unable to complete the development of a product on a timely basis, we will be unable to introduce new products into the market on a timely basis, if at all, and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. The manufacture and introduction of our new products is also a complicated process. Once we have developed a new product, we face several challenges in the manufacturing process. We must be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes so that we can have an adequate supply of new products to meet customer demand. We must also be able to manufacture the new products at acceptable costs. This requires us to be able to accurately forecast customer demand so that we can procure the appropriate components at optimal costs. Forecasting demand requires us to predict order volumes, the correct mix of our products, and the correct configurations of these products. We must manage new product introductions and transitions to minimize the impact of customer-delayed purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product releases. We must also try to reduce the levels of older product and component inventories to minimize inventory write-offs. If we have excess inventory, it may be necessary to reduce our prices or write down inventory, which could result in lower gross margins. Additionally, our customers may delay orders for existing products in anticipation of new product introductions. As a result, we may decide to adjust prices of our existing products during this process to try to increase customer demand for these products. Our future operating results would be materially and adversely affected if such pricing adjustments were to occur and we were unable to mitigate the resulting margin pressure by maintaining a favorable mix of systems, software, service and other products, or if we were unsuccessful in achieving component cost reductions, operating efficiencies and increasing sales volumes. If we are unable to timely develop, manufacture, and introduce new products in sufficient quantity to meet customer demand at acceptable costs, or if we are unable to correctly anticipate customer demand for our new and existing products, our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected. We face numerous risks associated with our strategic alliance with Fujitsu. We have entered into a number of agreements with Fujitsu with respect to collaborative sales and marketing efforts and the joint development and manufacturing of server products known as the Advanced Product Line (APL). The first group of APL server products was released in April 2007 and branded as the Sun SPARC Enterprise line of servers. The APL server products are intended to eventually replace a portion of our server product portfolio. In addition, the agreements contemplate that Sun and Fujitsu dedicate substantial financial and human resources to this relationship. As a result, our future performance and financial condition may be impacted by the success or failure of this relationship. Joint development and marketing of a complex new product line is an inherently difficult undertaking and is subject to numerous risks. If we fail to satisfy certain development or supply obligations under the agreements, or if we otherwise violate the terms of the agreements, we may be subject to significant contractual or legal penalties. Further, if Fujitsu encounters any of a number of potential problems in its business, such as intellectual property infringement claims, supply difficulties, or difficulties in meeting development milestones or financial challenges, these problems could impact our strategic relationship with them and could result in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. There can be no assurance that our strategic relationship with Fujitsu will be successful or that the economic terms of the agreements establishing the relationship will ultimately prove to be favorable to us. If any of these risks come to pass, they may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 12 Table of Contents We have licensed significant elements of our intellectual property, including our Solaris operating system and Java technology, as open source software and intend to license additional intellectual property in the future under open source licenses, which could reduce the competitive advantage we derive from this intellectual property. We have released significant elements of our intellectual property, including the Solaris operating system, the Java Enterprise System infrastructure software platform, the Sun N1 Management software and various developer tools, to the open source development community as open source software under an open source license and have made the hardware source code of our UltraSPARC T1 processor available under an open source license. We have also released our Java SE, Java EE and Java ME technologies under an open source license. Although open source licensing models vary, generally open source software licenses permit the liberal copying, modification and distribution of a software program allowing a diverse programming community to contribute to the software. As a result of such release, there could be an impact on revenue related to this intellectual property, and we may no longer be able to exercise control over some aspects of the future development of this intellectual property. In particular, the feature set and functionality of the Solaris operating system may diverge from those that best serve our strategic objectives, move in directions in which we do not have competitive expertise or fork into multiple, potentially incompatible variations. We currently derive a significant competitive advantage from our development, licensing and sale of the Solaris operating system, Java technologies, and system products based on the UltraSPARC family of microprocessors, and any of these events could reduce our competitive advantage or impact market demand for our products, software and services. In addition, disclosing the content of our source code could limit the intellectual property protection we can obtain or maintain for that source code or the products containing that source code and could facilitate intellectual property infringement claims against Sun. Our reliance on single source suppliers could delay product shipments and increase our costs. Most of the our products and components are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. Further, there are some components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology or other business constraints. For example, we currently depend on Texas Instruments for the manufacture of our UltraSPARC microprocessors, AMD for Opteron processors and several other companies for custom integrated circuits. If we were unable to purchase on acceptable terms or experienced significant delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary parts and/or components from a particular vendor and we had to find a new supplier for these parts and components, our new and existing product shipments could be delayed which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. Our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of components to meet the demands of our customers. We depend heavily on our suppliers to design, develop, manufacture, and deliver on a timely basis the necessary components for our products. While many of the components we purchase are standard, we do purchase some components (standard or otherwise), including color monitors, custom power supplies, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and custom memory and graphics devices, that require long lead times to manufacture and deliver. Long lead times make it difficult for us to plan and procure appropriate component inventory levels to meet the customer demand for our products. In addition, in the past, we have experienced shortages in certain of our components (including, ASICs, dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) and static random access memories (SRAMs)). If a component delivery from a supplier is delayed, if we experience a shortage in one or more components, or if we are unable to provide for adequate levels of component inventory, our new and existing product shipments could be delayed and our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Because we may order components from suppliers in advance of receipt of customer orders for our products that include these components, we could face a material inventory risk. As part of our component planning, we place orders with or pay certain suppliers for components in advance of receipt of customer orders. We occasionally negotiate supply commitments with vendors early in the manufacturing process of our microprocessors to make sure we have enough of these components for our products to meet anticipated customer demand. Because the design and manufacturing process for these components is very complicated it is possible that we could experience a design or manufacturing flaw that could delay or even prevent the production of the components for which we have previously committed to pay or need to fulfill orders from customers. We also face the risk of ordering too many components, or conversely, not enough components, since supply orders are generally based on forecasts of customer orders rather than actual customer orders. In addition, in some cases, we make non-cancelable order commitments to our suppliers for work-in-progress, suppliers finished goods, custom sub-assemblies and Sun unique raw materials that are necessary to meet our lead times for finished goods. If we cannot change or be released from supply orders, we could incur costs from the purchase of unusable components, either due to a delay in the production of the components or other supplies or as a result of inaccurately predicting 13 Table of Contents supply orders in advance of customer orders. Our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected as a result of these increased costs. Delays in product development or customer acceptance and implementation of new products and technologies could seriously harm our business. Generally, the computer systems we sell to customers incorporate various hardware and software products that we sell, such as UltraSPARC microprocessors, various software elements, from the Solaris operating system to the Java platform, Sun Java System portfolio, Sun N1 Grid, the Sun StorageTek SL8500 modular library system and Sun StorEdge array products. Any delay in the development, delivery or acceptance of key elements of the hardware or software included in our systems could delay our shipment of these systems. Delays in the development and introduction of our products may occur for various reasons. In addition, if customers decided to delay the adoption and implementation of new releases of our Solaris operating system, this could also delay customer acceptance of new hardware products tied to that release. Implementing a new release of an operating environment requires a great deal of time and money for a customer to convert its systems to the new release. The customer must also work with software vendors who port their software applications to the new operating system and make sure these applications will run on the new operating system. As a result, customers may decide to delay their adoption of a new release of an operating system because of the cost of a new system and the effort involved to implement it. Such delays in product development and customer acceptance and implementation of new products could materially and adversely affect our business. Our products may have quality issues that could adversely affect our sales and reputation. In the course of conducting our business, we experience and address quality issues. Some of our hardware and software products contain defects, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products, which may be beyond our control. Often defects are identified during our design, development and manufacturing processes and we are able to correct many of these. Sometimes defects are identified after introduction and shipment of new products or enhancements to existing products. When a quality issue is identified, we work extensively with our customers (and our suppliers) to remedy such issues. We may test the affected product to determine the root cause of the problem and to determine appropriate solutions. We may find an appropriate solution (often called a patch) or offer a temporary fix while a permanent solution is being determined. If we are unable to determine the root cause, find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix, we may delay shipment to customers. We may, however, ship products while we continue to explore a suitable solution if we believe the defect is not significant to the products functionality. Defects in our products can harm our reputation, delay or prevent sales, result in significant expense and could materially and adversely affect our business. Our international customers and operations subject us to a number of risks. Currently, more than half of our revenues come from international sales. In addition, a portion of our operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities outside of the U.S. Our ability to sell our products and conduct our operations internationally is subject to a number of risks. Local economic, political and labor conditions in each country could adversely affect demand for our products and services or disrupt our operations in these markets. We may also experience reduced intellectual property protection or longer and more challenging collection cycles as a result of different customary business practices in certain countries where we do business which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial results. Currency fluctuations could also materially and adversely affect our business in a number of ways. Although we take steps to reduce or eliminate certain foreign currency exposures that can be identified or quantified, we may incur currency translation losses as a result of our international operations. Further, in the event that currency fluctuations cause our products to become more expensive in overseas markets in local currencies, there could be a reduction in demand for our products or we could lower our pricing in some or all of these markets resulting in reduced revenue and margins. Alternatively, a weakening dollar could result in greater costs to us for our overseas operations. Changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business in these jurisdictions. Trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements subject us to additional regulation and may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market, and increase our operating costs. In addition, we could be subject to regulations, fines and penalties for violations of import and export regulations. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such United States laws may be customary, will not take actions in violations of our policies. These violations could result in penalties, including prohibiting us from exporting our products to one or more countries, and could materially and adversely affect our business. Moreover, local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the U.S. We incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if 14 Table of Contents we do not comply with local laws and regulations, which may be substantially different from those in the United States. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common for local business people to engage in business practices that violate their local laws and that are prohibited by United States laws applicable to us such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we implement policies, training, and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, as well as our resellers and those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such United States laws may be common, will not engage in actions which violate the law or our policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We intend to enter into one or more joint ventures with distribution partners with the goal of increasing sales of Suns products and services in selected geographic markets. Forming a joint venture will subject us to additional compliance and legal risks related to the actions of the joint venture partner. We are currently implementing a new enterprise resource planning system, and problems with the design or implementation of this system could interfere with our business and operations. We have commenced a project to consolidate all of our database infrastructure to a single global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of the ERP system, which may be disruptive to our underlying business. Any disruptions or delays in the design and implementation of the new ERP system, particularly any disruptions or delays that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, bill and track our customers, fulfill contractual obligations, file SEC reports in a timely manner and otherwise run our business. Further, as we are dependent upon our ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information to key decision makers, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected if our database infrastructure does not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time. Even if we do encounter these adverse effects, the design and implementation of the new ERP system may be much more costly than we anticipated. If we are unable to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Failure to successfully implement our global resourcing activities could adversely affect our results of operations. We continuously seek to make our cost structure more efficient and focus on our core strengths. We continue to develop and implement our global resourcing strategy and operating model which includes activities that are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability, and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging external talent and skills worldwide. We rely on partners or third party service providers for the provision of certain key business process functions, including IT services and the human resources function, and as a result, we may incur increased business continuity risks. We may no longer be able to exercise control over some aspects of the future development, support or maintenance of outsourced operations and processes, including the internal controls associated with those outsourced business operations and processes, which could adversely affect our business. If we are unable to effectively develop and implement our resourcing strategy due to, among other things, data protection, contract and regulatory compliance issues, we may not realize cost structure efficiencies and our operating and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. Given the uncertainty in forecasting and other variables, actual financial impact from outsourcing may materially differ from our projections. In addition, if we are unable to effectively utilize or integrate and interoperate with external resources or if our partners or third party service providers experience business difficulties or are unable to provide business process services as anticipated, we may need to seek alternative service providers or resume providing these business processes internally, which could be costly and time consuming and have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results. We also rely on partners for the provision of key manufacturing activities. Recently, Texas Instruments indicated publicly that it will not be making UltraSPARC microprocessors for Sun on a foundry basis at the 45-nm node. Consequently, we are reviewing alternative foundry solutions, and are considering plans to transition the 45-nm mode foundry operations and supply chain to other potential vendors. If we are unable to effectively execute the transition, we may experience difficulty in delivering our 45-nm next generation microelectronics products and technologies, which could materially and adversely affect our business. We expect our quarterly revenues, cash flows and operating results to fluctuate for a number of reasons. Future operating results and cash flows will continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations based on a wide variety of factors, including: Seasonality. Although our sales and other operating results can be influenced by a number of factors and historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results, our sequential quarterly operating results generally fluctuate downward in the first and third quarters of each fiscal year when compared with the immediately preceding quarter. 15 Table of Contents Linearity. Our quarterly sales have historically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of such quarters total revenues occur in the last month of the quarter. This pattern can make prediction of revenues, earnings and working capital for each financial period difficult and uncertain and increase the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. Foreign Currency Fluctuations. As a large portion of our business takes place outside of the U.S., we enter into transactions in other currencies. Although we employ various hedging strategies, we are exposed to changes in exchange rates, which cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. Deferred Tax Assets. Estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from net operating losses, tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. In determining future taxable income, we are responsible for the assumptions utilized including the amount of state, federal and international pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. Cumulative losses incurred in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions in recent years and insufficient forecasted future taxable income in certain other foreign jurisdictions represented sufficient negative evidence to require full and partial valuation allowances in these jurisdictions. We have established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions, which will remain until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal. Future reversals or increases to our valuation allowance could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We perform an analysis on our goodwill balances to test for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events occur that may indicate impairment possibly exists. Goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value. The impairment of a long-lived intangible asset is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying value of the intangible asset we are testing for impairment. If the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then we must write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value. We recognized an impairment charge of $70 million related to acquired intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. As of June 30, 2007, we had a goodwill balance of $2,514 million. Going forward, we will continue to review our goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment. Any additional impairment charges could adversely affect our future earnings. Income tax laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenues and expenses in different jurisdictions. Additionally, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are regularly subject to audits by tax authorities. While we endeavor to comply with all applicable income tax laws, there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law than we do or that we will comply in all respects with applicable tax laws, which could result in additional taxes. We regularly review the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax audits to determine if additional income taxes, penalties and interest would be assessed. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these audits will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period for which the review is made. We are dependent on significant customers, specific industries and geographies. In January 2007, Access Distribution, the largest distributor of our products, was sold to Avnet, Inc. by General Electric Company (the Acquisition). Sales to Avnet and Access Distribution accounted for approximately 11%, 11%, and 13% of net revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Avnet, which was StorageTeks largest distributor, became a distributor of Sun products after our acquisition of StorageTek in August 2005. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues. The Acquisition may be disruptive to Avnets business and could, consequently, adversely impact our business. Moreover, if our distribution arrangement with Avnet significantly deteriorates or is terminated, and we are unable to find another distributor for our products on similar financial terms, our future operating results could be adversely affected. 16 Table of Contents We also depend on the telecommunications, financial services and government sectors for a significant portion of our revenues. Our revenues are dependent on the level of technology capital spending in the U.S. and international economies. If capital spending declines in these industries over an extended period of time, our business will continue to be materially and adversely affected. We continue to execute on our strategy to reduce our dependence on these industries by expanding our product reach into new industries, but no assurance can be given that this strategy will be successful. Weakening economic conditions in specific geographic areas, particularly the United States or Europe, can also adversely affect our operating results. We are dependent upon our channel partners for a significant portion of our revenues. Our channel partners include distributors, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), independent software vendors, system integrators, service providers and resellers. We continue to see an increase in revenues via our reseller channel. We face ongoing business risks due to our reliance on our channel partners to maintain customer relationships and create customer demand with customers where we have a limited or no direct relationship. Should our relationships with our channel partners or their effectiveness decline, we face risk of declining demand which could affect our results of operations. Adverse resolution of litigation may harm our operating results or financial condition. We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. We are currently involved in litigation with the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Department of Energy (DOE). Additional information is provided in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Our business may suffer if it is alleged or found that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. From time to time we have been notified that we may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, result in costly litigation, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. There are often several pending claims in various stages of evaluation at any particular time. From time to time, we consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these claims. No assurance can be given that licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products, or a successful claim of infringement against us requiring us to pay royalties to a third party, and we fail to license such technology on acceptable terms and conditions or to develop or license a substitute technology, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our acquisition, divestiture and alliance activities could disrupt our ongoing business and subject us to significant risks. We expect to continue to make investments in companies, products, and technologies, either through acquisitions or investments or alliances. For example, we have purchased several companies in the past, including StorageTek and SeeBeyond, and have also formed alliances, such as our strategic relationship with Fujitsu for the development, manufacturing and marketing of server products and our OEM relationship with Hitachi Data Systems for the collaboration on, and delivery of, a broad range of storage products and services. We also rely on IT services partners and independent software developers to enhance the value to our customers of our products and services. Acquisitions and alliance activities often involve risks, including: (1) difficulty in assimilating the acquired operations and employees; (2) difficulty in managing product co-development activities with our alliance partners; (3) retaining the key employees of the acquired operation; (4) disruption of our or the acquired companys ongoing business; (5) inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies, and procedures; and (6) lacking the experience to enter into new product or technology markets. In addition, from time to time, our competitors acquire or enter into exclusive arrangements with companies with whom we do business or may do business in the future. Reductions in the number of partners with whom we may do business in a particular context may reduce our ability to enter into critical alliances on attractive terms or at all, and the termination of an existing alliance by a business partner may disrupt our operations. From time to time, we evaluate our products and service offerings and may adjust our strategic priorities by reducing investment in or divesting certain business operations. Decisions to eliminate or divest certain business operations may involve a number of risks, including the diversion of managements attention, significant costs and expenses, the assumption of contractual obligations, realization of losses, facility consolidation, the loss or disruption of customer relationships, the loss of employees, the elimination of revenues along with associated costs and the disruption of operations in the affected business or related businesses, any of which could cause our operating results to decline and may fail to yield the expected benefits. 17 Table of Contents We may be materially affected by a decrease in demand for our tape products or by an inability to maintain key competitive advantages in tape. As a result of the acquisition of StorageTek, a significant portion of Storage products revenue is generated by sales of our tape products. If overall demand for tape storage products declines, or if we lose significant market share in tape, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. One of the key competitive advantages that our tape products have over competing disk products is that tape products store data at a fraction of the price of disk storage. The price of disk storage continues to decrease rapidly due to competition and decreasing manufacturing costs. We must continue to develop and introduce new tape products that reduce the cost of tape storage at a rate that is similar to or greater than the decline in disk storage costs in order to maintain this competitive advantage. For a discussion of risk associated with new products, see The products we make are very complex. If we are unable to rapidly and successfully develop and introduce new products and manage our inventory, we will not be able to satisfy customer demand, above. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to reduce the price of our tape products at a rate similar to the decline in disk storage costs. Credit rating downgrades could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Three credit rating agencies follow Sun. Fitch Ratings has rated us BBB-, which is an investment grade rating. Moodys Investor Services and Standard & Poors have assigned us non-investment grade ratings of Ba1 and BB+, respectively. All three credit rating agencies have placed us on stable outlook. These ratings reflect those credit agencies expectations that the intense competitive environment facing Sun in its core markets will continue to challenge our revenue and profitability, at least over the near term. If we were to be downgraded by these ratings agencies, such downgrades could increase our costs of obtaining, or make it more difficult to obtain or issue, new debt financing. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. We depend on key employees and face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees. Our employees are vital to our success, and our key management, engineering, and other employees are difficult to replace. We generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees. Further, we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees. Because our compensation packages include equity-based incentives, pressure on our stock price could affect our ability to offer competitive compensation packages to current employees. In addition, we must continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals, which may be difficult due to morale challenges posed by our workforce reductions, global resourcing strategies and related uncertainties. Should these conditions continue, we may not be able to retain highly qualified employees in the future which could adversely affect our business. Our use of a self-insurance program to cover certain claims for losses suffered and costs or expenses incurred could negatively impact our business upon the occurrence of an uninsured event. We maintain a program of insurance with third-party insurers for certain property, casualty and other risks. The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis. We retain risk with regard to certain loss events, such as California earthquakes, the indemnification or defense payments we, as a company, may make to or on behalf of our directors and officers as a result of obligations under applicable agreements, our by-laws and applicable law, and for potential liabilities that are not insured, and we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. The types and amounts of insurance obtained vary from time to time and from location to location, depending on availability, cost, and our decisions with respect to risk retention. In the event that the frequency of losses experienced by us increased unexpectedly, the aggregate of such losses could materially increase our liability and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, because the insurance market continues to limit the availability of certain insurance products and because the costs of certain products continue to increase, we will continue to evaluate the types and magnitudes of claims we include in our self-insurance program. Additions and changes to this self insurance program may increase our risk exposure and therefore increase the risk of a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, we have made certain judgments as to the limits on our existing insurance coverage that we believe are in line with industry standards, as well as in light of economic and product availability considerations. Unforeseen catastrophic loss scenarios could prove our limits to be inadequate, and losses incurred in connection with the known claims we self-insure could be substantial. Either of these circumstances could materially adversely affect our financial and business condition. Business interruptions could adversely affect our business. Our operations and those of our suppliers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control. A substantial portion of our facilities, including our corporate 18 Table of Contents headquarters and other critical business operations, are located near major earthquake faults. In addition, some of our facilities are located on filled land and, therefore, may be more susceptible to damage if an earthquake occurs. We generally do not carry earthquake insurance for direct earthquake-related losses. In addition, we do not carry business interruption insurance for, nor do we carry financial reserves against, business interruptions arising from earthquakes or certain other events. If a business interruption occurs, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our failure to comply with contractual obligations may result in significant penalties. We offer terms to some of our distributors and other customers that, in some cases, include complex provisions for pricing, data protection and other terms. In connection with these contracts, we are in some cases required to allow the customer to audit certain of our records to verify compliance with these terms. In particular, government agency customers audit and investigate government contractors, including us. These agencies review our performance under the applicable contracts as well as compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The government also may review the adequacy of, and our compliance with, contractual obligations, our internal control systems and policies, including our purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, management information systems and data protection requirements. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to claims for damages, penalties and other sanctions. With respect to claims by government agencies, sanctions may include treble damages, fines and possibly debarment or suspension from sales to the federal government. In addition, we may suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us. The federal government has intervened in a case filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas alleging that Sun has violated the Federal False Claims and Anti-Kickback Acts and breached our contracts with the General Services Administration (GSA), among other claims. These claims are based in part on certain audit reports prepared by the GSA Office of the Inspector General with respect to our prior GSA Multi-Award Schedule. Claims by the federal government pursuant to the lawsuit or otherwise in the administration of our contracts, and any judgment or settlement related thereto, could expose us to damages, penalties and other sanctions, up to and including debarment or suspension from federal sales, loss of sales opportunities, business interruption and damage to our reputation. Some of our Restructuring Plans may not result in the anticipated cost saving and benefits. Since March 2004, our Board of Directors and our management have approved a series of restructuring plans including the restructuring plan announced on August 1, 2007. Our ability to achieve the cost savings and operating efficiencies anticipated by these restructuring plans is dependent on our ability to effectively implement the workforce and excess capacity reductions contemplated. If we are unable to implement these initiatives effectively, we may not achieve the level of cost savings and efficiency benefits expected for fiscal 2008 and beyond. Commercial real estate market conditions could affect our ability to sublease properties in our portfolio. We implemented facility exit plans in each of the last six fiscal years as part of our ongoing efforts to consolidate excess facilities. The commercial real estate market conditions in the United States and in many of the countries in which we have significant leased properties have resulted in a surplus of business facilities making it difficult to sublease properties. We may be unable to sublease our excess properties, or we may not meet our expected estimated levels of sublease income, and, accordingly, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Environmental laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs. Some of our operations are subject to state, federal, and international laws governing protection of the environment, human health and safety, and regulating the use of certain chemical substances. We endeavor to comply with these environmental laws, yet compliance with such laws could increase our operations and product costs; increase the complexities of product design, development, procurement, and manufacture; limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory; limit our sales activities; and impact our future financial results. Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties, and possible prohibition of sales of our products into one or more states or countries, and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Currently, a significant portion of our revenues come from international sales. Recent environmental legislation within the European Union (EU), including the EU Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our revenues from EU countries as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. In addition, similar environmental legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including the U.S. (under federal and state laws), China, Japan, Canada, Korea and certain Latin American countries, the cumulative impact of which 19 Table of Contents could be significant. We are committed to offering products that are environmentally responsible and to complying with any current or future laws protecting the environment, human health and safety. We may not realize the economic return expected from the acquired in-process research and development (IPRD). During fiscal 2006, we recorded total in-process research and development expense of $60 million related to our acquisitions of StorageTek and SeeBeyond. At the time of the acquisitions, we believed there was a reasonable chance of realizing the economic return expected from the acquired in-process technology. However, as there is risk associated with the realization of benefits related to commercialization of an in-process project due to rapidly changing customer needs, the complexity of technology, and growing competitive pressures, there can be no assurance that any project will meet commercial success. We continue to make substantial progress related to the development and commercialization of acquired technologies. With respect to StorageTek and SeeBeyond, key product releases and major enhancements contemplated by acquired IPRD projects were completed for all significant projects during FY06, with the exception of VSM Open solution which is scheduled for release during Q3 FY2008. In addition, ongoing feature and function enhancements on all of our acquired IPRD projects are expected to continue for several more years. Although we have experienced delays in the completion of certain of our development efforts and their related commercialization, the expected total costs to complete such technologies have not materially increased, individually or in the aggregate, from our estimates at the time of the acquisitions. However, failure to successfully commercialize an in-process project, or unanticipated costs to complete such technologies, would result in the loss of the expected economic return inherent in the fair value allocation. Additionally, the value of our intangible assets may become impaired. Our ongoing restructuring plans may also impact the expected economic return from acquired in-process technology. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, as a result of our Phase VI restructuring activities, we exited certain StorageTek product lines comprising $9 million of the total $49 million assigned to IPRD as of the acquisition date. Future economic benefits for these IPRD projects will not be realized. Our business may suffer if it is alleged or found that we or our contractors have violated data privacy or confidentiality obligations. Compliance with a variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations related to data privacy, as well as various contractual obligations related to confidentiality, increase our cost of doing business. Such obligations include regulations related to the protection of various types of data and information, such as personal healthcare information, personally identifiable information and other confidential information. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these obligations, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violations of our policies. Further, our ability to comply with these obligations may depend upon future investments in systems and processes, and such investments may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to comply with these obligations, or even allegations that we have failed to comply with these obligations, may also cause a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. Our stock price can be volatile. Our stock price, like that of other technology companies, continues to be volatile. For example, our stock price can be affected by many factors such as quarterly increases or decreases in our earnings, speculation in the investment community about our financial condition or results of operations and changes in revenue or earnings estimates, downgrades in our credit ratings, announcement of new products, technological developments, alliances, acquisitions or divestitures by us or one of our competitors or the loss of key management personnel. In addition, general macroeconomic and market conditions unrelated to our financial performance may also affect our stock price. The accounting method for convertible debt securities with net share settlement, like our Convertible Notes, may be subject to change. On January 26, 2007, we issued $700 million of convertible notes with a net share settlement feature. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, a convertible debt security providing for net share settlement of the conversion value and meeting specified requirements under EITF Issue No. 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own Stock (Net Share Convertibles), is accounted for interest expense purposes similarly to non-convertible debt, with the stated coupon constituting interest expense and any shares issuable upon conversion of the security being accounted for under the treasury stock method. The effect of the treasury stock method is that the shares potentially issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of our earnings per share except to the 20 Table of Contents extent that the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount, in which case the number of shares of our common stock necessary to settle the conversion are treated as having been issued for earnings per share purposes. At the July 25, 2007 FASB meeting, the Board agreed to issue for comment a proposed FASB Staff Position (FSP) addressing convertible instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion. The proposed FSP, as expected to be drafted, would require, among other things, the issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuers non-convertible debt borrowing rate and would be effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2007. We cannot predict the outcome of the EITF deliberations or any other changes in GAAP that may be made affecting accounting for convertible debt securities. Any change in the accounting method for convertible debt securities could have an adverse impact on our past or future financial results. In addition, these impacts could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including managements assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experiences difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price.
