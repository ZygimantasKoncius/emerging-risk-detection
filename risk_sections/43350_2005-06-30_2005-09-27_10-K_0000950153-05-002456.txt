Risk Factors in Part II, as well as other factors that we are currently unable to identify or quantify, but may exist in the future. In addition, the foregoing factors may affect generally our business, results of operations and financial position. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statement was made. We do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. ITEM 1. BUSINESS. Overview Energy West, Incorporated (the Company) is a regulated public utility, with certain non-utility operations conducted through its subsidiaries. We were originally incorporated in Montana in 1909. We have four reporting segments:  Natural Gas Operations Distributes natural gas to approximately 33,000 customers through regulated utilities operating in and around Great Falls and West Yellowstone Montana, and Cody Wyoming. The approximate population of the service territories is 100,000.  Propane Operations Distributes propane to approximately 7,900 customers through utilities operating underground vapor systems in and around Payson, Pine and Strawberry, Arizona and retail distribution of bulk propane to approximately 2,200 customers in the same Arizona communities. The approximate population of the service territories is 40,000.  Energy West Resources, Inc. (EWR) Markets approximately 3 billion cubic feet of natural gas to commercial and industrial customers in Montana and Wyoming and manage midstream supply and production assets for transportation customers and utilities. EWR also has an ownership interest in production and gathering assets.  Pipeline Operations (formerly Energy West Development, Inc. (EWD)) Owns the Shoshone interstate and the Glacier gathering pipeline assets located in Montana and Wyoming. Certain natural gas producing wells owned by EWD are being managed and reported in EWR. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for financial information for each of our segments. 3 Table of Contents Natural Gas Operations Our natural gas operations consist of two divisions. The Montana Division serves customers with operations in Great Falls, West Yellowstone, and Cascade, Montana. It also manages certain storage and vaporization facilities in Cascade, Montana for Energy West Propane. The Wyoming Division serves customers in and around Cody, Meeteetse and Ralston, Wyoming. Generally, residential customers use natural gas for space heating and water heating; commercial customers use natural gas for space heating, water heating and cooking; and industrial customers use natural gas as a fuel in industrial processing and space heating. Our revenues from natural gas operations are generated under tariffs regulated by the state utility commissions of Montana and Wyoming. Natural Gas  Montana Division The Montana division provides natural gas service to customers in and around Great Falls and West Yellowstone, Montana and manages an underground vapor system in Cascade, Montana. The divisions service area has a population of approximately 79,000 in the Great Falls area, 1,200 in the West Yellowstone area and approximately 900 in the Cascade area. The Montana division has right of way privileges for its distribution systems either through franchise agreements or general franchise agreements within its respective service territories. The Great Falls distribution component of the Montana division also provides natural gas transportation service to certain customers who purchase natural gas from other suppliers. The Montana division received orders during the 2005 fiscal year from the Montana Public Service Commission or MPSC, respecting base rates in both Great Falls and West Yellowstone, Montana. These orders were granted pursuant to general rate applications filed by the division in fiscal year 2004. The Great Falls order was effective on an interim basis on November 1, 2004 and made final in August of 2005. That rate order effectively granted full recovery of the increased property tax liability resulting from the settlement reached with the Montana Department of Revenue in fiscal year 2004. It also provided recovery of other operating expenses as requested by the Company. The West Yellowstone rate order granted relief related to its share of the Montana Department of Revenue settlement as well as other operating expenses. The following table shows the Montana divisions revenues by customer class for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 and the two preceding fiscal years: Gas Revenue Years Ended June 30, 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Residential $ 18,116 $ 16,427 $ 13,643 Commercial 11,437 9,918 8,383 Transportation 1,939 1,856 1,789 Total $ 31,492 $ 28,201 $ 23,815 Note: Revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 due to higher gas costs as well as reflecting a full year of rate increases related to recovering property taxes. Fiscal year 2004 is higher as compared to fiscal year 2003 from increases in gas pricing and rate relief from approved rate cases in Montana for part of fiscal 2004. 4 Table of Contents The following table shows the volumes of natural gas, expressed in millions of cubic feet, or MMcf, sold or transported by the Montana division for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 and the two preceding fiscal years: Gas Volumes Years Ended June 30, 2005 2004 2003 (MMcf) Residential 2,136 2,206 2,267 Commercial 1,267 1,317 1,359 Transportation 1,493 1,443 1,462 Total Gas Sales 4,896 4,966 5,088 The Montana division has 199 transportation customers. No customer of the Montana division accounted for more than 1% of our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005. The operations of the Montana division are subject to regulation by the MPSC. The MPSC regulates rates, adequacy of service, issuance of securities, compliance with U.S. Department of Transportation safety regulations and other matters. The MPSC allows customers to choose a natural gas supplier other than the Montana division, but the Montana division provides gas transportation to customers who purchase from other suppliers. The Montana division uses the NorthWestern Energy, or NWE, pipeline transmission system to transport supplies of natural gas for its core load and to provide transportation, distribution and balancing services to customers who have chosen to obtain natural gas from other suppliers. In 2000, we entered into a ten-year transportation agreement with NWE that fixes the cost of pipeline and storage capacity for the Montana division. The Montana division files monthly gas trackers that adjust the gas cost recovery component of its rates to current market pricing. This process is designed to keep deferred gas cost balances at minimum expected levels. Natural Gas  Wyoming Division The Wyoming division provides natural gas service to customers in and around Cody, Meeteetse and Ralston, Wyoming. This service area has a population of approximately 12,000. The Wyoming division has a certificate of public convenience and necessity granted by the Wyoming Public Service Commission, or WPSC, for transportation and distribution covering the west side of the Big Horn Basin, which extends approximately 70 miles north and south and 40 miles east and west from Cody. As of June 30, 2005, the Wyoming division provided service to 5,951 customers, including one industrial customer. The Wyoming division also offers transportation through its system. This service is designed to permit producers and other purchasers of gas to transport their gas to markets outside of the Wyoming divisions distribution and transmission system. 5 Table of Contents The following table shows the Wyoming divisions revenues by customer class for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 and the two preceding fiscal years: Gas Revenue Years Ended June 30, 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Residential $ 4,805 $ 4,149 $ 3,119 Commercial 4,434 3,606 2,591 Industrial 4,059 3,107 2,102 Total $ 13,298 $ 10,862 $ 7,812 Note: Higher revenues were realized in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 due to higher gas costs and a general rate increase approved by Wyoming Public Service Commission at the end of fiscal year 2003 as well as higher commodity pricing in fiscal year 2004. The following table shows volumes of natural gas, expressed in MMcf, sold by the Wyoming division for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 and the two preceding fiscal years: Gas Volumes Years Ended June 30, 2005 2004 2003 (MMcf) Residential 519 515 541 Commercial 582 540 531 Industrial 643 568 525 Total Gas Sales 1,744 1,623 1,597 The Wyoming division has an industrial customer whose gas sales rates are subject to an industrial tariff, which provides for lower incremental prices as higher volumes are used. In fiscal year 2005 this customer accounted for approximately 30% of the revenues of the Natural Gas  Wyoming division and approximately 9% of the consolidated revenues of the Natural Gas segment. This customers business is cyclical and dependent on the level of national housing starts. Gross revenues from this customer in fiscal year 2005 increased approximately 31% over revenues in fiscal year 2004 EWR is the Wyoming divisions supplier of natural gas, pursuant to a three year agreement entered into in May of 2003. The Wyoming division transports gas for third parties pursuant to a tariff filed with and approved by the WPSC. The terms of the transportation tariff (currently between $.08 and $.31 per Mcf) are approved by the WPSC. The Wyoming divisions revenues are generated under regulated tariffs designed to recover a base cost of gas and administrative and operating expenses and provide a sufficient rate of return to cover interest and profit. The Wyoming divisions tariffs include a purchased gas adjustment clause, which allows the Wyoming division to adjust rates periodically to recover changes in gas costs from base gas costs. Propane Operations We are engaged in the regulated sale of propane under the business name Energy West Arizona or EWA. EWA distributes propane in the Payson, Pine, and Strawberry, Arizona area located about 75 miles northeast of Phoenix in the Arizona Rim Country. The service area of EWA includes approximately 575 square miles and has a population of approximately 40,000. The operations of EWA are subject to regulation by the Arizona Corporation Commission or ACC, which regulates rates, adequacy of service, and other matters. EWAs properties include approximately 170 miles of underground 6 Table of Contents distribution pipeline and an office building leased from a third party. EWA purchases propane from our unregulated subsidiary, Energy West Propane, Inc. or EWP, under terms reviewed periodically by the ACC. EWA has approximately 7,900 regulated customers. The principal competition comes from bulk propane retailers who sell to customers who use propane from storage tanks located at their homes or businesses rather than using propane from EWAs underground distribution system. EWP is engaged in the bulk sale of propane through its two divisions  Energy West Propane-Arizona, which serves the Payson, Pine, and Strawberry, Arizona area, and Rocky Mountain Fuels Wholesale or RMF which has wholesale operations primarily in Arizona. EWP had 2,188 unregulated customers as of June 30, 2005. EWPs wholesale division, RMF, supplies propane for our underground propane-vapor systems serving the cities of Cascade, Montana and Payson, Arizona and surrounding areas. The majority of RMFs Wyoming and Montana assets, including the Superior, Montana terminal were sold on August 21, 2003. EWP faces competition from other propane distributors and suppliers of alternative fuels that compete with propane. Competition is based primarily on price and there is a high degree of competition with other propane distributors in each of our service areas. The following tables show propane revenues and volumes by customer class for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 and the two preceding fiscal years: Propane Revenue Years Ended June 30, 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Residential $ 6,509 $ 5,456 $ 5,155 Commercial 2,310 2,280 7,631 Total $ 8,819 $ 7,736 $ 12,786 Propane Volume Years Ended June 30, 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands of gallons) Residential 4,115 3,735 3,786 Commercial 1,513 2,095 11,940 Total 5,628 5,830 15,726 Note: Decreases in revenues and volumes are a result of the sale of certain assets of RMF in August 2003. EWR Our wholly-owned subsidiary, EWR, conducts certain marketing activities involving the sale of natural gas in Montana and Wyoming. It also marketed electricity in Montana for approximately a three year period beginning in 1999. During this period, EWR did not own any electric generating or transmission assets, but served as a broker, purchasing electricity from third parties and reselling it to end use customers throughout Montana. During fiscal year 2003, EWRs participation in the electric market as a broker of electricity was evaluated and the decision was made to exit the electricity marketing business. Therefore, contracts for such electricity were not renewed as they expired. During the fiscal years 2005 and 2004, we had only one remaining electric contract with a margin of $34,000 and $72,000 in each of those two years, respectively. The electricity operations are reported within continuing operations because we use the same employees with the same overhead as our natural gas marketing operation. EWR has only two 7 Table of Contents remaining contracts, one with a commercial customer and the other with the supplier to obtain the electricity for the commercial customer. The terms of these contracts extend through fiscal 2006. In order to provide a stable source of natural gas for a portion of its requirements, EWR and EWD purchased ownership in two natural gas production properties and three gathering systems located in north central Montana. The purchases were made in May 2002 and March 2003. This production gives EWR a natural hedge when market prices of natural gas are above the cost of production. The gas production from the properties provided approximately 5% of EWRs volume requirements for fiscal 2005. Pipeline Operations We added Pipeline Operations as a new segment as of July 1, 2002. The results of this segment reflect operation of the Glacier natural gas gathering system placed in service in fiscal year 2001 and the Shoshone transmission pipeline placed in service on July 3, 2003. Both pipelines have sections located in Wyoming and Montana. The revenues and expenses associated with the pipelines are included in the Pipeline Operations segment. Competition The traditional competition we face in our distribution and sales of natural gas is from suppliers of alternative fuels, including electricity, oil, propane and coal. Traditionally, the principal considerations affecting a customers selection of utility gas service over competing energy sources include service, price, equipment costs, reliability and ease of delivery. In addition, the type of equipment already installed in businesses and residences significantly affects the customers choice of energy. However, with respect to the majority of our service territory, previously installed equipment is not an issue. Households in recent years have generally preferred the installation of gas heat. For example, we estimate that approximately 97% of the homes and businesses in the Great Falls, Montana service area use natural gas as their primary source for space heating fuel; approximately 93% use gas for water heating; and approximately 99% of the new homes built on or near our Great Falls, Montana service mains in recent years have selected natural gas as their energy source. We face more intense competition in West Yellowstone and Cascade, Montana and the Payson/ Strawberry area of Arizona due to the cost of competing fuels than we face in the Great Falls area of Montana and our service territory in Wyoming. The Wyoming division estimates that approximately 95% of the homes and businesses in its service area use natural gas for space heating fuel; approximately 90% use gas for water heating; and approximately 99% of the new homes built on or near the Wyoming divisions service mains in recent years have selected gas as their energy source. The principal competition we face in the distribution and sale of propane is from electricity suppliers and other propane distributors. Competition is based primarily on price and customer service and there is a high degree of competition from other propane distributors in all of the service areas. The Propane  Arizona division estimates that approximately 67% of the homes and businesses adjacent to the divisions distribution pipeline use the divisions propane for space heating or water heating. Studies show that approximately 90% of new subdivisions within the divisions distribution system are using propane as their primary fuel source. Finally, EWRs principal competition is from other gas marketing firms doing business in Montana. Governmental Regulation Our utility operations are subject to regulation by the MPSC, the WPSC, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or FERC and the ACC. Such regulation plays a significant role in determining our return on equity. The commissions approve rates intended to permit a reasonable rate of return on investment. Our tariffs allow gas cost to be recovered in full (barring a finding of imprudence) in regular (as often as monthly) rate adjustments. This mechanism has substantially reduced any delay between the incurrence 8 Table of Contents and recovery of gas costs. In addition, final orders have been received in the Montana Division for the West Yellowstone and Great Falls service territories as a result of general rate filings made by us in fiscal year 2004. The rate increases approved approximately $200,000 in increased revenues for West Yellowstone and approximately $800,000 in increased revenues for Great Falls. Both rate orders were effective for service rendered on and after November 1, 2004. Seasonality Our business and that of our subsidiaries in all segments is temperature-sensitive. In any given period, sales volumes reflect the impact of weather, in addition to other factors. Colder temperatures generally result in increased sales. We anticipate that this sensitivity to seasonal and other weather conditions will continue to be reflected in our sales volumes in future periods. Environmental Matters We own property on which we operated a manufactured gas plant from 1909 to 1928. The site is currently used as an office facility for field personnel and storage location for certain equipment and materials. The coal gasification process utilized in the plant resulted in the production of certain by-products that have been classified by the Federal government and the State of Montana as hazardous to the environment. We have completed our remediation of soil contaminants at the plant site and in April of 2002 received a closure letter from Montana Department of Environmental Quality, or MDEQ, approving the completion of such remediation program. We and our consultants continue to work with the MDEQ relating to the remediation plan for water contaminants. The MDEQ has established regulations that allow water contaminants at a site to exceed standards if it is technically impracticable to achieve those standards. Although the MDEQ has not established guidance respecting the attainment of a technical waiver, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, has developed such guidance. The EPA guidance lists factors that render mediations technically impracticable. We have filed a request for a waiver from complying with certain standards with the MDEQ. At June 30, 2005, we had incurred cumulative costs of approximately $1,925,000 in connection with our evaluation and remediation of the site. On May 30, 1995, we received an order from the MPSC allowing for recovery of the costs associated with the evaluation and remediation of the site through a surcharge on customer bills. As of June 30, 2005, we had recovered approximately $1,512,000 through such surcharges. As of June 30, 2005, the cost remaining to be recovered is $413,000. On April 15, 2003, the MPSC issued an Order to Show Cause Regarding the Environmental Surcharge. The MPSC determined that the initial order allowing the collection of the surcharge was intended by the MPSC to cover only a two year collection period, after which it would contemplate additional filings by the Company, if necessary. We responded to the Show Cause Order and the MPSC subsequently ordered the termination of the Environmental Surcharge on August 20, 2003. We filed a request with the commission to continue the collection of the surcharge until all expenses have been recovered. This request was approved by the MPSC and the surcharge was reinstated in September 2004. We are required, under the Commissions most recent order, to file with the MPSC every two years for approval to continue the recovery of the surcharge. Employees We had a total of 111 employees as of June 30, 2005. One of these employees is employed by EWR, 22 by our Propane Operations, 77 by our Natural Gas Operations and 11 at the corporate office. Our Natural Gas Operations include 17 employees represented by two labor unions. Contracts with each of these unions expire on June 30, 2006. 9 Table of Contents
