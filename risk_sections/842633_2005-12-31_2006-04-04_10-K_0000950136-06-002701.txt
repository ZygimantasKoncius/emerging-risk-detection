Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions, including global economic events, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, terrorism, other international conflicts, natural disasters or other disruptions of unexpected economic/business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impact our business operations, financial results and liquidity. We have a history of net losses. We incurred net losses of $45.9 million, $2.2 million and $30.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These losses principally resulted from the high interest expense associated with our highly leveraged capital structure. Non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization of intangible assets and asset impairments also contributed to our net losses. Net losses may continue in the future. Our businesses depend upon general economic conditions and we serve some customers in highly cyclical industries; as such we are subject to the loss of sales and margin due to an economic downturn or recession. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets that we serve in both the U.S. and global economies. Some of the industries that we serve are highly cyclical, such as the automotive, construction, industrial equipment, energy, aerospace and electrical equipment industries. We may experience a reduction in sales and margins as a result of a downturn in economic conditions. Lower demand may also negatively affect our capacity utilization, which may further reduce our operating margins. Many of the markets we serve are highly competitive, which could limit the volume of products that we sell and reduce our operating margins. Many of our products are sold in competitive markets. We believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality, price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, reliability and timeliness of delivery, customer service and effectiveness of distribution. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support of our distribution networks. We may have insufficient resources in the future to continue to make such investments and, even if we make such investments, we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position. As is the case with any U.S. manufacturer, we also face the risk of lower cost foreign manufacturers located in China and elsewhere in Southeast Asia competing in the markets for our products and we may be driven as a consequence of this competition to increase our investment overseas. Competitive pressure may limit the volume of products that we sell and reduce our operating margins. Increases in our raw material or energy costs or the loss of critical suppliers could adversely affect our profitability and other financial results. We are sensitive to price movements in our raw materials supply base. Our largest material purchases are for steel, polyethylene and other resins and energy. When we experience cost increases 19 for raw materials, energy and other commodities, it may be difficult for us to completely offset the impact with price increases on a timely basis due to outstanding commitments to our customers, competitive considerations and our customers' resistance to accepting such price increases. A failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with certain raw materials or component parts on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, would have a material adverse effect on us. To the extent there are energy supply disruptions or material fluctuations in energy costs, our margins could be materially adversely impacted. Historically, we have grown primarily through acquisitions. If we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates, successfully integrate acquired operations or realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions, we may be adversely affected. One of our principal growth strategies is to pursue strategic acquisition opportunities. A substantial portion of our historical growth has derived from acquisitions. Since our separation from Metaldyne in June 2002, we have completed seven acquisitions. Each of these acquisitions required integration expense and actions that negatively impacted our results of operations and that could not have been fully anticipated beforehand. In addition, attractive acquisition candidates may not be identified and acquired in the future, financing for acquisitions may be unavailable on satisfactory terms and we may be unable to accomplish our strategic objectives in effecting a particular acquisition. We may encounter various risks in acquiring other companies, including the possible inability to integrate an acquired business into our operations, diversion of management's attention and unanticipated problems or liabilities, some or all of which could materially and adversely affect our business strategy and financial condition and results of operations. We may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategies. Our ability to realize our growth opportunities, apart from acquisitions and related cost savings, may be limited. We have identified many growth opportunities, involving new product development, cross-selling, product bundling, cost reduction measures and similar organic growth opportunities. However, our businesses operate in relatively stable industries and it may be difficult to successfully pursue these strategies and realize material benefits therefrom. Even if we are successful, other risks attendant to our businesses and the economy generally may substantially or entirely eliminate the benefits. While we have been successful with some of these strategies in the past, our growth has principally come through acquisitions. Our products are typically highly engineered or customer-driven and we are subject to risks associated with changing technology and manufacturing techniques which could place us at a competitive disadvantage. We believe that our customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of product quality, price competitiveness, technical expertise and development capability, new product innovation, reliability and timeliness of delivery, product design capability, manufacturing expertise, operational flexibility, customer service and overall management. Our success depends on our ability to continue to meet our customers' changing specifications with respect to these criteria. We anticipate that we must remain committed to product research and development, advanced manufacturing techniques and service to remain competitive. We may be unable to address technological advances, implement new and more cost-effective manufacturing techniques, or introduce new or improved products, whether in existing or new markets, so as to remain competitive within our businesses or to grow our businesses as desired. Furthermore, we may be unable to adequately protect our own technological developments to produce a sustainable competitive advantage. We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property. While we believe that our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property have significant value, it is uncertain that this intellectual property or any intellectual property acquired or developed by us in the future, will provide a meaningful competitive advantage. Our patents or pending applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by competitors or rights granted 20 thereunder may not provide meaningful proprietary protection. Moreover, competitors may infringe on our patents or successfully avoid them through design innovation. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive, and we may not be able to, or have the resources to, prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the United States. An adverse outcome in any intellectual property litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to license technology or other intellectual property rights from others, require us to comply with injunctions to cease marketing or using certain products or brands, or require us to redesign, reengineer, or re-brand certain products or packaging. Further, we may incur costs in terms of legal fees and expenses, whether or not the claim is valid, to respond to intellectual property infringement claims. These or other liabilities or claims may increase or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future results of operations. We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability, recall and warranty claims that may be brought against us. We are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our businesses, including claims for damages arising out of use of our products, claims relating to intellectual property matters and claims involving employment matters and commercial disputes. In addition, one of our Industrial Specialties segment subsidiaries is a party to lawsuits related to asbestos contained in gaskets formerly manufactured by it or its predecessors. Some of this litigation includes claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages. Resolution of these litigation matters may divert our management's attention and we may incur significant litigation costs in defending these matters and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our businesses. Our business may be materially and adversely affected by compliance obligations and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations. We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water and establish standards for the generation, treatment, use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We may be legally or contractually responsible or alleged to be responsible for the investigation and remediation of contamination at various sites, and for personal injury or property damages, if any, associated with such contamination. We have been named as potentially responsible parties under the federal Superfund law or similar state laws in several sites requiring cleanup related to disposal of wastes we generated. We have entered into consent decrees relating to two sites in California along with the many other co-defendants in these matters. We have incurred substantial expenses for all these sites over a number of years, a portion of which has been covered by insurance. See "Business—Legal Proceedings" for a discussion of these matters. In addition to the foregoing, our businesses have incurred and likely will continue to incur expenses to investigate and clean up existing and former company-owned or leased property. Additional sites may be identified at which we are a potentially responsible party under the federal Superfund law or similar state laws. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the U.S. and abroad in connection with our operations. There can be no assurance that we have been or will be at all times in substantial compliance with environmental health and safety laws. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil, criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. We have substantial debt and interest payment requirements that may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our obligations. We continue to have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders' equity. As of December 31, 2005, we have approximately $727.7 million of outstanding debt and approximately $349.3 million of shareholders' equity. Approximately 40% of our debt bears interest at variable rates and we may experience material increases in our interest expense as a result of increases in interest rate levels generally. Our debt service payment obligations in 2005 were approximately $73.4 million 21 and based on amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2005 a 1% increase in the per annum interest rate for our variable rate debt would increase our interest expense by approximately $2.9 million annually. Our degree of leverage and level of interest expense may have important consequences, including: • our leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage as compared with our less leveraged competitors and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in any of our businesses; • our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited; • our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, business development efforts, general corporate or other purposes may be impaired; • a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes, including our operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities or obligations to pay rent in respect of our operating leases; and • our operations are restricted by our debt instruments, which contain material financial and operating covenants, and those restrictions may limit, among other things, our ability to borrow money in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, rent expense or other purposes. Our ability to service our debt and other obligations will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow, and future financings may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds, to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategies. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources." Restrictions in our debt instruments and accounts receivable facility limit our ability to take certain actions and breaches thereof could impair our liquidity. Our credit facility and the indenture governlng our senior subordinated notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to: • pay dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock; • incur additional indebtedness and grant liens; • make acquisitions and joint venture investments; • sell assets; and • make capital expenditures. Our credit facility also requires us to comply with financial covenants relating to, among other things, interest coverage and leverage. Our accounts receivable facility contains covenants similar to those in our credit facility and includes additional requirements regarding our receivables. We may not be able to satisfy these covenants in the future or be able to pursue our strategies within the constraints of these covenants. Substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries (other than our special purpose receivables subsidiary) are pledged as collateral pursuant to the terms of our credit facility. A breach of a covenant contained in our debt instruments could result in an event of default under one or more of our debt instruments, our accounts receivable facility and our lease financing arrangements. Such breaches would permit the lenders under our credit facility to declare all amounts borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, and the commitments of such lenders to make further extensions of credit could be terminated. In addition, such breach may cause a termination of our accounts receivable facility. Each of these circumstances could materially and adversely impair our liquidity. 22 We have significant operating lease obligations and our failure to meet those obligations could adversely affect our financial condition. We lease many of our manufacturing facilities and certain capital equipment. Our annualized rental expense under these operating leases approximates $17.2 million. A failure to pay our rental obligations would constitute a default allowing the applicable landlord to pursue any remedy available to it under applicable law, which would include taking possession of our property and, in the case of real property, evicting us. These leases are categorized as operating leases and are not considered indebtedness for purposes of our debt instruments. We have significant goodwill and intangible assets, and future impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a material negative impact on our financial results. At December 31, 2005 our goodwill and intangible assets were approximately $900.0 million, and represented approximately 63.0% of our total assets. Our net loss of $45.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 included a charge of $41.6 million, net of income tax benefit of $28.7 million, for impairment of property and equipment and intangible assets related to our industrial fasteners business which is held for sale and is reported as discontinued operations. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We may be subject to further unionization and work stoppages at our facilities or our customers may be subjected to work stoppages, which could seriously impact the profitability of our business. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 18% of our work force was unionized under several different unions and bargaining agreements. If our unionized workers or those of our customers or suppliers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown in the future, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations. In addition, if a greater percentage of our work force becomes unionized, our labor costs and risks associated with strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns may increase. Many of our direct or indirect customers have unionized work forces. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by these customers or their suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures of assembly plants where our products are included. In addition, organizations responsible for shipping our customers' products may be impacted by occasional strikes or other activity. Any interruption in the delivery of our customers' products could reduce demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on us. Our healthcare costs for active employees and future retirees may exceed our projections and may negatively affect our financial results. We maintain a range of healthcare benefits for our active employees and a limited number of retired employees pursuant to labor contracts and otherwise. Healthcare benefits for active employees and certain retirees are provided through comprehensive hospital, surgical and major medical benefit provisions or through health maintenance organizations, all of which are subject to various cost-sharing features. Some of these benefits are provided for in fixed amounts negotiated in labor contracts with the respective unions. If our costs under our benefit programs for active employees and retirees exceed our projections, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, foreign competitors and many domestic competitors provide fewer benefits to their employees and retirees, and this difference in cost could adversely impact our competitive position. A growing portion of our sales may be derived from international sources, which exposes us to certain risks which may adversely affect our financial results and impact our ability to service debt. Approximately 17.2% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 were derived from sales by our subsidiaries located outside of the United States. We may significantly expand our international operations through internal growth and acquisitions. Sales outside of the United States, 23 particularly sales to emerging markets, and foreign manufacturing are subject to various other risks which are not present within U.S. markets, including governmental embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as antidumping duties, changes in U.S. and foreign governmental regulations, tariffs and other trade barriers, the potential for nationalization of enterprises, foreign exchange risk and other political, economic and social instability. In addition, there are tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash flow from non-U.S. subsidiaries that could affect our financial results and reduce our ability to service debt. Item 1B.
