The Corporation, through its subsidiary bank, offers a full range of commercial banking services. These banking services include business and personal checking accounts, savings and individual retirement accounts, time deposit instruments, electronically accessed banking products, residential and commercial real estate financing, commercial lending, consumer financing, debit cards, safe deposit box services, money transfer services, automated teller machines, access to insurance products and corporate and personal trust and investment management services. The principal markets for the Corporations commercial banking services are communities within Michigan in which the Corporations subsidiary banks branches are located and the areas immediately surrounding those communities. As of December 31, 2008, the Corporation operated through one subsidiary bank, Chemical Bank, headquartered in Midland, Michigan, serving 90 communities through 129 banking offices and 3 loan production offices located in 31 counties across Michigans lower peninsula. In addition to its banking offices, the Corporation operated 141 automated teller machines, both on- and off-bank premises. Chemical Bank operates through an internal organizational structure of four regional banking units. The Corporations regional banking units are collections of branch banking offices organized by geographical regions within the state. The principal source of revenue for the Corporation is interest and fees on loans, which accounted for 72% of total revenue in 2008, 71% of total revenue in 2007 and 72% of total revenue in 2006. Interest on investment securities is also a significant source of revenue, accounting for 10% of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006. Business volumes are influenced by overall economic factors including market interest rates, business and consumer spending, consumer confidence and competitive conditions in the marketplace. RECENT MARKET DEVELOPMENTS In response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions, on October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) was signed into law. The EESA created the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), under which the United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury) was given the authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. In October 2008, the Treasury announced that it would purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts. Under the program, known as the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), the Treasury made $250 billion of the $700 billion authorized under TARP available to U.S. financial institutions through the purchase of preferred stock. In conjunction with the purchase of preferred stock, the Treasury received, from participating financial institutions, warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to 15% of the preferred stock investment. Participating financial institutions were required to agree to restrictions on future dividends and share repurchases during the period in which the preferred stock remained outstanding. On December 18, 2008, the Corporation announced that it had elected not to accept the $84 million capital investment approved by the Treasury as part of the CPP. The board of directors and management of the Corporation determined that the potential dilution to the Corporations shareholders and various restrictions outweighed any potential benefits from the Corporations participation in the CPP. In November 2008, the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) adopted a final rule relating to the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). The TLGP was announced by the FDIC on October 14, 2008, as an initiative to counter the system-wide crisis in the nations financial sector. Under the TLGP, the FDIC will (i) guarantee, through the earlier of maturity or June 30, 2012, certain newly-issued senior unsecured debt issued by participating institutions on or after October 14, 2008, and through June 30, 2009 and (ii) provide full FDIC deposit insurance coverage for noninterest bearing transaction deposit accounts, Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) accounts paying less than 0.5% interest per annum and Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts held at participating FDIC-insured institutions through December 31, 2009. Coverage under the TLGP was available for the first 30 days without charge. The fee assessment for coverage of senior unsecured debt ranges from 50 basis points to 100 basis points per annum, depending on the initial maturity of the debt. The fee assessment for deposit insurance coverage is an annualized 10 basis points assessed quarterly on amounts in covered accounts exceeding $250,000. On December 4, 2008, the Corporation elected to participate in both guarantee programs. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation held $16.2 million of Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (FHLB) stock and $116.1 million of senior bonds that were issued by all of the Federal Home Loan Banks. There are 12 regional banks that make up the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLBanks). There was no impairment of the FHLB stock or FHLBanks senior bonds held by the 3 Table of Contents Corporation at December 31, 2008. FHLBanks are government-sponsored enterprises created by Congress to ensure access to low-cost funding for their member financial institutions. During January 2009, a number of the regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System publicly announced that they could incur significant other-than-temporary losses on their private-label mortgage-backed securities due to the dramatic decline in interest rates during 2008. In response, Moodys issued a special comment in January 2009 indicating their rating of FHLBanks was likely to remain unchanged due to the expectation that these banks have a very high degree of government support. However, if the financial condition or results of operations of the FHLB or FHLBanks materially adversely changes, the Corporation could be subject to recording impairment of the recorded cost of $16.2 million of the FHLB stock and $116.1 million of FHLBanks senior bonds. The financial condition of the FHLB could also potentially impact the future liquidity available to the Corporation through its borrowings with the FHLB. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS The following discussion and analysis is intended to cover the significant factors affecting the Corporations consolidated statements of financial position and income included in this report. It is designed to provide shareholders with a more comprehensive review of the consolidated operating results and financial position of the Corporation than could be obtained from an examination of the financial statements alone. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Corporations consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and follow general practices within the industry in which the Corporation operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and complex judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value or when a decline in the value of an asset not carried at fair value on the financial statements warrants an impairment write-down or a valuation reserve to be established. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by third-party sources, when available. When third-party information is not available, valuation adjustments are estimated by management primarily through the use of internal discounted cash flow analysis. The most significant accounting policies followed by the Corporation are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other notes to the consolidated financial statements and in Managements Discussion and Analysis, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, estimates and assumptions underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses, pension plan accounting, income and other taxes, and the evaluation of goodwill impairment to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such, could be most subject to revision as new or additional information becomes available or circumstances change, including overall changes in the economic climate and/or market interest rates. Management reviews its critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the board of directors at least annually. In 2008, it was determined that the accounting estimates related to the capitalization and valuation of real estate mortgage loan servicing rights (MSRs) did not have a material impact on the Corporations financial condition or operating performance and, therefore, has been removed from this disclosure. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding MSRs. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses (allowance) is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve sufficient to absorb inherent loan losses of the loan portfolio. The loan portfolio represents the largest asset type on the consolidated statements of financial position. The determination of the amount of the allowance is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans and on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The principal assumption used in deriving the allowance is the estimate of a loss percentage for each type of loan. In determining the allowance and the related provision for loan losses, the Corporation considers four principal elements: (i) specific impairment reserve allocations based upon probable losses identified during the review of impaired commercial, real estate 4 Table of Contents commercial and real estate construction-commercial loan portfolios (valuation allowances), (ii) allocations established for adversely-rated commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans and nonaccrual real estate residential and nonaccrual consumer loans, (iii) allocations on all other loans based principally on the most recent three years of historical loan loss experience and loan loss trends, and (iv) an unallocated allowance based on the imprecision in the overall allowance methodology. It is extremely difficult to precisely measure the amount of losses that are inherent in the Corporations loan portfolio. The Corporation uses a defined methodology to quantify the necessary allowance and related provision for loan losses, but there can be no assurance that the methodology will successfully identify and estimate all of the losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio. As a result, the Corporation could record future provisions for loan losses that may be significantly different than the levels that have been recorded in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance. In addition, a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance is included under the subheading Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Pension Plan Accounting The Corporation has a defined benefit pension plan for certain salaried employees. Effective June 30, 2006, benefits under the defined benefit pension plan were frozen for approximately two-thirds of the Corporations salaried employees as of that date. Pension benefits continued unchanged for the remaining salaried employees. The Corporations pension benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts and measurements. Benefits under the plan are based on years of vested service, age and compensation. Assumptions are made concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of required benefit payments, funding requirements and pension expense. The key actuarial assumptions used in the pension plan are the discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported for net periodic pension expense, as well as the respective benefit obligation amounts. The Corporation evaluates these critical assumptions annually. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Corporation calculated the discount rate for the pension plan using the results from a bond matching technique, which matched cash flows of the pension plan against both a bond portfolio derived from the Standard & Poors bond database of AA or better bonds and the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve, to determine the discount rate. As of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the discount rate was established at 6.50%, 6.50% and 6.00%, respectively, to reflect market interest rate conditions. The assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets represents an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting primarily of equities and fixed income investments. When determining the expected long-term return on pension plan assets, the Corporation considers long-term rates of return on the asset classes in which the Corporation expects the pension funds to be invested. The expected long-term rate of return is based on both historical and forecasted returns of the overall stock and bond markets and the actual portfolio. The following rates of return by asset class were considered in setting the assumptions for long-term return on pension plan assets: December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 Equity securities 7%  8% 8%  9% 8%  9% Debt securities 4%  6% 4%  6% 4%  6% Other 2%  5% 3%  5% 3%  5% The assumed long-term return on pension plan assets is developed through an analysis of forecasted rates of return by asset class and forecasted asset allocations. It is used to compute the subsequent years expected return on assets, using the market-related value of pension plan assets. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on pension plan assets during the year is either an asset gain or loss, which is deferred and amortized over future periods when determining net periodic pension expense. The Corporations projection of the long-term return on pension plan assets was 7% in 2008, 2007 and 2006. Other assumptions made in the pension plan involve employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and the rate of compensation increase. The key actuarial assumptions that will be used to calculate 2009 pension expense for the defined benefit pension plan are a discount rate of 6.50%, a long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7% and a rate of compensation increase of 4.25%. Pension expense in 2009 is expected to be approximately $0.6 million, the same as 2008. In 2009, an increase in the discount rate of 50 basis points was estimated to reduce pension expense by less than $0.1 million and a decrease in the discount rate of 50 basis points was estimated to increase pension expense by $0.3 million. There are uncertainties associated with the underlying key actuarial assumptions, and the potential exists for significant, and possibly material, impacts on either or both the results of operations and cash flows (e.g., additional pension expense and/or additional 5 Table of Contents pension plan funding, whether expected or required) from changes in the key actuarial assumptions. If the Corporation were to determine that more conservative assumptions are necessary, pension expense would increase and have a negative impact on results of operations in the period in which the increase occurs. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158, Employers Accounting For Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158). The Corporation adopted SFAS 158 on December 31, 2006, as required. The purpose of SFAS 158 is to improve the overall financial statement presentation of pension and other postretirement plans, but did not impact the determination of the net periodic benefit cost or measurement of plan assets or obligations. SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize the over- or under-funded status of a plan as an asset or liability as measured by the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation and requires any unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses to be recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The defined benefit pension plan incurred net unrealized losses during 2008 of $17 million, which was the primary reason for a decline in the value of pension plan assets of $17.5 million, or 22%, during the year. The adverse impact of the decline in the value of pension plan assets during 2008 had an adverse impact on shareholders equity at December 31, 2008. The impact of SFAS 158 on the statements of financial position at December 31, 2008 and 2007 is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Income and Other Taxes The Corporation is subject to the income and other tax laws of the United States and the state of Michigan. These laws are complex and are subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities. In determining the provisions for income and other taxes, management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex laws, related regulations and case law. In the process of preparing the Corporations tax returns, management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws. These interpretations are subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on managements ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law. The Corporation and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The provision for federal income taxes is based on income and expenses, as reported in the consolidated financial statements, rather than amounts reported on the Corporations federal income tax return. When income and expenses are recognized in different periods for tax purposes than for book purposes, applicable deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. On a quarterly basis, management assesses the reasonableness of its effective federal tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reassessed on an annual basis, or sooner, if business events or circumstances warrant. Reserves for uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations or audits. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were no federal income tax reserves recorded based on the regular reassessment of required tax accruals for these uncertain tax positions. Goodwill At December 31, 2008, the Corporation had $69.9 million of goodwill recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position. Under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), amortization of goodwill ceased, and instead, goodwill is tested by management annually for impairment, or more frequently if triggering events occur and indicate potential impairment. In addition, the Corporations goodwill impairment assessment is reviewed annually, as of September 30, by an independent third-party appraisal firm utilizing the methodology and guidelines established in SFAS 142. This methodology involves assumptions regarding the valuation of the Corporations subsidiary bank that purchased the acquired entities and resulted in the recording of goodwill. The value of the Corporations subsidiary bank was measured utilizing the market and income approaches as prescribed in SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), with a 75% weighting given to the income approach. SFAS 157 identifies the cost approach as another acceptable method; however, the cost approach was not deemed an effective method to value a financial institution. The cost approach estimates value by adjusting the reported values of assets and liabilities to their market values. It is the Corporations opinion that financial institutions cannot be liquidated in an efficient manner. Estimating the fair market value of loans is a very difficult process and subject to a wide margin of error unless done on a loan by loan basis. Voluntary liquidations of financial institutions are not typical. More commonly, if a financial institution is liquidated, it is due to being taken over by the FDIC. The value of the Corporations subsidiary bank was based on the going concern method and not as a liquidation. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (cash flows or earnings) to a single, discounted amount. The income approach includes present value techniques; option-pricing models, such as the Black-Scholes-Merton formula and lattice models, and the 6 Table of Contents multi-period excess-earnings method. In the valuation of the Corporations subsidiary bank, the income approach utilized the discounted cash flow method based upon a forecast of growth and earnings. Cash flows are measured by using projected earnings, projected dividends and dividend paying capacity over a five-year period. In addition to estimating periodic cash flows, an estimate of residual value is determined through the capitalization of earnings. The income approach assumed cost savings and earnings enhancements that a strategic acquiror would likely implement based upon typical market participant assumptions of market transactions. The discount rate is critical to the discounted cash flow analysis. The discount rate reflects the risk of uncertainty associated with the cash flows and a rate of return that investors would require from similar investments with similar risks. A discount rate of 13.5% was utilized in the income approach. The market approach uses observable prices and other relevant information that are generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The fair value measure is based on the value that those transactions indicate utilizing both financial and operating characteristics of the companies sold or merged. Two of the more significant financial ratios analyzed in completed transactions included price to latest twelve months earnings and price to tangible book value. The market approach utilized a price to latest twelve months earnings ratio of 25 times and a price to tangible book value of 170%. The fair value of the Corporations subsidiary bank was determined to be slightly above the income approach and in the low to middle of the market approach to value range. The weighted average of the fair values determined under the income and market approaches was a discount compared to the market capitalization of the Corporation at the valuation date. The Corporation is publicly traded and, therefore, The Nasdaq Stock Market® establishes the marketable minority value. This does not necessarily represent the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole. The results of the valuation analysis concluded that the fair value of the Corporations subsidiary bank was greater than its book value, including goodwill, and thus no goodwill impairment was evident at the valuation date of September 30, 2008. The Corporation determined that no triggering events occurred that indicated potential impairment of goodwill from the valuation date through December 31, 2008. The Corporation believes that the assumptions utilized were reasonable. However, the Corporation could incur impairment charges related to goodwill in the future due to changes in business prospects or other matters that could affect the valuation assumptions. MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS The Corporations primary method of expansion into new banking markets has been through acquisitions of other financial institutions and bank branches. During the three years ended December 31, 2008, the Corporation completed the following acquisition: In August 2006, the Corporation acquired two branch bank offices in Hastings and Wayland, Michigan from First Financial Bank, N.A., headquartered in Hamilton, Ohio, operating as Sand Ridge Bank. The Corporation acquired deposits of $47 million, loans of $64 million and other miscellaneous assets of $1.7 million. The Corporation recorded goodwill of $6.8 million and core deposit intangible assets of $2.7 million. The core deposit intangible assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis over ten years. The loans acquired were comprised of $6 million in commercial loans, $13 million in real estate commercial loans, $38 million in real estate residential loans and $7 million in consumer loans. During December 2006, the Corporation sold $14 million of long-term fixed interest rate real estate residential loans that were acquired in this transaction and recognized gains totaling approximately $1 million. NET INCOME Net income in 2008 was $19.8 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, net income in 2007 was $39.0 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, and net income in 2006 was $46.8 million, or $1.88 per diluted share. Net income in 2008 represented a 49.1% decrease from 2007 net income, while 2007 net income represented a 16.7% decrease from 2006 net income. Net income per share in 2008 was 48.1% less than in 2007, while net income per share in 2007 was 14.9% less than in 2006. The decrease in net income in 2008 was primarily attributable to a significant increase in the provision for loan losses that was only partially offset by an increase in net interest income. The decrease in net income in 2007 was attributable to a decrease in net interest income and increases in both the provision for loan losses and operating expenses. The Corporations return on average assets was 0.52% in 2008, 1.03% in 2007 and 1.24% in 2006. The Corporations return on average shareholders equity was 3.9% in 2008, 7.7% in 2007 and 9.2% in 2006. ASSETS Average assets were $3.78 billion during 2008, a decrease of less than $1 million from average assets during 2007 of $3.79 billion. Average assets were $3.79 billion during 2007, an increase of $22.0 million, or 0.6%, from average assets during 2006 of $3.76 billion. The increase in average assets during 2007 was primarily attributable to an increase in short-term investments that resulted from slightly higher average deposits. 7 Table of Contents INVESTMENT SECURITIES The Corporations investment securities portfolio historically has been relatively short-term in nature.

Impairment is other-than-temporary if the assessment concludes that it is probable that the holder will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt instrument. SFAS 115 permits the use of reasonable management judgment of the probability that the holder will or will not be able to collect all amounts due. In addition, SFAS 115 also requires that the holder must have the intent and ability to hold the security to recovery for an impairment to be deemed temporary and not require a charge to earnings. In addition, FASB Staff Position (FSP) 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, clarified that an investor should recognize an impairment loss in the period that the impairment is deemed other-than-temporary. The accounting guidance does not provide for an automatic conclusion that a security does not have other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) because all of the scheduled payments to date have been received. Further analysis and judgment are required to assess whether a decline in fair value is temporary and that it is probable that the holder will collect all of the contractual or estimated cash flows from the investment security. Further, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5M, Other-than-Temporary Impairment of Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, states that the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost can indicate a decline is other-than-temporary. The longer and/or the more severe the decline in fair value, the more persuasive the evidence that is needed to overcome the premise that the holder will not collect all of the contractual or estimated cash flows from the investment security. Accordingly, in making an OTTI assessment, the holder is to consider all available information relevant to the collectibility of the investment security, including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, when developing the estimate of future cash flows. The accounting literature also recommends the holder consider industry analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit ratings and other market data that are relevant to the collectibility of the investment security. The Corporations investment securities portfolio had a carrying value of $547.5 million at December 31, 2008, with gross impairment of $10.8 million as of that date. The Corporation concluded that at December 31, 2008 the impairment was temporary. A further discussion of the impairment and the Corporations process that resulted in the conclusion that the impairment was temporary follows. At December 31, 2008, the Corporations investment securities portfolio included U.S. Treasury and government sponsored agency securities that had no impairment, state and political subdivisions securities with gross impairment of $1.17 million, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, combined, with gross impairment of $0.59 million, corporate bonds with gross impairment of $2.40 million and trust preferred securities with gross impairment of $6.67 million. The carrying values and fair values of investment securities are disclosed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. 9 Table of Contents The state and political subdivisions held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio totaling $85.5 million at December 31, 2008 was recorded at amortized cost. The majority of these investment securities are from issuers primarily located in the state of Michigan and are general obligations of the issuer, meaning that the Corporation has the first claim on taxes collected for the repayment of the investment securities. Of the total $85.5 million, investment securities totaling $34.1 million had gross impairment of $1.17 million at December 31, 2008. The majority of the investment securities with impairment mature beyond 2016 and, due to the steepness of the interest yield curve at December 31, 2008, the Corporation determined that the impairment of $1.17 million at December 31, 2008 was attributable to the change in market interest rates and that the impairment was temporary in nature. The Corporation has the intent and ability to hold these impaired investment securities to maturity. The mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, combined in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio, had an amortized cost of $204.7 million, with gross impairment of $0.59 million at December 31, 2008. Virtually all of the impaired investment securities in these two categories are backed by an explicit guarantee of the U.S. government. The Corporation assessed the impairment on these investment securities at December 31, 2008 and determined the impairment was attributable to the general decline in market interest rates and the impairment on these investment securities at that date was temporary in nature. The Corporation has the intent and ability to hold these impaired investment securities to maturity. At December 31, 2008, the Corporations corporate bond portfolio had an amortized cost of $47.5 million, with gross impairment of $2.40 million. Fair values of 90% of the corporate bonds were below amortized cost at December 31, 2008. All of the corporate bonds held at December 31, 2008 were of an investment grade, except one single issue investment security, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., for which the Corporation recognized an OTTI loss of $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2008. The Corporations remaining amortized cost of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bond was less than $0.1 million at December 31, 2008. The investment grade ratings obtained for the balance of the corporate bond portfolio indicated that the obligors capacities to meet their financial commitments was strong. The majority of the impairment existing at December 31, 2008 was attributable to two corporate bonds from one issuer with a combined amortized cost/par value of $2.7 million that had impairment of $1.6 million, or 68%, of the total impairment on corporate bonds at that date. Both corporate bonds are senior unsecured obligations of American General Finance Corporation (AGFC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of American General Finance Inc. (AGFI), which is wholly-owned indirectly by American International Group (AIG). The amortized cost/par value amounts of the bonds were $0.2 million and $2.5 million with maturity dates of September 1, 2010 and December 15, 2011, respectively. The Corporation performed an assessment of the probability that it would collect all of the contractual amounts due under the two AGFC corporate bonds at December 31, 2008. Ratings from Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch were Baa1, BBB and BBB, respectively, at December 31, 2008. AGFC was downgraded by each of these rating services twice during 2008 (the most recent downgrade occurred on November 10, 2008), although all of these rating services indicated, through the assignment of their ratings, that the issuer appeared to have a strong ability to pay its financial obligations in the intermediate term and supports an investment grade rating. The public filing of AGFCs Form 10-Q with the SEC for the period ended September 30, 2008 indicated AGFC had suffered a financial loss of $496 million in the third quarter of 2008 and $558 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2008; however, AGFCs total equity at September 30, 2008 was $2.8 billion, or 9.6% of total assets. AGFCs own assessment of its financial condition at September 30, 2008 indicated that, after consideration of many factors, although primarily due to its ability to obtain funding from its parent company and its ability to severely reduce originations of finance receivables, AGFC believed it would have adequate liquidity to finance and operate its businesses and repay its obligations for at least the next twelve months. However, it is possible that the actual outcome of one or more of AGFCs significant judgments or estimates could prove to be materially incorrect and AGFC may not have sufficient cash to meet its obligations in the future. A $0.1 million AGFC bond owned by the Corporation that matured on October 15, 2008 was paid in full on that date. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation believed it was probable, as defined by SFAS 115, that it would receive all contractual cash flows of its corporate bond portfolio and determined that the impairment on the corporate bond portfolio at that date was temporary in nature. The Corporation has the intent and ability to hold these impaired investment securities to maturity. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation owned $10.5 million of trust preferred securities that had gross impairment of $6.67 million. Of the $10.5 million balance, $10 million represented a 100% interest in a trust preferred security (TRUP) of a small non-public bank holding company in Michigan (issuer) that was purchased in the second quarter of 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation determined the fair value of the TRUP was $3.65 million. The fair value measurement was developed based upon market pricing observations of much larger banking institutions in an illiquid market adjusted by risk measurements. The fair value of the TRUP was based on a calculation of discounted cash flows, based upon both observable inputs and appropriate risk adjustments that market participants would make for performance, liquidity and issuer specifics. See the additional discussion of the development of the fair value of the TRUP in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. 10 Table of Contents Management reviewed non-audited financial information of the issuer of the TRUP at December 31, 2008, including nonperforming asset information and Tier I capital/risk-weighted assets ratios. Based on this review, the Corporation concluded that the significant decline in fair value of the TRUP, compared to its amortized cost, was not attributable to adverse conditions specifically related to the issuer. At December 31, 2008, it was the Corporations opinion that the issuer appeared well positioned to continue to realize positive net income in 2009. The issuer had consistent earnings in 2007 and 2008 and, at December 31, 2008, had equity capital of $50 million, a liquidity position of $160 million in investment securities held as available-for-sale and additional borrowing capacity of approximately $100 million through the FHLB. Based on the Corporations analysis at December 31, 2008, it was the Corporations opinion that the issuer appeared to be a financially sound institution with ample liquidity to meet all of its financial obligations in 2009. This TRUP is not independently rated and, therefore, there was no published downgrade of the investment during 2008. Industry bank ratings, obtained from the issuer, indicated the issuer was defined as sound. Common stock cash dividends were paid throughout 2008 by the issuer and the issuers management anticipates cash dividends to be paid in 2009 and beyond. All scheduled interest payments on the TRUP were made on a timely basis in 2008. The principal of $10 million of the TRUP matures in 2038, with interest payments due quarterly. Based on the information provided by the issuer, as of December 31, 2008, it was the Corporations opinion that there had been no adverse changes in the issuers financial performance since the TRUP was issued and purchased by the Corporation and no indication that any adverse trends were developing that would suggest that the TRUP would be unable to make all future principal and interest payments. Further, based on the information provided, the issuer appeared to be a financially viable financial institution with both the credit quality and liquidity necessary to meet all financial obligations in 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation was not aware of any regulatory issues, memorandums of understanding or cease and desist orders that had been issued to the issuer or its subsidiaries. In reviewing all available information regarding the issuer reflecting past performance and its financial and liquidity position, it was the Corporations opinion that the future cash flows of the issuer supported the carrying value of the TRUP at its original cost of $10 million at December 31, 2008. There can be no assurance that other-than-temporary impairment losses will not be recognized on TRUPs or any other investment security in the future. While the fair value of the TRUP was $6.35 million below the Corporations carrying value (original cost) at December 31, 2008 and the TRUP was impaired, it was the Corporations assessment that the overall financial condition of the issuer did not indicate permanent or other-than-temporary impairment of the TRUP and that the unrealized loss was temporary at December 31, 2008. The Corporation has the intent and ability to hold this impaired investment security to maturity. DEPOSITS Total deposits at December 31, 2008 were $2.98 billion, an increase of $103.2 million, or 3.6%, from total deposits at December 31, 2007 of $2.88 billion. Total deposits increased $22.5 million, or 0.8%, during 2007. The increase in total deposits in 2008 was primarily attributable to a fourth quarter increase in business and non-retail money market deposit accounts with no defined maturities. The Corporations average deposit balances and average rates paid on deposits for the past three years are included in Table 3. Average total deposits in 2008 were $2.92 billion, an increase of $1.4 million over average deposits in 2007. Average total deposits in 2007 were $2.92 billion, an increase of $61.1 million, or 2.1%, over average deposits in 2006. There was no significant growth or change in the mix of average deposits during 2008 or 2007, nor did the Corporation have any brokered deposits as of December 31, 2008 or 2007. It is the Corporations strategy to develop customer relationships that will drive core deposit growth and stability. The Corporation has historically gathered deposits from the local markets of its subsidiary bank, although strong competition impeded the Corporations ability to internally generate deposits during the three years ended December 31, 2008. As was publicized nationwide during 2008, many of the Corporations competitor banks in its local markets faced liquidity issues and concerns that resulted in their necessity to increase deposits by offering above market interest rates. This activity created a difficult environment for the Corporation to increase deposits without adversely impacting the weighted average cost of deposits. The Corporation had ample liquidity in 2008, and therefore, did not seek new deposits at above market interest rates. The growth of the Corporations deposits is also impacted by competition from other investment products, such as mutual funds and various annuity products. These investment products are sold by a wide spectrum of organizations, such as brokerage and insurance companies, as well as by financial institutions. The Corporation also competes with credit unions in most of its markets. These institutions are challenging competitors, as credit unions are exempt from federal income taxes, allowing them to potentially offer higher deposit rates and lower loan rates to customers. In response to the competition for other investment products, the Corporations subsidiary bank, through its CFC Investment Center program, offers a wide array of mutual funds, annuity products and marketable securities through an alliance with an independent, registered broker/dealer. During 2008 and 2007, customers purchased $106 million and $82 million, respectively, of annuity products, mutual fund and other investments through the CFC Investment Center program. 11 Table of Contents CASH DIVIDENDS The Corporations annual cash dividends paid per share over the past five years, adjusted for all stock dividends, were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Annual Cash Dividend (per share) $ 1.18 $ 1.14 $ 1.10 $ 1.06 $ 1.01 During 2008, cash dividends paid per share were $1.18, up 3.5% over cash dividends paid per share in 2007 of $1.14. The Corporation has paid regular cash dividends every quarter since it began operating as a bank holding company in 1973. The compound annual growth rate of the Corporations cash dividends paid per share over the past five- and ten-year periods ended December 31, 2008 was 4.4% and 6.5%, respectively. The earnings of the Corporations subsidiary bank, Chemical Bank, have been the principal source of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders. Over the long-term, cash dividends to shareholders are dependent upon earnings, as well as capital requirements, regulatory restraints and other factors affecting Chemical Bank. Due to the strength of the Corporations capital position, the parent company has the ability to continue to pay cash dividends to shareholders in excess of the earnings of Chemical Bank. The length of time the parent company can sustain cash dividends to shareholders in excess of the current earnings of Chemical Bank is dependent on the magnitude of any earnings shortfall and the capital levels of both Chemical Bank and the Corporation. NET INTEREST INCOME Interest income is the total amount earned on funds invested in loans, investment and other securities, federal funds sold and other interest-bearing deposits. Interest expense is the amount of interest paid on interest-bearing checking and savings accounts, time deposits, short-term borrowings and FHLB advances. Net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis, is the difference between interest income and interest expense adjusted for the tax benefit received on tax-exempt commercial loans and investment securities. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income (FTE) by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, or free funds (principally demand deposits and shareholders equity), also support earning assets, the net interest margin exceeds the net interest spread. The presentation of net interest income on a FTE basis is not in accordance with GAAP but is customary in the banking industry. This non-GAAP measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt loans and investment securities. The adjustments to determine tax equivalent net interest income were $2.37 million, $2.25 million and $2.11 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These adjustments were computed using a 35% federal income tax rate. Net interest income is the most important source of the Corporations earnings and thus is critical in evaluating the results of operations. Changes in the Corporations net interest income are influenced by a variety of factors, including changes in the level of interest-earning assets, changes in the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the level and direction of interest rates, the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates (the steepness of the yield curve) and the general strength of the economies in the Corporations markets. Risk management plays an important role in the Corporations level of net interest income. The ineffective management of both credit risk and interest rate risk can adversely impact the Corporations net interest income. Management monitors the Corporations consolidated statement of financial position to reduce the potential adverse impact on net interest income caused by significant changes in interest rates. The Corporations policies in this regard are further discussed under the subheading Market Risk. Table 3 presents for 2008, 2007 and 2006 average daily balances of the Corporations major categories of assets and liabilities, interest income and expense on a FTE basis, average interest rates earned and paid on the assets and liabilities, net interest income (FTE), net interest spread and net interest margin. Net interest income (FTE) in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $147.6 million, $132.3 million and $134.3 million, respectively. Net interest income (FTE) in 2008 was $15.3 million, or 11.6%, higher than 2007 net interest income (FTE) of $132.3 million, although net interest income (FTE) in 2007 was $2.0 million, or 1.5%, lower than 2006 net interest income (FTE) of $134.3 million. The increase in net interest income (FTE) in 2008 was primarily attributable to the positive impact of lower short-term interest rates reducing interest expense more than interest income and to a lesser extent attributable to the growth in loans. The decrease in short-term market interest rates reduced the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities significantly more than the average yield on loans and investment securities throughout 2008, as the loan portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed interest rate loans. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately 79% and 81%, respectively, of the Corporations loans were at fixed interest rates. 12 Table of Contents TABLE 3.

In 2008, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the Federal Funds rate seven times throughout the year for a total reduction of 425 basis points, which resulted in an equal decline each time in the prime rate, except for the last decline which lowered the effective Federal Funds rate 25 basis points more than the prime rate. The Federal Funds rate was effectively near 0% on December 31, 2008, compared to 4.25% on December 31, 2007. The prime rate was 3.25% on December 31, 2008, compared to 7.25% on December 31, 2007. The ten-year U.S. Treasury note, which is generally used to price both 15- and 30-year residential mortgage loans, was 2.25% at the end of 2008, compared to 4.04% at the end of 2007. Net interest margin was 4.16% in 2008, compared to 3.73% in 2007. The increase in net interest margin during 2008, compared to 2007, was primarily attributable to the decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities significantly exceeding the decrease in the average yield on interest-earning assets. During 2008, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 119 basis points to 2.33%, while the average yield on interest-earning assets decreased 49 basis points to 5.93%. The significant decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was attributable to the overall decrease in short-term market interest rates in 2008. The yield on the Corporations loan portfolio decreased only 54 basis points in 2008, compared to 2007, due to the loan portfolio being comprised predominately of fixed interest rate loans or loans with interest rates fixed for at least five years. The increase in the net interest margin was also positively impacted by an increase in average loans of $67.3 million, or 2.4%, during 2008. The net interest margin was slightly adversely impacted in 2008 due to an increase in nonaccrual loans of $20.9 million, or 37.5%, during the year to $76.5 million at December 31, 2008. Table 4 allocates the dollar change in net interest income (FTE) between the portion attributable to changes in the average volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, including changes in the mix of assets and liabilities, and changes in average interest rates earned and paid. 13 Table of Contents TABLE 4.

The $15.3 million increase in net interest income (FTE) in 2008, as compared to 2007, is analyzed in detail in Table 4. The increase in net interest income (FTE) during 2008 was mostly attributable to the reduction in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities significantly exceeding the reduction in the average yield on interest-earning assets. The favorable effect of an increase in average loans of $67.3 million represents the majority of the increase in net interest income (FTE) attributable to average volume. The positive impact attributable to the increase in loans was partially offset by the adverse impact of modest changes in the mix of customer deposit accounts from lower-cost transaction and savings accounts to higher-cost money market savings accounts. The Corporations balance sheet was liability sensitive throughout 2008, with a significantly higher percentage of interest-bearing liabilities repricing than interest-earning assets. The Corporations competitive position within many of its market areas limits its ability to materially increase deposits without adversely impacting the weighted average cost of core deposits. In 2007, the FOMC lowered the Federal Funds rate three times during the last four months of the year, a total of 100 basis points, which resulted in an equal decline each time in the prime rate. The Federal Funds rate was 4.25% on December 31, 2007, compared to 5.25% on December 31, 2006. The prime rate was 7.25% on December 31, 2007, compared to 8.25% on December 31, 2006. While short-term interest rates were generally stable through the first half of 2007, long-term interest rates declined to produce an inverted interest yield curve in the two-to-five year segment of the curve through most of the first three quarters of the year. The ten-year U.S. Treasury note, which is generally used to price both 15- and 30-year residential mortgage loans, was 4.04% at the end of 2007, compared to 4.71% at the end of 2006. Net interest margin was 3.73% in 2007, compared to 3.82% in 2006. The decrease in net interest margin during 2007, compared to 2006, was primarily attributable to the increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets not keeping pace with the increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, resulting from the lagging impact of short-term market interest rates increasing in 2006. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 19 basis points to 6.42% in 2007. In comparison, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 36 basis points to 3.52% in 2007. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was attributable to a combination of factors, including the lagging impact of the increase in market interest rates during 2006 on certificates of deposit, the migration of customer funds from lower yielding deposit products into higher yielding time deposits and a slight change in the mix of deposits, with a slight decline in lower-cost consumer deposits being offset by increases in higher-cost business and municipal customer deposits. The yield on the Corporations loan portfolio changed only moderately due to the loan portfolio being comprised predominately of fixed interest rate loans or loans with interest rates fixed for at least five years. In addition, the competition for loan volume was strong during 2007 in the Corporations local markets, resulting in heightened pricing competition for new loan originations and lower than expected yields on new and refinanced loans. 14 Table of Contents LOANS The Corporations subsidiary bank is a full-service commercial bank and, therefore, the acceptance and management of credit risk is an integral part of the Corporations business. At December 31, 2008, the Corporations loan portfolio was $2.98 billion and consisted of loans to commercial borrowers (commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial) totaling $1.46 billion, or 49% of total loans, loans to consumer borrowers for the purpose of acquiring residential real estate (real estate construction-residential and real estate residential) totaling $869 million, or 29% of total loans, and loans to consumer borrowers secured by various types of collateral totaling $649 million, or 22% of total loans, at that date. Loans at fixed interest rates comprised 79% of the Corporations loan portfolio at December 31, 2008, compared to 81% at December 31, 2007. The Corporation maintains loan policies and credit underwriting standards as part of the process to manage credit risk. Underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. These standards include providing loans generally only within the Corporations market areas. The Corporations lending markets generally consist of small communities across the middle to southern and western sections of the lower peninsula of Michigan. The Corporations lending market areas do not include the southeastern portion of Michigan. The average size of commercial loan transactions is generally relatively small, which decreases the risk of loss within the commercial loan portfolio due to the lack of loan concentration. The Corporations commercial loan portfolio, defined as commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans, is well diversified across business lines and has no concentration in any one industry. The total commercial loan portfolio of $1.46 billion at December 31, 2008 included 63 loan relationships of $2.5 million and greater. These 63 borrowing relationships totaled $320 million and represented 22% of the total commercial loan portfolio at December 31, 2008. Further, at December 31, 2008, only four of these borrowing relationships were $10 million or higher, totaling $53.3 million, or 3.6%, of the commercial loan portfolio as of that date. The remaining commercial loan portfolio totaling $1.14 billion at December 31, 2008 consisted of approximately 5,900 relationships. The Corporation has no foreign loans or any loans to finance highly leveraged transactions. The Corporations lending philosophy is implemented through strong administrative and reporting controls at the subsidiary bank level, with additional oversight at the corporate level. The Corporation maintains a centralized independent loan review function, which monitors asset quality of the loan portfolio. The Corporations subsidiary bank has extended loans to its directors, executive officers and their affiliates. The loans were made in the ordinary course of business upon normal terms, including collateralization and interest rates prevailing at the time and did not involve more than the normal risk of repayment by the borrower or present other unfavorable features. Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements includes more information on loans to the Corporations directors, executive officers and their affiliates. The Corporation experiences competition for commercial loans primarily from larger regional banks located both within and outside of the Corporations market areas and from other community banks located within the Corporations lending markets. The Corporations competition for real estate residential loans primarily includes community banks, larger regional banks, savings associations, credit unions and mortgage companies. The Corporation experiences competition for consumer loans mostly from captive automobile finance companies, larger regional banks, community banks and local credit unions. The Corporations loan portfolio is generally diversified along industry lines, and therefore, the Corporation believes that its loan portfolio is reasonably sheltered from a material adverse economic impact in any one industry. Table 5 includes the composition of the Corporations loan portfolio, by major loan category, as of December 31, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004. TABLE 5. SUMMARY OF LOANS December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Distribution of Loans: Commercial $ 587,554 $ 515,319 $ 545,591 $ 517,852 $ 468,970 Real estate commercial 786,404 760,399 726,554 704,684 697,779 Real estate construction 119,001 134,828 145,933 158,376 120,900 Real estate residential 839,555 838,545 835,263 785,160 758,789 Consumer 649,163 550,343 554,319 540,623 537,102 Total loans $ 2,981,677 $ 2,799,434 $ 2,807,660 $ 2,706,695 $ 2,583,540 Total loans at December 31, 2008 were $2.98 billion, an increase of $182 million, or 6.5%, from total loans at December 31, 2007, compared to a slight decrease in loans of $8 million, or 0.3%, during 2007 and a $101 million, or 3.7%, increase in total loans during 2006. 15 Table of Contents The Corporations lending markets are all within the state of Michigan where the economy has been in a recession for a number of years. The recession in Michigan during most of 2008 has been characterized as severe and was exacerbated by the economic impact of a struggling automotive industry. However, the Corporations lending opportunities were strong throughout 2008 and resulted in the largest amount of loan growth measured in both dollars and percentages during the four years ended December 31, 2008. A significant portion of the loan growth in 2008 was attributable to the Corporations competitor banks intentionally reducing their lending efforts due to liquidity concerns. Additionally, during the second half of 2008, as the captive automotive finance companies largely exited the leasing business and significantly changed their underwriting standards, the Corporation experienced a significant increase in new auto loan origination opportunities. A summary of the changes in the loan portfolio by category follows. Commercial loans totaled $587.5 million at December 31, 2008, an increase of $72.2 million, or 14.0%, from total commercial loans at December 31, 2007 of $515.3 million. The growth in commercial loans during 2008 was attributable to a combination of an increase in loan balances of existing customers and loans to new customers. These increases arose throughout the Corporations lending markets and across a range of different industries. Commercial loans decreased $30.3 million, or 5.5%, during 2007 from total commercial loans at December 31, 2006 of $545.6 million. Commercial loans represented 19.7%, 18.4% and 19.4% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Real estate loans include real estate commercial loans, real estate construction loans and real estate residential loans. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, real estate loans totaled $1.74 billion, $1.73 billion and $1.71 billion, respectively. Real estate loans increased $11.2 million, or 0.6%, in 2008 and $26.0 million, or 1.5%, in 2007. Real estate loans as a percentage of total loans at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were 58.5%, 62.0% and 60.9%, respectively. Real estate commercial loans increased $26.0 million, or 3.4%, during 2008 to $786.4 million at December 31, 2008. Real estate commercial loans increased $33.8 million, or 4.7%, during 2007 to $760.4 million at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, real estate commercial loans as a percentage of total loans were 26.4%, 27.2% and 25.9%, respectively. Commercial lending and real estate commercial lending are generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than one- to four-family residential lending. Real estate commercial loans are loans secured by real estate occupied by the borrower for ongoing operations and non-owner occupied real estate leased to one or more tenants. At December 31, 2008, approximately 74% of the outstanding balance of the Corporations real estate commercial loans were secured by owner-occupied properties. Real estate commercial lending also includes loans to residential and commercial developers for the purchase of vacant land that is intended to be developed and land development loans. Land development loans are loans made to residential and commercial developers for infrastructure improvements to create finished marketable lots for residential or commercial construction. Vacant land loans are also made to borrowers for investment purposes. Commercial and real estate commercial lending typically involves larger loan balances concentrated in a single borrower. In addition, the payment experience on loans secured by income-producing properties, vacant land and land development loans are typically dependent on the success of the operation of the related project and are typically affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market and in the economy. The Corporation generally attempts to mitigate the risks associated with commercial lending by, among other things, lending primarily in its market areas, lending across industry lines, not developing a concentration in any one line of business and using prudent loan-to-value ratios in the underwriting process. Real estate construction loans are originated for both business and residential properties, including development. These loans often convert to a real estate commercial or real estate residential loan at the completion of the construction period, however, most development loans are originated with the intention that the loans will be paid through the sale of finished properties by the developers within twelve months of the completion date. The severe recession in Michigan has resulted in the inability of most developers to sell their finished developed lots and units within their original expected time frames. Further, few of the Corporations development borrowers sold developed lots or units during 2008 due to the poor economic environment. Real estate construction loans made to consumers are for the construction of single family residences and are secured by these properties. Real estate construction loans to consumers at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 were $29.3 million and $42.0 million, respectively. Total real estate construction loans were $119.0 million at December 31, 2008, a decrease of $15.9 million, or 11.7%, from December 31, 2007. The decrease in real estate construction loans was partially attributable to the lack of residential housing development lending during 2008, as it has been well publicized nationwide that this industry over expanded during the last few years. Business expansion and development continued at a historically low rate during 2008 across all of the Corporations market areas due to the recessionary economic environment within the state of Michigan. Real estate construction loans were $134.8 million at December 31, 2007, a decrease of $11.1 million, or 7.6%, from December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, real estate construction loans as a percentage of total loans were 4.0%, 4.8% and 5.2%, respectively. Real estate construction lending involves a higher degree of risk than one- to four-family residential lending because of the uncertainties of construction, including the possibility of costs exceeding the initial estimates and the need to obtain a tenant or purchaser of the property if it will not be owner-occupied. The Corporation generally attempts to mitigate the risks associated with construction lending by, among other things, lending primarily in its market areas, using prudent underwriting guidelines and closely 16 Table of Contents monitoring the construction process. The Corporations risk in this area increased during 2008 as the sale of units in residential real estate development projects slowed significantly, as customer demand significantly decreased and the inventory of unsold housing units increased across the state of Michigan. Table 6 presents the maturity distribution of commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction loans. These loans totaled $1.49 billion at December 31, 2008, compared to $1.41 billion at December 31, 2007 and represented 50% of total loans at December 31, 2008 and 2007. The percentage of these loans maturing within one year was 36% at December 31, 2008, compared to 38% at December 31, 2007. The percentage of these loans maturing beyond five years remained low at 9% at both December 31, 2008 and 2007. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction loans with maturities beyond one year totaled $962 million and $875 million, respectively, and were comprised of 91% and 90%, respectively, of loans at fixed interest rates.

The increase in real estate residential loans was low, compared to the growth in other loan categories, as the housing market across the state of Michigan was extremely weak throughout 2008. Real estate residential loans increased $3.3 million, or 0.4%, during 2007 to $838.5 million at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, real estate residential loans as a percentage of total loans were 28.1%, 30.0% and 29.8%, respectively. The Corporations real estate residential loans primarily consist of one- to four-family residential loans with original fixed interest rates of fifteen years or less. The loan-to-value ratio at the time of origination is generally 80% or less. Loans with more than an 80% loan-to-value ratio generally have private mortgage insurance. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation had $52.2 million in real estate residential loans, or 6.2%, of the real estate residential loan portfolio that had private mortgage insurance. The Corporations general practice is to sell real estate residential loan originations with interest rates fixed for time periods greater than ten years in the secondary market. The Corporation originated $344 million of real estate residential loans during 2008 and sold $145 million of these originations in the secondary market, compared to the origination of $311 million in real estate residential loans during 2007 and the sale of $136 million of these originations in the secondary market. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation was servicing $604 million of real estate residential loans that had been originated by the Corporation in its market areas and subsequently sold in the secondary mortgage market. At December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the Corporation was servicing real estate residential loans for others in the amounts of $576 million and $558 million, respectively. Consumer loans totaled $649.2 million at December 31, 2008, an increase of $98.9 million, or 18.0%, from total consumer loans at December 31, 2007 of $550.3 million. Consumer loans decreased $4.0 million, or 0.7%, during 2007. Consumer loans represented 21.8%, 19.6% and 19.7% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 17 Table of Contents Consumer loans generally have shorter terms than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk than one- to four-family residential lending because of the type and nature of the collateral. The Corporation originates consumer loans utilizing a computer-based credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process. Consumer loans are generally relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, which minimizes the risk per loan transaction. Collateral values, particularly those of automobiles, recreational vehicles and boats, are negatively impacted by many factors, such as new car promotions, vehicle condition and even more significantly, overall economic conditions. Consumer loans also include home equity loans, whereby consumers utilize equity in their personal residence, generally through a second mortgage, as collateral to secure the loan. Credit risk in these types of loans has historically been low as property values of residential real estate have historically increased year over year. Credit risk on home equity loans increased during 2008 as property values declined an average of 15% throughout the state of Michigan, thus increasing the risk of insufficient collateral, and in some cases, no collateral available on these loans when the consumer is no longer able to make payments. At December 31, 2008, approximately 40% of consumer loans were secured by the borrowers personal residences, 25% by automobiles, 15% by recreational vehicles, 10% by marine vehicles and the remaining 10% was mostly unsecured. Consumer lending collections are dependent on the borrowers continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal situations. Overall, credit risk on these loans increases as the unemployment rate increases. The unemployment rate in the state of Michigan was over 10% at December 31, 2008, which was significantly higher than the national average of 7% at that date. NONPERFORMING ASSETS Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, which are defined as loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued and loans that are past due as to principal or interest by ninety days or more and are still accruing interest, and assets obtained through foreclosures and repossessions. The Corporation transfers a loan that is ninety days or more past due to nonaccrual status, unless it believes the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Accordingly, the Corporation has determined that the collection of accrued and unpaid interest on any loan that is ninety days or more past due and still accruing interest is probable. Nonperforming assets were $113.3 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $74.5 million at December 31, 2007, and $35.8 million at December 31, 2006 and represented 2.9%, 2.0% and 0.9%, respectively, of total assets. It is managements opinion that the increase in nonperforming assets is largely attributable to the severe recessionary economic climate within Michigan, which has resulted in cash flow difficulties being encountered by many business and consumer loan customers. The unemployment rate in Michigan was over 10% at December 31, 2008, compared to 7% nationwide. The increase in the Corporations nonperforming assets was not concentrated in any one industry or any one geographical area within Michigan. In addition, the sizes of the commercial loan transactions are generally relatively small, which mitigates somewhat the risk of loss within the commercial loan portfolio due to the lack of loan concentration. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation had 63 commercial loan relationships of $2.5 million and greater that totaled $320 million and comprised 22% of commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans at that date, with four loan relationships exceeding $10 million and totaling $53 million. The remaining commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans totaling $1.14 billion at December 31, 2008 consisted of approximately 5,900 loan relationships. While it has been well publicized nationwide throughout 2008 that appraisal values of residential real estate have generally declined, the Corporation has also experienced declines in commercial real estate appraisals due to the weakness in the economy in Michigan. It is managements assessment that as of December 31, 2008, for both real estate commercial and residential loans, the discounted loan-to-value ratios within the Corporations loan portfolio are generally still within an acceptable underwriting range. Based on the declines in both commercial and residential real estate values, management continues to discount appraised values to compute estimated fair market values of real estate secured loans. The Corporation considers a loan as impaired when management determines it is probable that all of the principal and interest due under the contractual terms of the loan will not be collected. Consistent with this definition, all nonaccrual loans (with the exception of nonaccrual real estate residential and nonaccrual consumer loans) are impaired. The Corporation measures impairment on commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans. In most instances, the impairment is measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. Impairment may also be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate. Impaired loans were $59.0 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $45.9 million at December 31, 2007 and $19.8 million at December 31, 2006. After analyzing the various components of the customer relationships and evaluating the underlying collateral of impaired loans, it was determined that impaired loans totaling $30.3 million at December 31, 2008 required a valuation allowance compared to $22.2 million of impaired loans at December 31, 2007 and $3.8 million of impaired loans at December 31, 2006. The valuation allowance on impaired loans was $9.2 million at December 31, 2008 compared to $4.6 million at December 31, 2007 and $0.9 million at December 31, 2006. 18 Table of Contents The following table provides a five-year history of nonperforming assets and the composition of nonperforming loans by major loan category: TABLE 7.

The increase in nonperforming loans occurred across all loan categories. The increase in the level of nonperforming loans in 2008 was largely attributable to the recessionary economic conditions in the state of Michigan and in the Corporations local markets that have been existent in the state of Michigan since 2006, only to have worsened in 2008 with no economic indications of improving in 2009. Commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction nonperforming loans totaled $71.4 million at December 31, 2008, or 76%, of total nonperforming loans at that date. The majority of the Corporations net loan charge-offs during 2008 also occurred within these three loan categories, with 80% of net loan charge-offs in 2008 attributable to these three loan categories. The following schedule provides the composition of nonperforming loans, by major loan category, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. December 31, 2008 2007 % % Amount of Total Amount of Total (Dollars in thousands) Commercial $ 17,976 19 % $ 12,919 20 % Real estate commercial 37,339 40 23,842 38 Real estate construction 16,069 17 12,979 20 Sub-total 71,384 76 49,740 78 Real estate residential 15,544 17 9,986 16 Consumer 6,400 7 3,634 6 Total nonperforming loans $ 93,328 100 % $ 63,360 100 % 19 Table of Contents Nonperforming real estate residential loans were $15.5 million at December 31, 2008, an increase of $5.5 million, or 56%, from total nonperforming real estate residential loans of $10.0 million at December 31, 2007. Nonperforming real estate residential loans represented 17% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2008, compared to 16% at December 31, 2007. The increase in nonperforming real estate residential loans was attributable to a rise in delinquencies, bankruptcies and foreclosures primarily reflective of an increase in the unemployment rate in the state of Michigan. Nonperforming consumer loans were $6.4 million at December 31, 2008, an increase of $2.8 million, or 76%, from total nonperforming consumer loans of $3.6 million at December 31, 2007. The increase in nonperforming consumer loans during 2008 was also primarily reflective of an increase in the unemployment rate in the state of Michigan. The following schedule presents additional data related to nonperforming commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction loans by dollar amount as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. December 31, 2008 2007 Number of Number of Borrowers Amount Borrowers Amount (Dollars in thousands) $5.0 million or more 1 $ 6,083 1 $ 6,060 $2.5 million - $4,999,999 3 10,259 2 5,728 $1.0 million - $2,499,999 12 18,868 10 15,986 $500,000 - $999,999 20 14,758 11 8,072 $250,000 - $499,999 31 10,125 19 6,232 Under $250,000 133 11,291 105 7,662 Total 200 $ 71,384 148 $ 49,740 Nonperforming commercial loans of $18.0 million at December 31, 2008 were up $5.1 million, or 39%, from nonperforming commercial loans at December 31, 2007 of $12.9 million. The nonperforming commercial loans at December 31, 2008 were not concentrated in any single industry and it is managements opinion that the increase in 2008 was primarily reflective of the recessionary economic conditions in Michigan. The Corporations real estate commercial loan portfolio is comprised of commercial real estate, land development and vacant land loans. Real estate commercial loans are secured by real estate occupied by the borrower for ongoing operations and by non-owner occupied real estate leased to one or more tenants. Land development loans are secured by land that is being developed in terms of infrastructure improvements to create finished marketable lots for commercial or residential construction. Vacant land loans are secured by undeveloped land that has been acquired for future development or investment purposes. Nonperforming real estate commercial loans totaled $37.3 million at December 31, 2008, up $13.5 million, or 57%, from $23.8 million at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, the Corporations nonperforming real estate commercial loans included a diverse mix of commercial lines of business and were also geographically disbursed throughout the Corporations market areas. The largest concentrations of the $37.3 million in nonperforming real estate commercial loans at December 31, 2008 were $3.5 million in loans secured by residential development real estate and loans totaling $5.7 million to one customer that were secured primarily by vacant land, which combined comprised 25% of nonperforming real estate commercial loans at that date. At December 31, 2008, $7.9 million of the nonperforming real estate commercial loans were in various stages of foreclosure with 27 borrowers. The Michigan economy remains weak, thus creating a difficult business environment for many lines of business across the state. Real estate construction loans are comprised of loans in the construction phase to both commercial and consumer customers. Real estate construction loans made to commercial customers are secured by commercial real estate and includes commercial and residential real estate development projects that the customer intends to sell and commercial real estate that the customer intends to convert to income producing property or become owner-occupied. These loans also include land development loans that are secured by land that is in the process of actively being developed in terms of infrastructure improvements to create finished marketable lots for future development. Real estate construction loans made to consumers are for the construction of single family residences and are secured by these properties. Nonperforming real estate construction loans at December 31, 2008 were $16.1 million, up $3.1 million, or 24%, from $13.0 million at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, $14.3 million of nonperforming real estate construction loans were secured by residential development real estate comprised of a combination of vacant land, improved lots and housing units. The economy in Michigan has significantly adversely impacted housing demand throughout the state and, accordingly, the Corporation 20 Table of Contents has experienced an increase in the number of its residential real estate development borrowers with cash flow difficulties associated with a significant decline in sales of residential real estate lots and units. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation had $68.9 million in residential development loans in various stages of completion, collateralized by a combination of vacant land, improved lots and housing units. These loans are included in the real estate commercial and real estate construction loan categories. At December 31, 2008, $17.7 million, or 26%, of residential development loans were nonperforming and are included in the nonperforming real estate commercial and nonperforming real estate construction loans discussed above. Other real estate and repossessed assets is a component of nonperforming assets that primarily includes real property acquired through foreclosure or by acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, and also personal and commercial property held for sale. Other real estate and repossessed assets totaled $19.9 million at December 31, 2008, up $8.8 million, or 79%, from $11.1 million at December 31, 2007. The increase during 2008 was the result of the migration of nonperforming loans secured by real estate into other real estate as the foreclosure processes were completed, including the expiration of the redemption periods. At December 31, 2008, other real estate and repossessed assets of $19.9 million was comprised of 29 commercial properties totaling $6.2 million, commercial development properties obtained from four developers totaling $1.6 million, 75 residential real estate properties totaling $7.0 million, 13 residential development projects totaling $4.7 million and other repossessions, including commercial equipment, automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles totaling $0.4 million. The commercial properties totaling $6.2 million at December 31, 2008 included six properties with carrying values greater than $0.25 million that totaled $4.3 million, with two of these properties having carrying values exceeding $1.0 million that totaled $2.3 million. The residential properties totaling $7.0 million at December 31, 2008 included four properties with carrying values greater than $0.25 million that totaled $3.0 million, with one of these properties having a carrying value of $1.6 million. The residential development projects totaling $4.7 million were primarily concentrated in five projects totaling $4.1 million, or 87% of the total. These residential development projects are unfinished in varying stages of completion. The largest residential development project is a high-rise mixed use condominium building with eleven unsold residential units and a carrying value of $1.8 million. Only one unit has been sold in this project and that unit was sold in 2005. The carrying value of $1.8 million on the high-rise mixed use condominium building at December 31, 2008 was net of $1.2 million in fair value write-downs, including $0.7 million that occurred during 2008. The historically large inventory of other real estate properties held for sale across the state of Michigan has resulted in an increase in the Corporations carrying time for other real estate. Consequently, the Corporation had $5.1 million in other real estate properties at December 31, 2008 that had been held in excess of one year as of that date. Due to severe economic conditions in the state of Michigan, management estimated that less than 50% of the other real estate held at December 31, 2008 will be sold during 2009. Additionally, due to the redemption period on foreclosures being relatively long in Michigan (nine months to one year) and the Corporation having a significant number of nonperforming loans that were in the process of foreclosure at December 31, 2008, management anticipates that the level of other real estate will continue to rise during 2009 and will likely remain at elevated levels for some period of time. Other real estate properties are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell. At December 31, 2008, all of the other real estate properties, except four properties totaling $0.6 million, had been written down to fair value through a combination of a loan charge-off at the transfer of the loan to other real estate and/or as an operating expense write-down due to further market value decline of the property after the initial transfer date. Accordingly, at December 31, 2008, the carrying value of other real estate of $19.5 million was reflective of $10.9 million in write-downs, which represents a 36% average write-down from the contractual loan balance remaining at the time the property was transferred to other real estate. There were 68 other real estate properties sold during 2008. Net proceeds from these sales totaled $8 million and on an average basis represented 72% of the remaining contractual loan balance at the time the Corporation received title to the properties. 21 Table of Contents PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES TABLE 8.

The provision for loan losses reflects managements evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. A summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses for the last five years is included in Table 8. The allowance for loan losses represents managements assessment of probable losses in the Corporations loan portfolio. Management quarterly evaluates the allowance for loan losses to ensure the level is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio. This evaluation is based on a continuous review of the loan portfolio, both individually and by category, and includes consideration of changes in the mix and volume of the loan portfolio, actual loan loss experience and loan loss trends, the financial condition of the borrowers, industry and geographical exposures within the portfolio, economic conditions and employment levels of the Corporations local markets, and special factors affecting business sectors. A formal evaluation of the allowance for loan losses is prepared quarterly to assess the risk in the loan portfolio and to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The Corporations loan review function is independent of the loan origination function and reviews the formal evaluation of the allowance for loan losses at least annually. The Corporations loan review function was performed by internal staff in 2008 and 2007 and a combination of internal staff and third-party consulting firms during 2006. Loan review performs a detailed credit quality review at least annually on commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans, particularly focusing on larger balance loans and loans that have deteriorated below certain levels of credit risk. The provision for loan losses was $49.2 million in 2008, $11.5 million in 2007 and $5.2 million in 2006. The Corporation experienced net loan charge-offs of $31.6 million in 2008, $6.2 million in 2007 and $5.7 million in 2006. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 1.10% in 2008, 0.22% in 2007 and 0.20% in 2006. The increase in net loan charge-offs in 2008 22 Table of Contents occurred primarily in the commercial loan types (commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction loans), although net loan charge-offs were higher in all loan categories in 2008, compared to 2007, and reflected the general deterioration in credit quality across the entire loan portfolio. Net loan charge-offs in 2008 included a significant loss attributable to the identification of a fraudulent loan transaction related to a single borrower with an aggregate loan balance of $10.3 million. The Corporation recovered $1.2 million in 2008 through the sale of collateral securing the loan, resulting in a $9.1 million net loan charge-off related to this one borrower, which represented 29% of total net loan charge-offs in 2008. Net loan charge-offs of commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction loans totaled $25.0 million in 2008 and represented 79% of total net loan charge-offs during the year. The commercial loan type net loan charge-offs were not concentrated in any one industry or borrower, except for the fraudulent loan customer net loan loss of $9.1 million, discussed above, and $5.4 million of net loan charge-offs attributable to residential real estate development loans. The Corporations provision for loan losses in 2008 of $49.2 million was $17.6 million higher than net loan charge-offs in 2008 and $37.7 million higher than the provision for loan losses in 2007. The level of the provision for loan losses in 2008 was primarily reflective of credit deterioration in 2008 that was driven by higher net loan charge-offs, an increase in the valuation allowance on impaired loans, an increase in nonperforming loans, an increase in loan delinquencies, and adverse changes in certain risk grade categories of the commercial and real estate commercial loan portfolios. The level of the provision in 2008 was also slightly impacted by loan growth during the year, as total loans increased $182 million, or 6.5%. The increase in net loan charge-offs was directly related to declining real estate values within the state of Michigan during 2008, as evidenced by both lower appraised values of real estate and lower sales prices of real estate. It is managements opinion that the overall credit deterioration in the Corporations loan portfolio in 2008 was largely reflective of the economic environment in the state of Michigan, as the unemployment rate increased throughout the year to over 10% by the end of the year. The Corporations loan portfolio had no concentration in the automotive sector and management had identified its direct exposure to this industry as not material, although the economic impact of the depressed automotive sector spilled over to the general economy within Michigan during 2008. Further, it has been publicized nationally that the residential real estate development industry was one of the industries most affected by the recessionary economy during 2008 and, accordingly, the Corporation experienced $5.4 million of net loan charge-offs in this industry in 2008. In addition, the Corporations loan portfolio included 24 residential real estate developers with outstanding contractual balances totaling $17.7 million that are experiencing significant cash flow difficulties and resulted in these loan relationships being classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2008, with $17.6 million in nonaccrual status and impaired at that date. At December 31, 2008, management evaluated the underlying collateral value of the $17.6 million in impaired residential real estate development loans and determined valuation allowances of $1.4 million were required on $3.3 million of these loans, as the value of the underlying collateral was assessed to be less than the carrying value of the loans. The Corporation also partially charged off $3.1 million of these impaired residential real estate development loans during 2007 and 2008. Impaired residential real estate development loans at December 31, 2008 of $17.6 million were largely concentrated in loans to seven developers having individual loan balances exceeding $1 million that totaled $14.3 million. The allowance provides for probable losses that have been identified with specific customer relationships and for probable losses believed to be inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio but that have not been specifically identified. The allowance for loan losses is comprised of valuation allowances (assessed for loans that have known credit weaknesses), allowances based on assigned risk ratings, general allowances on the remainder of the loan portfolio based primarily on historical loan loss experience and loan loss trends, and an unallocated allowance for the imprecision in the subjective nature of the specific and general allowance methodology. Factors contributing to the determination of valuation allowances include the financial condition of the borrower, changes in the value of pledged collateral and general economic conditions. The Corporation establishes the allowance allocations by the application of projected loss percentages to adversely-graded commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans by grade categories. General allowances are allocated to all other loans by loan category, based on a defined methodology that focuses on loan loss experience and trends. Allowance allocations to loan categories are developed based on historical loss and past due trends, managements judgment concerning those trends and other relevant factors, including delinquency, default and loss rates, as well as general economic conditions. Some loans will not be repaid in full. Therefore, the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents managements best estimate of inherent losses within the loan portfolio. In determining the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses, the Corporation considers four principal elements: (i) valuation allowances based upon probable losses identified during the review of impaired commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loan portfolios, (ii) allocations established for adversely-rated commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans and nonaccrual real estate residential and nonaccrual consumer loans, (iii) allocations on all other loans based principally on historical loan loss experience and loan loss, delinquency and risk rating trends, and (iv) an unallocated allowance based on the imprecision in the overall allowance methodology. 23 Table of Contents The first element reflects the Corporations estimate of probable losses based upon the systematic review of impaired commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial adversely-graded loans. These estimates are based upon a number of objective factors, such as payment history, financial condition of the borrower and discounted collateral exposure. The Corporation measures the investment in an impaired loan based on one of three methods: the loans observable market price, the fair value of the collateral, or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate. The second element reflects the application of the Corporations loan grading system. This grading system is similar to those employed by state and federal banking regulators. Commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans that are risk rated below a certain predetermined risk grade and nonaccrual real estate residential and nonaccrual consumer loans are assigned a loss allocation factor that is based upon a historical analysis of losses incurred within the specific risk grade category. The lower the grade assigned to a loan or category, the greater the allocation percentage that is generally applied. The third element is determined by assigning allocations based principally upon the three-year average of loss experience for each type of loan. Average losses may be adjusted based on current loan loss and delinquency trends and for the projected impact of loans acquired in branch and bank acquisitions. Loan loss analyses are performed quarterly. The fourth element is based on factors that cannot be associated with a specific credit or loan category and reflects an attempt to ensure that the overall allowance for loan losses appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision necessarily inherent in the estimates of expected loan losses. Management maintains an unallocated allowance to recognize the uncertainty and imprecision underlying the process of estimating projected loan losses. Determination of the probable losses inherent in the portfolio, which are not necessarily captured by the allocation methodology discussed above, involves the exercise of judgment. The unallocated allowance associated with the imprecision in the risk rating system is based on a historical evaluation of the accuracy of the risk ratings associated with loans. This unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses is judgmentally determined and generally serves to compensate for the uncertainty in estimating losses, particularly in times of changing economic conditions, and also considers the possibility of improper risk ratings. The unallocated allowance considers the lagging impact of historical charge-off ratios in periods where future loan charge-offs are expected to increase, trends in delinquencies and nonaccrual loans, the changing portfolio mix in terms of collateral, average loan balance, loan growth, the degree of seasoning in the various loan portfolios, and loans recently acquired through acquisitions. The unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses also takes into consideration economic conditions within the state of Michigan and nationwide, including unemployment levels, industry-wide loan delinquency rates, and in 2008, declining commercial and residential real estate values and historically high inventory levels of residential lots, condominiums and single family houses held for sale. The Corporations allowance was $57.1 million at December 31, 2008 and represented 1.91% of total loans, compared to $39.4 million, or 1.41%, of total loans at December 31, 2007 and $34.1 million, or 1.21%, of total loans at December 31, 2006. The underlying credit quality of the Corporations real estate residential and consumer loan portfolios is dependent primarily on each borrowers ability to continue to make required loan payments and, in the event a borrower is unable to continue to do so, the value of the collateral, if any, securing the loan. A borrowers ability to pay typically is dependent primarily on employment and other sources of income, which in turn is impacted by general economic conditions, although other factors may also impact a borrowers ability to pay. At December 31, 2008, with the unemployment rate in the state of Michigan at over 10%, more consumer borrowers became past due and the Corporation experienced higher real estate residential and consumer loan losses in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition, due to numerous economic and other factors, the Corporation experienced higher average individual loan losses in the real estate residential and consumer loan portfolios during 2008, due to more defaults that were largely attributable to higher unemployment levels within the state and lower fair values of collateral. During 2008, the Corporation sold 35 residential real estate properties that it obtained through the foreclosure process with net proceeds totaling $3 million and realized an average loss of 29% of the remaining loan balance on these properties. In 2008, the Corporation realized net proceeds of $1.4 million from the sale of repossessed assets and realized an average loss of 58% of the remaining loan balance on these assets. Further, due to significant declines in real estate property values, the Corporation experienced an increase in loan charge-offs on home equity loans. On an average basis, these loan losses were relatively low in 2008 at 55 basis points of total home equity loans, or $1.3 million. However, the Corporation realized approximately $1.2 million in loan losses on home equity consumer loans that represented 100% of the remaining loan balance, as there was no remaining equity in the customers homes. Impaired loans were $59.0 million at December 31, 2008, $45.9 million at December 31, 2007 and $19.8 million at December 31, 2006. After analyzing the various components of the customer relationships and evaluating the underlying collateral of impaired loans, it was determined that $30.3 million of impaired loans at December 31, 2008 required a valuation allowance, compared to $22.2 million at December 31, 2007 and $3.8 million at December 31, 2006. The valuation allowance allocated to impaired loans was $9.2 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $4.6 million at December 31, 2007 and $0.9 million at December 31, 2006. 24 Table of Contents Impaired loans are partially charged off when the impairment is deemed an inherent loss. Impaired loans with carrying values totaling $15.2 million at December 31, 2008 were net of $10.1 million in partial loan charge-offs, resulting in the total carrying values of these impaired loans as a percentage of the remaining contractual loan balances being an average of 60% at year-end. These impaired loans had no valuation allowance at December 31, 2008. While a significant percentage of impaired loans at December 31, 2008 had been partially charged off or had a valuation allowance assigned to the loan, there were impaired loans totaling $13.5 million for which the Corporation determined the contractual balance of the loan was less than the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the loan, and therefore neither a valuation allowance nor a partial loan charge-off was required for these loans. The process of measuring the fair value of impaired loans and the allocation of the allowance for loan losses requires judgment and estimation; therefore, the eventual outcome may differ from the estimates used on these loans. Continued severe economic conditions and/or declining property values could result in higher loan losses, which could result in the need for a higher allowance for loan losses. Economic conditions in the Corporations markets, all within Michigan, were generally less favorable than those nationwide during 2008. Forward-looking indicators suggest these economic conditions will continue into 2009. The allocation of the allowance for loan losses in Table 9 is based upon ranges of estimates and is not intended to imply either limitations on the usage of the allowance or exactness of the specific amounts. The entire allowance is available to absorb future loan losses without regard to the categories in which the loan losses are classified. The allocation of the allowance is based upon a combination of factors, including historical loss factors, credit-risk grading, past-due experiences, and the trends in these, as well as other factors, as discussed above.

Noninterest income declined $2.1 million, or 4.8%, in 2008 compared to 2007 and increased $3.2 million, or 7.8%, in 2007 compared to 2006. Noninterest income as a percentage of net revenue (net interest income plus noninterest income) was 22.1% in 2008, 25.0% in 2007 and 23.3% in 2006. The following schedule includes the major components of noninterest income during the past three years: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Service charges on deposit accounts $ 20,048 $ 20,549 $ 20,993 Trust and investment services revenue 10,625 11,325 10,378 Other fees for customer services 2,511 3,031 3,068 ATM and network user fees 3,341 2,968 2,707 Insurance commissions 1,042 773 778 Mortgage banking revenue 1,836 2,117 1,742 Investment securities net gains (losses) 1,278 4 (1,330 ) Gains on sales of branch bank properties 295 912  Insurance settlement  1,122  Gains on sale of acquired loans   1,053 Other 221 487 758 Total Noninterest Income $ 41,197 $ 43,288 $ 40,147 Service charges on deposit accounts were $20.0 million in 2008, $20.5 million in 2007 and $21.0 million in 2006. The decline of $0.5 million, or 2.4%, in 2008 and the decline of $0.5 million, or 2.1%, in 2007 were primarily attributable to a lower level of customer activity in areas where fees and service charges are applicable and customers choosing alternative non-fee based accounts. Trust and investment services revenue was $10.6 million in 2008, $11.3 million in 2007 and $10.4 million in 2006. The decrease in trust and investment services revenue of $0.7 million, or 6.2%, in 2008, as compared to 2007, resulted from declines in U.S. equity markets, which reduced the market value of assets under management. If the equity markets do not rebound and assets under management do not increase in 2009, the Corporation estimates trust and investment services revenue could decline approximately $2 million in 2009, as calculated using historical average fees as a percentage of average assets under management. The $0.9 million, or 9.1%, increase in trust and investment services revenue in 2007, as compared to 2006, was attributable to higher assets under management that was primarily attributable to positive investment returns in the U.S. equity markets and higher sales of investment products under the Corporations CFC Investment Center program. Other fees for customer services were $2.5 million in 2008, $3.0 million in 2007 and $3.1 million in 2006. The decline of $0.5 million, or 17.2%, in 2008 was primarily attributable to a $0.5 million decrease in float income earned on the sale of bank money orders to customers. The decrease in short-term interest rates lowered the amount of income earned on float balances during 2008. Other fees for customer services in 2007 were approximately the same as in 2006. ATM and network user fees were $3.3 million in 2008, $3.0 million in 2007 and $2.7 million in 2006. ATM and network user fees increased $0.4 million, or 12.6%, in 2008 due primarily to increased debit card activity. ATM and network user fees increased $0.3 million, or 9.6%, in 2007 due primarily to a $0.3 million, or 53.6%, decline in the reserve for debit card reward points that was attributable to the retirement of inactive points. Insurance commissions were $1.0 million in 2008, $0.8 million in 2007 and $0.8 million in 2006. The increase of $0.2 million, or 34.8%, in 2008 was primarily attributable to increases in closing fees and title insurance premium income due to a significant increase in mortgage loan closing activity. Insurance commissions in 2007 were approximately the same as in 2006, due to lower title insurance commissions being partially offset by higher credit life insurance income. Mortgage banking revenue (MBR) was $1.8 million in 2008, $2.1 million in 2007 and $1.7 million in 2006. During 2008, the Corporation sold $145 million of real estate residential loans in the secondary market, compared to $136 million in 2007 and $118 million in 2006. During the three years ended December 31, 2008, the majority of residential mortgages originated with interest rates fixed for time periods greater than ten years were sold in the secondary market. The decline in MBR in 2008, compared to 2007, was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average net gain on sales of loans and an increase in costs associated with selling loans in the secondary market. The increase in MBR in 2007, compared to 2006, was primarily attributable to an increase in the amount of loans sold. 26 Table of Contents During the second quarter of 2008, the Corporation realized a $1.7 million gain related to the sale of 92% of the Corporations MasterCard Class B shares, which had no cost basis. The $1.7 million gain was partially offset by the Corporations recognition of a $0.4 million other-than-temporary impairment loss of a single issue corporate bond in the Corporations available-for-sale investment securities portfolio during the third quarter of 2008. The Corporation recognized losses on the sale of investment securities of $1.3 million in 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Corporation sold $68 million of U.S. Treasury and government sponsored agency investment securities scheduled to mature in 2007 and 2008 that had an average yield of 3.12% and realized a $1.3 million loss. The Corporation had a significant volume of investment securities maturing in 2007 and management deemed it prudent to sell and reinvest a portion of these securities during 2006 as part of its interest rate risk management program. The proceeds from the sale were reinvested in U.S. Treasury and government sponsored agency investment securities with an average life of 3 years and an average yield of 4.81%. During 2008, the Corporation realized $0.3 million in gains on the sales of two branch office buildings. During 2007, the Corporation realized $0.9 million in gains on the sales of a branch office building and a parcel of excess land contiguous to an existing branch office. During 2007, the Corporation recognized $1.1 million in nonrecurring noninterest income from an insurance settlement due to damage to a branch building from a fire in an adjacent structure. During 2006, the Corporation recognized $1.1 million in gains on the sale of $14 million in long-term fixed interest rate real estate residential mortgage loans that were acquired in the 2006 branch transaction. Noninterest income, excluding nonrecurring sources of revenue from the insurance settlement, gains on sales of branch bank properties, investment securities net gains and losses and the gains on the sale of acquired loans, was $39.6 million in 2008, $41.2 million in 2007 and $40.4 million in 2006. Noninterest income, excluding these nonrecurring items, decreased $1.6 million, or 3.9%, in 2008 and increased $0.8 million, or 2.0%, in 2007. The decline in 2008, compared to 2007, was primarily attributable to decreases in service charges on deposit accounts, trust and investment services revenue, other fees for customer services, mortgage banking revenue and other miscellaneous income being partially offset by increases in ATM and network user fees and insurance commissions. The increase in 2007, compared to 2006, was primarily attributable to increases in trust and investment services revenue, ATM and network user fees and mortgage banking revenue being partially offset by a decline in service charges on deposit accounts and other miscellaneous income. 27 Table of Contents OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses were $109.1 million in 2008, $104.7 million in 2007 and $97.9 million in 2006. The following schedule includes the major categories of operating expenses during the past three years: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and wages $ 48,713 $ 48,651 $ 44,959 Employee benefits 10,514 10,357 11,053 Occupancy 10,221 10,172 9,534 Equipment 9,230 8,722 8,842 Postage and courier 3,169 2,841 2,599 Supplies 1,482 1,544 1,335 Professional fees 3,554 4,382 2,645 Outside processing/service fees 3,219 3,495 2,141 Michigan business taxes (806 ) 1,132 1,391 Advertising and marketing 2,492 1,854 1,645 Intangible asset amortization 1,543 1,786 2,087 Telephone 2,186 1,829 1,868 Other real estate and repossessed asset expenses 4,680 2,207 2,482 Loan and collection 1,592 702 417 Non-loan losses 1,473 605 298 Other 5,846 4,392 4,578 Total Operating Expenses $ 109,108 $ 104,671 $ 97,874 Full-time equivalent staff (at December 31) 1,416 1,368 1,443 Efficiency ratio 57.8 % 59.6 % 56.1 % Operating expenses were $109.1 million in 2008, an increase of $4.4 million, or 4.2%, compared to 2007. Operating expenses were $104.7 million in 2007, an increase of $6.8 million, or 6.9%, compared to 2006. The increase in 2008 was primarily due to increases in other real estate and repossessed asset expenses, loan and collection expenses and other operating expenses that were partially offset by decreases in Michigan business taxes and professional fees. The increase in 2007, compared to 2006, was primarily due to increases in salaries and wages, professional fees and outside processing/service fees. Total operating expenses as a percentage of total average assets were 2.88% in 2008, 2.77% in 2007 and 2.60% in 2006. Salaries, wages and employee benefits remain the largest components of operating expenses. These compensation expenses totaled $59.2 million in 2008, $59.0 million in 2007 and $56.0 million in 2006. Salaries and wages expense in 2008 was up only slightly over 2007 as higher costs attributable to merit salary increases, new positions, higher mortgage loan originator commissions and higher share-based compensation expense were almost entirely offset by savings associated with the 2007 reorganization. Salaries and wages expense increased $3.7 million, or 8.2%, in 2007, compared to 2006, due to $1.7 million in reorganization costs and $2.0 million of additional compensation costs attributable to new positions, annual merit compensation increases and higher share-based compensation expense. Compensation expenses as a percentage of total operating expenses were 54.3% in 2008, 56.4% in 2007 and 57.2% in 2006. In April 2007, the Corporation announced an internal reorganization that centralized six operational departments and reduced back-office and management staff. The reorganization was complete at December 31, 2007. The Corporation recognized $1.7 million in compensation related expense during 2007 for severance and early retirement costs in conjunction with the internal reorganization. The $1.7 million in reorganization expense was comprised of $1.3 million in severance costs, $0.3 million of early retirement pension cost and $0.1 million of payroll taxes, included in salaries and wages. Compensation cost increases also resulted from the addition of personnel from the 2006 branch transaction and new branch banking offices opened in late 2006 and early 2007, and the addition of technical and professional positions that were added in 2007 to meet the Corporations strategic initiatives. Compensation cost increases were only partially offset by the reduction of salaries for severed employees as these staff reductions occurred mostly in the last four months of 2007. The Corporations number of employees, on a full-time equivalent basis, declined in total at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006, as a result of the reorganization. Employee benefits expense of $10.5 million in 2008 increased $0.2 million, or 1.5%, compared to 2007. The increase was primarily due to higher group health insurance costs. Employee benefits expense of $10.3 million in 2007 was $0.7 million, or 6.3%, lower than in 2006. The decline was primarily due to the transition from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan that began in 28 Table of Contents mid-2006. Pension costs (defined benefit and defined contribution plans combined) were $0.6 million, or 17.7%, lower in 2007, as compared to 2006. Based on SFAS No. 123(R) Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), the board of directors of the Corporation in December 2005 accelerated the vesting of certain unvested out-of-the-money nonqualified stock options previously awarded to employees, including executive officers, under the Corporations stock incentive compensation plan. The acceleration of the vesting of these options reduced non-cash compensation expense in 2006, 2007 and 2008 by $0.6 million, $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Occupancy expense of $10.2 million in 2008 was approximately the same as 2007. Building repair and maintenance costs increased $0.4 million in 2008, although this increase was mostly offset by the Corporation not incurring losses on the disposal of branches during 2008, compared to losses of $0.3 million in 2007. Occupancy expense increased $0.6 million, or 6.7%, in 2007 compared to 2006. This increase was largely due to the acquisition of two branches in August 2006 and the addition of four newly constructed branch banking offices in late 2006 and early 2007, which increased building repair and maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, depreciation and other occupancy expense. Depreciation expense recorded in occupancy expense was $2.3 million, $2.4 million and $2.2 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Equipment expense of $9.2 million in 2008 increased $0.5 million, or 5.8%, compared to 2007, due primarily to higher depreciation expense and higher teleprocessing line costs in association with significant upgrades made to telephone, teleprocessing and computer network equipment. Equipment expense of $8.7 million in 2007 declined $0.1 million, or 1.4%, from 2006, due primarily to lower depreciation expense being partially offset by higher third-party software maintenance expense. Depreciation expense on equipment was $3.5 million, $3.3 million and $3.5 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Professional fees of $3.6 million in 2008 were $0.8 million, or 18.9%, lower than in 2007. The decline in professional fees was attributable to lower consulting and legal fees compared to the prior year. Professional fees of $4.4 million in 2007 were $1.7 million, or 65.7%, higher than in 2006. The increase in professional fees was partially attributable to $0.6 million of consulting and legal fees related to corporate initiatives completed during the first quarter of 2007. In addition, during 2007, as compared to 2006, external accounting fees were $0.5 million higher and consulting fees for branch analysis were $0.4 million higher. Outside processing/service fees were $3.2 million in 2008, $3.5 million in 2007 and $2.1 million in 2006. The $0.3 million, or 7.9%, decrease in 2008, compared to 2007, was primarily attributable to slightly higher costs in 2007 associated with costs for third-party technical support used in the 2007 mainframe migration project described below and for network organization and security issues. The increase in outside processing/service fees of $1.4 million, or 63%, in 2007, compared to 2006, was primarily attributable to costs associated with a migration of the Corporations core processing mainframe technology to a system with greater capacity and flexibility, internet banking software support and third-party technical support. Michigan business taxes were $(0.8) million in 2008, $1.1 million in 2007 and $1.4 million in 2006. The Michigan Single Business Tax (SBT), which expired December 31, 2007, was replaced by the Michigan Business Tax (MBT). The MBT includes a provision for a Financial Institutions Tax (FIT), which applies to all banks, savings banks, bank holding companies and all of their affiliated companies and was effective January 1, 2008. The FIT is a tax on a financial institutions consolidated capital less both goodwill and certain debt obligations held by the financial institution using a five-year average. The MBT is not an income tax and therefore deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recorded related to this tax, which can result in moderate fluctuations in expense between years. The new MBT resulted in a reduction of the Corporations Michigan business tax expense during 2008, compared to SBT expense recorded in 2007. The decline in SBT expense in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to lower taxable income compared to the prior year. The decline in Michigan business tax expense in both 2008 and 2007 compared to 2006 was also due to the reversal of contingent tax reserves recorded for the SBT which were no longer required due to the expiration of the statutory audit period. These reversals totaled $0.9 million in 2008 and $0.4 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, SBT expenses of $0.5 million previously recorded were reversed during 2008 based on the successful results of a 2008 state tax audit. Other real estate and repossessed asset expenses were $4.7 million in 2008, $2.2 million in 2007 and $2.5 million in 2006. During 2008, the Corporation recorded write-downs to the carrying cost of other real estate to fair value, due to the general decline in real estate values of $3.0 million compared to $1.2 million in 2007. In addition, increases in maintenance and property tax expenses were incurred in 2008, compared to 2007, due to a significant increase in other real estate held in 2008, compared to 2007. Loan and collection expenses were $1.6 million in 2008, $0.7 million in 2007 and $0.4 million in 2006. The significant increases in these expenses in both 2008 and 2007 were attributable to the deterioration in the credit quality of the loan portfolio and increased costs associated with foreclosing on properties and obtaining title to properties securing loans that defaulted on payments. Advertising and marketing expenses of $2.5 million in 2008 were $0.6 million, or 34.4%, higher than in 2007. The increase was primarily due to an increase in market research expenses and print and television ad campaign costs. 29 Table of Contents Non-loan losses of $1.5 million in 2008 were $0.9 million, or 143%, higher than in 2007. The increase in 2008 was primarily attributable to a branch office loss of $0.8 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. Other categories of operating expenses include a wide array of expenses, including postage and courier, supplies, intangible asset amortization, telephone costs and other expenses, including FDIC insurance. In total, these other categories of operating expenses totaled $14.2 million in 2008, $12.4 million in 2007 and $12.5 million in 2006. The increase of $1.8 million, or 14.8%, in these operating expenses in 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily attributable to increases in postage and courier, telephone and other expenses, including FDIC insurance, being partially offset by a decrease in supplies and intangible asset amortization. During 2008, the Corporation utilized $1.4 million of available FDIC insurance assessment credits to offset a portion of the FDIC premium assessments of $2.0 million. During 2007, the Corporation utilized $1.8 million of assessment credits to offset all FDIC premium assessments for the year. Due to declines in the FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund, effective January 1, 2009, the FDIC increased the rate it will assess insured institutions. In addition, effective April 1, 2009, the FDIC has proposed a change to how it assesses institutions based on risk. As a result of both of these changes, the Corporation expects to pay FDIC premium assessments of 14 cents for every $100 of deposits, or approximately $4.2 million in 2009, compared to $0.6 million in 2007 and zero in 2006. The Corporations efficiency ratio, which measures total operating expenses divided by the sum of net interest income (FTE) and noninterest income, was 57.8% in 2008, 59.6% in 2007 and 56.1% in 2006. The decrease in 2008, compared to 2007, was attributable to significantly higher net interest income. The increase in 2007, compared to 2006, was attributable to higher operating expense and lower net interest income. INCOME TAXES The Corporations effective federal income tax rate was 29.5% in 2008, 31.8% in 2007 and 32.4% in 2006. The fluctuations in the Corporations effective federal income tax rate reflect changes each year in the proportion of interest income exempt from federal taxation, nondeductible interest expense and other nondeductible expenses relative to pretax income and tax credits. Based on the Corporations assessment of uncertain tax positions during 2008 and 2007, no adjustments to the federal income tax provision were required. In 2006, the Corporations provision for federal income taxes was reduced as a result of the reassessment of uncertain tax positions. The amount of the reduction in the provision for federal income taxes resulting from the reassessment of uncertain tax positions was $0.2 million in 2006. No uncertain tax positions were recorded as of December 31, 2006. Tax-exempt income (FTE), net of related nondeductible interest expense, totaled $6.5 million in 2008, $6.3 million in 2007 and $5.9 million in 2006. Tax-exempt income (FTE) as a percentage of total interest income (FTE) was 3.1% in 2008, 2.7% in 2007 and 2.7% in 2006. Income before income taxes (FTE) was $30.5 million in 2008, $59.5 million in 2007 and $71.4 million in 2006. LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity is the ability to meet financial obligations through the maturity or sale of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds. The Corporation has various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments, which may require future cash payments. The following contractual obligations schedule summarizes the Corporations noncancelable contractual obligations and future required minimum payments at December 31, 2008. Refer to Notes 10, 11, 12 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these contractual obligations. 30 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations December 31, 2008 Minimum Payments Due by Period Less than More than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Total (In thousands) Deposits with no stated maturity* $ 1,908,860 $  $  $  $ 1,908,860 Certificates of deposit with a stated maturity* 760,590 273,204 21,488 14,650 1,069,932 Short-term borrowings* 233,738    233,738 Federal Home Loan Bank advances  long-term* 45,025 65,000 25,000  135,025 Commitment to fund a low income housing partnership 230 350   580 Commitment to fund a private equity capital investment 1,000    1,000 Operating leases and noncancelable contracts 6,803 9,372 2,134 92 18,401 Total contractual obligations $ 2,956,246 $ 347,926 $ 48,622 $ 14,742 $ 3,367,536 * Deposits and borrowings exclude interest. The Corporation also has loan commitments that may impact liquidity. The following schedule summarizes the Corporations loan commitments and expiration dates by period at December 31, 2008. Since many of these commitments historically have expired without being drawn upon, the total amount of these commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the Corporation. Refer to Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these obligations.

Time deposits of $100,000 or more increased $38.0 million, or 12.8%, during 2008 to $336.0 million at December 31, 2008 and declined $57.7 million, or 16.2%, during 2007 to $297.9 million at December 31, 2007. There were no brokered deposits at December 31, 2008, 2007 or 2006. Time deposits of $100,000 or more represented 11.3%, 10.4% and 12.3% of total deposits at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. TABLE 10. MATURITY DISTRIBUTION OF TIME DEPOSITS OF $100,000 OR MORE December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Maturity: Within 3 months $ 156,577 47 % $ 129,801 44 % $ 210,717 59 % After 3 but within 6 months 48,511 14 50,191 17 57,038 16 After 6 but within 12 months 58,134 17 68,308 23 73,997 21 After 12 months 72,736 22 49,636 16 13,929 4 Total $ 335,958 100 % $ 297,936 100 % $ 355,681 100 % The Corporations largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the deposit base that comes from consumer, business and municipal customers within the Corporations local markets, principal payments on loans and federal funds sold. Other borrowed funds come from short- and long-term funding sources, primarily repurchase agreements with customers and borrowings from the 31 Table of Contents FHLB. Unused borrowing capacity, primarily from the FHLB, is also available to maintain the Corporations liquidity position. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation had $49.7 million of excess cash deposits held at the Federal Reserve Bank that were not invested in federal funds sold due to the low interest rate environment. Liquidity risk is the adverse impact on net interest income if the Corporation were unable to meet its funding requirements at a reasonable cost. The Corporation manages its liquidity to ensure that it has the ability to meet the cash withdrawal needs of its depositors, provide funds for borrowers and at the same time ensure that the Corporations own cash requirements are met. The Corporation accomplishes these goals through the management of liquidity at two levels  the parent company and the subsidiary bank. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, the parent companys primary source of funds was dividends from its sole subsidiary bank, Chemical Bank. The parent company manages its liquidity position to provide the cash necessary to pay dividends to shareholders, invest in new subsidiaries, enter new banking markets, pursue investment opportunities and satisfy other operating requirements. The long-term ability of the parent company to pay cash dividends to shareholders is dependent on the adequacy of capital and earnings of Chemical Bank. Federal and state banking laws place certain restrictions on the amount of dividends that a bank may pay to its parent company. During 2008, Chemical Bank paid dividends to the parent company of $59 million, including a one-time $30 million dividend in the fourth quarter for which it was necessary to receive approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). Dividends paid by Chemical Bank to the parent company in 2008 exceeded the subsidiarys earnings by $37.7 million and, at December 31, 2008, Chemical Bank could not pay additional dividends to the parent company without Federal Reserve approval. The parent company paid cash dividends to shareholders of $28.1 million in 2008. The parent companys cash increased $32 million during 2008 to $36.3 million at December 31, 2008, which it held in a deposit account at Chemical Bank as of that date. The parent company anticipates using the $30 million dividend received from Chemical Bank in the fourth quarter of 2008 to pay cash dividends to shareholders during 2009. The earnings of the Corporations subsidiary bank, Chemical Bank, have been the principal source of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders. Over the long term, cash dividends to shareholders are dependent upon earnings, as well as capital requirements, regulatory restraints and other factors affecting Chemical Bank. Due to the strength of the Corporations capital position, the parent company has the ability to continue to pay cash dividends to shareholders in excess of the earnings of Chemical Bank. The length of time the parent company could sustain cash dividends to shareholders in excess of the current earnings of Chemical Bank is dependent on the magnitude of any earnings shortfall and the capital levels of both Chemical Bank and the Corporation. During 2007, Chemical Bank paid dividends to the parent company of $49 million, compared to the subsidiarys earnings of $40 million that year. During 2007, the parent used the dividends from Chemical Bank to pay cash dividends to shareholders totaling $27.7 million and repurchased approximately 1 million shares of the Corporations common stock totaling $25.5 million, resulting in the parent companys cash declining $5.3 million during 2007 to $4.3 million at December 31, 2007. Chemical Bank can obtain funding through traditional short-term forms of borrowing, including federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements with customers. Chemical Bank can also borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicagos discount window to meet short-term liquidity requirements. These borrowings are required to be secured by investment securities and/or certain loan types, with each category of assets carrying various borrowing capacity percentages. At December 31, 2008, Chemical Bank maintained an unused borrowing capacity of approximately $20 million with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicagos discount window based upon pledged collateral as of that date, although it is managements opinion that this borrowing capacity could be significantly expanded, if deemed necessary, as Chemical Bank has a significant amount of additional assets that could be used as collateral at the discount window. Chemical Bank is a member of the FHLB and as such has access to short-term and long-term advances from the FHLB secured generally by residential mortgage loans. See Borrowed Funds, below, and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on advances from the FHLB. BORROWED FUNDS Borrowed funds include short-term borrowings and FHLB advances  long-term. Short-term borrowings are comprised of securities sold under agreements to repurchase with customers, reverse repurchase agreements and FHLB advances  short-term that have original maturities of one year or less. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are funds deposited by customers that were exchanged for investment securities that were owned by the Corporations subsidiary bank, as these borrowings were not covered by FDIC insurance. These funds have been a stable source of liquidity for the Corporations subsidiary bank, much like the subsidiary banks core deposit base. Reverse repurchase agreements are a means of raising funds in the capital markets by providing specific securities as collateral. During 2005, the Corporation entered into a $10 million reverse repurchase agreement with another financial institution by selling $11 million in U.S. treasury notes under an agreement to repurchase these notes. This reverse repurchase agreement was repaid during 2006. FHLB advances  short-term are generally used to fund short-term liquidity needs. FHLB advances, both short-term and long-term, are secured under a blanket security agreement of real estate residential first lien loans with an aggregate book value equal to at least 145% of the advances. Short-term borrowings are highly interest rate sensitive. Total short-term borrowings were $233.7 million at December 31, 2008, $197.4 million at December 31, 2007 and $209.0 million 32 Table of Contents at December 31, 2006. A summary of short-term borrowings for 2008, 2007 and 2006 is included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. Long-term borrowings, comprised solely of FHLB advances  long-term, were $135 million at December 31, 2008 and $150 million at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, FHLB advances  long-term that will mature in 2009 totaled $45 million. FHLB advances  long-term are borrowings that are generally used to fund loans and a portion of the investment securities portfolio. A summary of FHLB advances  long-term outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007 is included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due primarily to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is the Corporations primary market risk and results from timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities and changes in relationships between rate indices. Interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates. Consistency of the Corporations net interest income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of the Corporations business due to differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes arises when yields on assets change differently from the interest costs on liabilities. Interest rate sensitivity is determined by the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities repricing within a specific time period and the magnitude by which interest rates change on the various types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The management of interest rate sensitivity includes monitoring the maturities and repricing opportunities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate sensitivity management aims at achieving reasonable stability in both net interest income and the net interest margin through periods of changing interest rates. The Corporations goal is to avoid a significant decrease in net interest income and thus an adverse impact on the profitability of the Corporation in periods of changing interest rates. It is necessary to analyze projections of net interest income based upon the repricing characteristics of the Corporations interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the varying magnitude by which interest rates may change on loans, investment securities, interest-bearing deposit accounts and borrowings. The Corporations interest rate sensitivity is managed through policies and risk limits approved by the boards of directors of the Corporation and its subsidiary bank and an Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO). The ALCO, which is comprised of executive management from various areas of the Corporation, including finance, lending, investments and deposit gathering, meets regularly to execute asset and liability management strategies. The ALCO establishes guidelines and monitors the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates. The goal of the ALCO process is to maximize net interest income and the net present value of future cash flows within authorized risk limits. The Corporation has not used interest rate swaps or other derivative financial instruments in the management of interest rate risk, other than best efforts forward commitments utilized to offset the interest rate risk of interest rate lock commitments provided to customers on unfunded real estate residential loans intended to be sold in the secondary market. In the normal course of the mortgage loan selling process, the Corporation enters into a best efforts forward loan delivery commitment with an investor. The Corporations exposure to market risk on these best efforts forward loan delivery commitments is not significant. The primary technique utilized by the Corporation to measure its interest rate risk is simulation analysis. Simulation analysis forecasts the effects on the balance sheet structure and net interest income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in interest rates, the shape of the Treasury yield curve, interest rate relationships and the mix of assets and liabilities and loan prepayments. These forecasts are compared against net interest income projected in a stable interest rate environment. While many assets and liabilities reprice either at maturity or in accordance with their contractual terms, several balance sheet components demonstrate characteristics that require an evaluation to more accurately reflect their repricing behavior. Key assumptions in the simulation analysis include prepayments on loans, probable calls of investment securities, changes in market conditions, loan volumes and loan pricing, deposit sensitivity and customer preferences. These assumptions are inherently uncertain as they are subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic environment. As a result, the simulation analysis cannot precisely forecast the impact of rising and falling interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to many other factors, including changes in balance sheet components, interest rate changes, changes in market conditions and management strategies. Management performed various simulation analyses throughout 2008. The Corporations interest rate sensitivity is estimated by first forecasting the next twelve months of net interest income under an assumed environment of constant market interest rates. The Corporation then compares the results of various simulation analyses to the constant interest rate forecast. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Corporation projected the change in net interest income during the next twelve months assuming short-term market interest rates were to uniformly and gradually increase or decrease by up to 200 basis points over the same time period. These projections were based on the Corporations assets and liabilities remaining static over the next twelve months, while factoring in probable calls of U.S. agency securities and prepayments of mortgage-backed securities, real estate residential mortgage loans and certain consumer loans. Mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loan prepayment assumptions were developed from industry 33 Table of Contents averages of prepayment speeds, adjusted for the historical prepayment performance of the Corporations own loans. The Corporations forecasted net interest income sensitivity is monitored by the ALCO within established limits as defined in the Corporations funds management policy. The Corporations policy limits the adverse change of a 200 basis point increase or decrease in short-term interest rates over the succeeding twelve months to no more than five percent of managements most likely net interest income forecast. The Corporations mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities generally results in its interest rate position being liability sensitive. However, as the Corporation has not used interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments in the management of interest rate risk, its interest rate position changes depending on the length and magnitude by which interest rates change. Accordingly, with the significant reductions in short-term market interest rates in 2007 and 2008, and with interest rates at December 31, 2008 at historically low levels, the Corporation has limited ability to further reduce the interest rate on many interest-bearing deposit accounts if market interest rates further decline. However, if market interest rates further decline, the Corporation would experience lower loan and investment yields. Therefore, at December 31, 2008, the Corporations net interest income was expected to slightly increase if interest rates rose and moderately decrease if interest rates declined under a simulation of interest rates gradually increasing or decreasing up to 200 basis points in 2009, all other factors being unchanged. Summary information about the interest rate risk measures, as described above, at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 is presented below: Year-End 2008 Twelve Month Projection Interest Rate Change Projection (in basis points) −200 −100 0 +100 +200 Percent change in net interest income vs. constant rates (3.9 )% (1.8 )%  1.1 % 1.1 % Year-End 2007 Twelve Month Projection Interest Rate Change Projection (in basis points) −200 −100 0 +100 +200 Percent change in net interest income vs. constant rates 2.0 % 1.0 %  (1.2 )% (2.5 )% In 2008, the Corporation experienced an 11.7% increase in net interest income. Net interest income was favorably impacted by lower short-term interest rates during 2008 and modest growth in average loans in 2008 compared to 2007. The positive direction of the 2008 change in net interest income was consistent with the results from the 2007 simulation analysis. The analysis projected a positive change in net interest income if short-term market interest rates were to decline. There are many variables that influence net interest income and therefore actual results may vary significantly from projected results derived through simulation analysis. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Effective January 1, 2008, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities by providing a single definition for fair value, a framework for measuring fair value and expanding disclosures concerning fair value. SFAS 157 requires expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. SFAS 157 does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. The adoption of SFAS 157 did not have an impact on the Corporations consolidated financial condition or results of operations. On February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP 157-2). FSP 157-2 amends SFAS 157 to delay the effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (that is, at least annually). For items within its scope, FSP 157-2 defers the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Corporation elected not to delay the application of SFAS 157 to nonfinancial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. On October 10, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active (FSP 157-3). FSP 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in a market that is not active and applies to financial assets within the scope of accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements in accordance with SFAS 157. FSP 157-3 is effective upon issuance and includes prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued. The adoption of FSP 157-3 did not have an impact on the Corporations consolidated financial condition or results of operations. On January 12, 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. EITF 99-20-1, Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20 (FSP EITF 99-20-1). FSP EITF 99-20-1 amends the impairment guidance in EITF Issue No. 99-20, Recognition 34 Table of Contents of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to Be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets, to achieve more consistent determinations of whether an OTTI has occurred. FSP EITF 99-20-1 retains and emphasizes the objective of an OTTI assessment and the related disclosure requirements in SFAS 115 and other related guidance. FSP EITF 99-20-1 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2008. The adoption of FSP EITF 99-20-1 did not have an impact on the Corporations consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Under SFAS 157, fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts such sales or transfers. SFAS 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. In support of this principle, SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data, for example, the reporting entitys own data. Under SFAS 157, fair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements to record certain assets at fair value and to determine fair value disclosures. Investment securities  available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The Corporation may be required to record other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans, goodwill, other intangible assets, other real estate and repossessed assets. These nonrecurring fair value measurements typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. SFAS 157 establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect managements estimates about market data. Level 1 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 1 valuations for the Corporation include U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets. Valuations are obtained from a third-party pricing service for investment securities. Level 2 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Level 2 valuations for the Corporation include agency securities, including securities issued by the FHLBanks, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and Federal Farm Credit Bank (FFCB), securities issued by certain state and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and corporate bonds. Valuations are obtained from a third-party pricing service for investment securities. Level 3 Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models or similar techniques. The determination of fair value also requires significant management judgment or estimation. Level 3 valuations for the Corporation include securities issued by certain state and political subdivisions, trust preferred securities, impaired loans, goodwill, other intangible assets, other real estate and repossessed assets. For assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, it is the Corporations policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements, in accordance with the fair value hierarchy in SFAS 157. When available, the Corporation utilizes quoted market prices to measure fair value. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques that include market inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data and industry and economic events. All of the Corporations investment securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis use either Level 1 or Level 2 measurements to determine fair value. All of the Corporations assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis use Level 3 valuations. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, the 35 Table of Contents Corporation would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement. At December 31, 2008, $449.9 million, or 11.6%, of total assets consisted of investment securities  available-for-sale recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. All of these financial instruments used valuation methodologies involving market-based or market-derived information, or Level 1 and 2 valuations, to measure fair value. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation had no liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. At December 31, 2008, $64.8 million, or 1.7%, of total assets consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. All of these financial instruments used methodologies involving model-based techniques, or Level 3 valuations. At December 31, 2008, the financial assets measured using Level 3 valuations included certain impaired loans and certain other real estate and repossessed assets. At December 31, 2008, no liabilities were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Refer to Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of the Corporations use and development of fair value measurements. CAPITAL Capital supports current operations and provides the foundation for future growth and expansion. Total shareholders equity was $491.5 million at December 31, 2008, a decrease of $16.9 million, or 3.3%, from total shareholders equity of $508.5 million at December 31, 2007. Book value per common share at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $20.58 and $21.35, respectively. Shareholders equity decreased $8.3 million in 2008 as cash dividends paid to shareholders exceeded net income of the Corporation by this amount. Shareholders equity decreased another $11.0 million in 2008 attributable to a net increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss during the year. Accumulated other comprehensive loss is a component of shareholders equity. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss was primarily attributable to a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets. See Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding accumulated other comprehensive loss. Total shareholders equity was $508.5 million at December 31, 2007, an increase of $0.6 million, or 0.1%, from total shareholders equity of $507.9 million at December 31, 2006. Earnings retention (net income less cash dividends declared and paid) was $18.4 million in 2007. Additionally, shareholders equity included reductions in accumulated other comprehensive loss during 2007 that increased shareholders equity $7.2 million. The additions to shareholders equity were offset by a reduction in shareholders equity attributable to the repurchase of 1,023,000 shares of the Corporations common stock during 2007 at an average price of $24.94 per share, totaling $25.5 million. The ratio of shareholders equity to total assets was 12.7% at December 31, 2008, compared to 13.5% at December 31, 2007 and 13.4% at December 31, 2006. The Corporations tangible equity to assets ratio was 11.0%, 11.7% and 11.6% at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Under the regulatory risk-based capital guidelines in effect for both banks and bank holding companies, minimum capital levels are based upon perceived risk in the Corporations various asset categories. These guidelines assign risk weights to on- and off-balance sheet items in arriving at total risk-adjusted assets. Regulatory capital is divided by the computed total of risk-adjusted assets to arrive at the risk-based capital ratios. The Corporation continues to maintain a strong capital position which significantly exceeded the minimum levels prescribed by the Federal Reserve Board at December 31, 2008, as shown in the following schedule: December 31, 2008 Risk-Based Leverage Capital Ratios Ratio Tier 1 Total Chemical Financial Corporations capital ratios 11.6 % 15.1 % 16.4 % Regulatory capital ratios  well-capitalized definition 5.0 6.0 10.0 Regulatory capital ratios  minimum requirements 4.0 4.0 8.0 As of December 31, 2008, the Corporations subsidiary banks capital ratios also exceeded the minimum required of a well-capitalized institution, as defined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements. 36 Table of Contents From time to time, the board of directors approves common stock repurchase programs allowing management to repurchase shares of the Corporations common stock in the open market. The repurchased shares are available for later reissuance in connection with potential future stock dividends, the Corporations dividend reinvestment plan, employee benefit plans and other general corporate purposes. Under these programs, the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors, including the projected parent company cash flow requirements and the Corporations share price. A summary of the activity in the common stock repurchase programs during the three years ended December 31, 2008 follows. At December 31, 2005, 373,100 shares of common stock were available for repurchase under an April 2005 authorization from the board of directors. During 2006, 318,558 shares were repurchased under the Corporations repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of $9.3 million, resulting in 54,542 shares of common stock available for repurchase at December 31, 2006. During 2007, the board of directors authorized management to repurchase an additional one million shares of the Corporations common stock under a stock repurchase program and rescinded 31,542 remaining shares that existed at March 31, 2007 under the 2005 repurchase authorization. During 2007, 1,023,000 shares were repurchased under the Corporations repurchase programs for an aggregate purchase price of $25.5 million. At December 31, 2007, there were no shares of common stock available for repurchase. On January 22, 2008, the Corporation publicly announced that its board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to 500,000 shares of the Corporations common stock under a stock repurchase program. During 2008, no shares were repurchased under the January 2008 authorization. At December 31, 2008, there were 500,000 remaining shares available for repurchase under the January 2008 authorization. All repurchases during 2006 and 2007, except for one privately negotiated transaction for 21,458 shares in 2006, were made in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which provides a safe harbor for purchases in a given day if an issuer of equity securities satisfies the manner, timing, price and volume conditions of the rule when purchasing its own common shares in the open market. In addition, during 2008, 2007 and 2006, 38,416 shares, 9,017 shares and 39,036 shares, respectively, of the Corporations common stock were delivered or attested in satisfaction of the exercise price and/or tax withholding obligations by holders of employee stock options.

The system of internal control over financial reporting as it relates to the financial statements is evaluated for effectiveness by management and tested for reliability through a program of internal audits. Actions are taken to correct potential deficiencies as they are identified. Any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Management assessed the Corporations system of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Managements assessment is based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting as described in Internal Control  Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, its system of internal control over financial reporting was effective and meets the criteria of the Internal Control  Integrated Framework. The Corporations independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Corporations consolidated financial statements included in this annual report has issued an attestation report on the Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. David B. Ramaker Lori A. Gwizdala Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and President and Treasurer February 27, 2009 February 27, 2009 39 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Chemical Financial Corporation: We have audited Chemical Financial Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Chemical Financial Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Assessment as to the Effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Chemical Financial Corporations internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Chemical Financial Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial position of Chemical Financial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Detroit, Michigan February 27, 2009 40 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Chemical Financial Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Chemical Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the Corporation) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2008. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporations management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Chemical Financial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As discussed in Notes 2 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation changed its method of measuring prior-year uncorrected misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements and its method of accounting for defined benefit and postretirement obligations in 2006. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Chemical Financial Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporations internal control over financial reporting.

notes to consolidated financial statements. 45 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting and reporting policies of Chemical Financial Corporation (the Corporation) and its subsidiaries conform to United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and prevailing practices within the banking industry. Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the allowance for loan losses, pension expense, income taxes and goodwill. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant accounting policies of the Corporation and its subsidiaries are described below: Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements of the Corporation include the accounts of the parent company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant income and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. The Corporation consolidates variable interest entities (VIEs) in which it is the primary beneficiary. In general, a VIE is an entity that either (1) has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support, (2) has a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities, or (3) has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive return as generated by its operations. If any of these characteristics are present, the entity is subject to a variable interests consolidation model, and consolidation is based on variable interests, not on ownership of the entitys outstanding voting stock. Variable interests are defined as contractual, ownership, or other monetary interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entitys net asset value. The primary beneficiary consolidates the VIE; the primary beneficiary is defined as the enterprise that absorbs a majority of expected losses or receives a majority of residual returns (if the losses or returns occur), or both. The Corporation is a significant limited partner in one low income housing tax credit partnership that was acquired in 2001 as part of the merger with Shoreline Financial Corporation. This entity meets the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R) definition of a VIE. The Corporation is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE in which it holds an interest, and therefore the equity investment in the VIE is not consolidated in the financial statements. Exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with this entity at December 31, 2008 was limited to approximately $0.9 million recorded as the Corporations investment, which includes unfunded obligations to this project of $0.6 million. The Corporations investment in the project is recorded in interest receivable and other assets and the future financial obligation to this project is recorded in interest payable and other liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position at December 31, 2008. Reclassification: Certain amounts in the 2006 and 2007 consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation. Such reclassifications had no impact on shareholders equity or net income. Cash and Cash Equivalents: For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from unaffiliated banks and others and federal funds sold. Generally, federal funds are sold for one-day periods. Investment Securities: Investment securities include investments in debt and trust preferred securities. Investment securities are accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS 115). SFAS 115 requires investments to be classified within one of three categories (trading, held-to-maturity, or available-for-sale), based on the type of security and managements intent with regard to selling the security. The Corporation held no trading investment securities during the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. Designation as an investment security held-to-maturity is based on the Corporations intent and ability to hold the security to maturity. Investment securities held-to-maturity are stated at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premium and accretion of discount to maturity, based on the effective interest yield method. Investment securities that are not held-to-maturity are accounted for as securities available-for-sale, and are stated at estimated fair value, with the aggregate unrealized gains and losses, not deemed other-than-temporary, classified as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investment securities available-for-sale and other-than-temporary impairment changes are determined 46 Table of Contents using the specific identification method and are included within noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income. Premiums and discounts on investment securities available-for-sale are amortized over the estimated lives of the related investment securities based on the effective interest yield method. FASB Staff Position (FSP) 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP 115-1) addresses the determination of when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other-than-temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. The guidance in FSP 115-1 amends SFAS 115, SFAS 124, Accounting for Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. FSP 115-1 also replaced the impairment evaluation guidance (paragraphs 10-18) of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03-01, and superseded EITF Topic No. D-44, Recognition of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment upon the Planned Sale of a Security Whose Cost Exceeds Fair Value. The disclosure requirements of EITF Issue No. 03-01 remain in effect. FSP 115-1 clarified that an investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed other-than-temporary, even if a decision to sell an impaired security has not been made. The accounting guidance does not provide for an automatic conclusion that a security does not have other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) because all of the scheduled payments to date have been received. Therefore, the Corporation performs further analysis to assess whether a decline in fair value is temporary and that it is probable that the Corporation it will collect all of the contractual or estimated cash flows from the investment security. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5M, Other-than-Temporary Impairment of Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities states that the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost can indicate a decline is other-than-temporary. The longer and/or the more severe the decline in fair value, the more persuasive the evidence that is needed to overcome the premise that the holder will not collect all of the contractual or estimated cash flows from the investment security. Accordingly, in making an OTTI assessment, the Corporation considered all available information relevant to the collectibility of the investment security, including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, when developing the estimate of future cash flows. Other Securities: Other securities consisted of Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (FHLB) stock of $16.2 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) stock of $5.9 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007. Other securities are recorded at cost or par, which is deemed to be the net realizable value of these assets. The Corporation is required to own FHLB stock and FRB stock in accordance with its membership in these organizations. The FHLB requires its members to provide a five-year advance notice of any request to redeem FHLB stock. Loans: Loans are stated at their principal amount outstanding. Interest income on loans is reported based on the level-yield method and includes amortization of deferred loan fees and costs over the loan term. Net loan commitment fees for commitment periods greater than one year are deferred and amortized into fee income on a straight-line basis over the commitment period. Loan performance is reviewed regularly by loan review personnel, loan officers and senior management. Loan interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The past due status of a loan is based on the loans contractual terms. A loan is placed in the nonaccrual category when principal or interest is past due ninety days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection, or earlier when, in the opinion of management, there is sufficient reason to doubt the collectibility of principal or interest. Interest previously accrued, but not collected, is reversed and charged against interest income at the time the loan is placed in nonaccrual status. The subsequent recognition of interest income on a nonaccrual loan is then recognized only to the extent cash is received and where future collection of principal is probable. Loans are returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are brought current and collectibility is no longer in doubt. Nonperforming loans are comprised of those loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments. All nonaccrual commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans have been determined by the Corporation to meet the definition of an impaired loan. In addition, other commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans may be considered an impaired loan. A loan is defined to be impaired when it is probable that payment of principal and interest will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are carried at the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. A portion of the allowance for loan losses may be allocated to impaired loans. All impaired loans are evaluated individually to determine whether or not a valuation allowance is required. 47 Table of Contents Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market. The value of mortgage loans held for sale and other residential mortgage loan commitments to customers are hedged by utilizing best efforts forward commitments to sell loans to investors in the secondary market. Such forward commitments are generally entered into at the time when applications are taken to protect the value of the mortgage loans from increases in market interest rates during the period held. Mortgage loans originated are generally sold within a period of thirty to forty-five days after closing, and therefore the related fees and costs are not amortized during that period. The Corporation recognizes revenue associated with the expected future cash flows of servicing loans at the time a forward loan sales commitment is made, as required under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 109 Written Loan Commitments Recorded at Fair Value Through Earnings. Allowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses (allowance) represents managements assessment of probable losses inherent in the Corporations loan portfolio. Managements evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on a continuing review of the loan portfolio, actual loan loss experience, the underlying value of the collateral, risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, the level and composition of nonperforming loans, the financial condition of the borrowers, the balance of the loan portfolio, loan growth, economic conditions, employment levels in the Corporations local markets, and special factors affecting specific business sectors. The Corporation maintains formal policies and procedures to monitor and control credit risk. The allowance provides for probable losses that have been identified with specific customer relationships and for probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio, but that have not been specifically identified. Internal risk ratings are assigned to each commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loan at the time of approval and are subject to subsequent periodic reviews by senior management. The Corporation performs a detailed credit quality review quarterly on all large loans that have deteriorated below certain levels of credit risk, and may allocate a specific portion of the allowance to such loans based upon this review. A portion of the allowance is allocated to the remaining loans by applying projected loss ratios, based on numerous factors. Projected loss ratios incorporate factors such as recent charge-off experience, trends with respect to adversely risk-rated commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans, trends with respect to past due and nonaccrual loans and current economic conditions and trends and are supported by underlying analysis. This evaluation involves a high degree of uncertainty. Management maintains an unallocated allowance to recognize the uncertainty and imprecision underlying the process of estimating projected loan losses. Determination of the probable losses inherent in the portfolio, which are not necessarily captured by the allocation methodology discussed above, involves the exercise of judgment. The unallocated allowance associated with the imprecision in the risk rating system is based on a historical evaluation of the accuracy of the risk ratings associated with loans. The Corporation utilizes its own loss experience to estimate inherent losses on loans. Additional provisions for related losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, customer circumstances, changes in the value of underlying collateral and other credit risk factors. Although the Corporation periodically allocates portions of the allowance to specific loans and loan portfolios, the entire allowance is available for any loan losses that occur. Collection efforts may continue and recoveries may occur after a loan is charged against the allowance. Loans that are deemed not collectible are charged off and deducted from the allowance. The provision for loan losses and recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance. The allowance for loan losses is presented as a reserve against loans. Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment reflecting information available to them at the time of their examinations. Mortgage Banking Operations: The origination of real estate residential (mortgage) loans is an integral component of the business of the Corporation. The Corporation generally sells its originations of long-term fixed interest rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. Gains and losses on the sales of these loans are determined using the specific identification method. Long-term fixed interest rate residential mortgage loans originated for sale are generally held for forty-five days or less. The Corporation sells mortgage loans in the secondary market on either a servicing retained or released basis. Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or market on an aggregate basis. 48 Table of Contents The Corporation accounted for mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) in accordance with SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities (SFAS 140) until the adoption of SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets (SFAS 156), on January 1, 2007, which amended SFAS 140 with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities. SFAS 140 and SFAS 156 require that an asset be recognized for the rights to service mortgage loans, including those rights that are created by the origination of mortgage loans that are sold with the servicing rights retained by the originator. The recognition of the asset results in an increase in the gains recognized upon the sale of the mortgage loans sold. Under SFAS 156, the Corporation elected to amortize MSRs using the amortization method, which is similar to the method used under SFAS 140. The amortization method under SFAS 156 requires that MSRs be amortized in proportion to and over the period of net servicing income or net servicing loss and that the servicing assets or liabilities be assessed for impairment or increased obligation based on fair value at each reporting date. Prepayments of mortgage loans result in increased amortization of MSRs as the remaining book value of the MSRs is expensed at the time of prepayment. Any impairment of MSRs is recognized as a valuation allowance, resulting in a reduction of mortgage banking revenue. The valuation allowance is recovered when impairment that is believed to be temporary no longer exists. Other-than-temporary impairments are recognized if the recoverability of the carrying value is determined to be remote. When this occurs, the unrecoverable portion of the valuation allowance is recorded as a direct write-down to the carrying value of MSRs. This direct write-down permanently reduces the carrying value of the MSRs, precluding recognition of subsequent recoveries. For purposes of measuring fair value, the Corporation utilizes a third-party modeling software program. Servicing income is recognized in noninterest income when received and expenses are recognized when incurred. Premises and Equipment: Land is recorded at cost. Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Premises and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives are generally 25 to 39 years for buildings and three to ten years for all other depreciable assets. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Other Real Estate: Other real estate (ORE) is comprised of commercial and residential real estate properties, including development properties, obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations. ORE is recorded at the lower of cost or the estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs based upon the propertys appraised value at the date of transfer and managements estimate of the fair value of the collateral with any difference between the fair value of the property and the carrying value of the loan charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent changes in fair value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount, not to exceed the initial carrying value of the assets at the time of transfer. Changes in the fair value of ORE subsequent to transfer are recorded in other operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income. Gains or losses not previously recognized resulting from the sale of ORE are also recognized in other operating expenses on the date of sale. ORE totaling $19.5 million and $10.9 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, is included in the consolidated statements of financial position in interest receivable and other assets. Intangible Assets: Intangible assets consist of goodwill, core deposit intangible assets and MSRs. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), goodwill is no longer amortized, but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with SFAS 142, or more frequently if triggering events occur and indicate potential impairment. Core deposit intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from three to 15 years on a straight-line or accelerated basis, as applicable. MSRs are amortized in proportion to, and over the life of, the estimated net future servicing income. Share-based Compensation: Effective January 1, 2006, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), using the modified-prospective transition method. Under that method, compensation cost is recognized for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested, as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123). The resulting fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for share-based awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) and over the requisite service period for share-based awards granted after the adoption of SFAS 123(R). The requisite service period is the shorter of the vesting period or the period to retirement eligibility. 49 Table of Contents SFAS 123(R) requires the cash flows realized from the tax benefits of exercised stock option awards that result from actual tax deductions that are in excess of the recorded tax benefits related to the compensation expense recognized for those options (excess tax benefits) to be classified as financing cash flows. Short-term Borrowings: Short-term borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase with customers, reverse repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank advances  short-term. These borrowings have original scheduled maturities of one year or less. The Corporation sells certain securities under agreements to repurchase with customers. The agreements are collateralized financing transactions and the obligations to repurchase securities sold are reflected as a liability in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position. The dollar amount of the securities underlying the agreements remain in the asset accounts. Reverse repurchase agreements are a means of raising funds in the capital markets by purchasing certain securities under agreements to resell. See the description of Federal Home Loan Bank advances below. Federal Home Loan Bank Advances, Short-term and Long-term: Federal Home Loan Bank advances are borrowings from the FHLB to fund short-term liquidity needs as well as a portion of the loan and investment securities portfolios. These advances are secured under a blanket security agreement by first lien real estate residential loans with an aggregate book value equal to at least 145% of the FHLB advances. FHLB advances with an original maturity of one year or less are classified as short-term and FHLB advances with an original maturity of more than one year are classified as long-term. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plan Actuarial Assumptions: The Corporations defined benefit pension, supplemental pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts and measurements within the framework of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87) and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions (SFAS 106). Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or benefit obligation measurements. Other assumptions involve employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and the rate of compensation increase. The Corporation evaluates the critical and other assumptions annually. The discount rate enables the Corporation to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Corporation utilized the results from a bond matching technique to match cash flows of the defined benefit pension plan against both a bond portfolio derived from the S&P bond database of AA or better bonds and the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve to determine the discount rate. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension, supplemental pension and postretirement benefit expenses. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on defined benefit pension plan assets, the Corporation considers the current and expected asset allocation of the defined benefit pension plan, as well as historical and expected returns on each asset class. A lower expected rate of return on defined benefit pension plan assets will increase pension expense. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting For Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158). The Corporation adopted SFAS 158 on December 31, 2006, as required. The purpose of SFAS 158 is to improve the overall financial statement presentation of pension and other postretirement plans, but does not impact the determination of the net periodic benefit cost or measurement of plan assets or obligations. SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize the over- or under-funded status of a plan as an asset or liability as measured by the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation and requires any unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses to be recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). SFAS 158 also requires companies to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year-end. The Corporation utilized, and has historically utilized, a measurement date of December 31. Advertising Costs: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Income and Other Taxes: The Corporation is subject to the income and other tax laws of the United States and the state of Michigan. These laws are complex and are subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities. In determining the provision for income and other taxes, management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex laws, related 50 Table of Contents regulations and case law. In the process of preparing the Corporations tax returns, management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws. These interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on managements ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law. The Corporation and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The provision for federal income taxes is based on income and expenses, as reported in the consolidated financial statements, rather than amounts reported on the Corporations federal income tax return. When income and expenses are recognized in different periods for tax purposes than for book purposes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. On a quarterly basis, management assesses the reasonableness of its effective federal tax rate based upon its current best estimate of taxable income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reassessed on an annual basis, or sooner, if business events or circumstances warrant. Management also assesses the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis using information about the Corporations current and historical financial position and results of operations. Management expects to realize the full benefits of the deferred tax assets recorded at December 31, 2008. Effective January 1, 2007, the Corporation adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). Reserves for contingent tax liabilities are reviewed quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations or audits using the two-step approach for evaluating tax positions required by FIN 48. Recognition (step one) occurs when management concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (step two) is only addressed if step one has been satisfied (i.e., the position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained). Under step two, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48s use of the term more-likely-than-not in steps one and two is consistent with how that term is used in SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) (i.e., a likelihood of occurrence greater than 50 percent). Those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period in which they meet the more-likely-than-not standard, or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority, or upon expiration of the statute of limitations. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when management subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. FIN 48 specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions. Prior to the adoption of FIN 48, reserves for contingent tax liabilities were reviewed quarterly for adequacy and recorded based on SFAS 109. The Corporation recognizes any interest and penalties related to income tax uncertainties in the provision for income taxes. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Corporations consolidated financial condition and had no impact on the results of operations. Earnings Per Share: Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share (SFAS 128). All earnings per share amounts for all periods presented conform to the requirements of SFAS 128, including the effects of stock dividends. Basic earnings per share for the Corporation is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share for the Corporation is computed by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. The Corporations common stock equivalents consist of common stock issuable under the assumed exercise of dilutive stock options granted under the Corporations stock option plans, using the treasury stock method, stock to be issued under the deferred compensation plan for non-employee directors and stock to be issued under the stock purchase plan for non-employee advisors. The following summarizes the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the years ended December 31: 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands, except per share data) Numerator for both basic and diluted earnings per share, net income $ 19,842 $ 39,009 $ 46,844 Denominator for basic earnings per share, weighted average shares outstanding 23,840 24,360 24,921 Weighted average common stock equivalents 13 11 34 Denominator for diluted earnings per share 23,853 24,371 24,955 Basic earnings per share $ 0.83 $ 1.60 $ 1.88 Diluted earnings per share 0.83 1.60 1.88 51 Table of Contents The average number of employee stock option awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and therefore not included in the computation of earnings per share was 532,765, 534,256 and 403,361 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Comprehensive Income and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss: As required under SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income (SFAS 130), comprehensive income of the Corporation includes net income and an adjustment to equity for changes in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities available-for-sale and the difference between the fair value of pension and postretirement plan assets and their respective projected benefit obligations, net of income taxes, as required by SFAS 158. The Corporation displays comprehensive income as a component in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders equity. The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of related tax benefits, were as follows: December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net unrealized gains (losses) on investment securities available-for-sale, net of related tax (expense) benefit of $(1,610) at December 31, 2008, $(848) at December 31, 2007 and $2,142 at December 31, 2006 $ 2,990 $ 1,576 $ (3,977 ) Pension and other postretirement benefits expense, net of related tax benefit of $8,519 at December 31, 2008, $1,816 at December 31, 2007 and $2,677 at December 31, 2006 (15,821 ) (3,373 ) (4,973 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ (12,831 ) $ (1,797 ) $ (8,950 ) Operating Segment: The Corporation operates in a single operating segment  commercial banking. The Corporation is a financial holding company that operates through one commercial bank, Chemical Bank. Chemical Bank operates within the state of Michigan as a state-chartered commercial bank. Chemical Bank operates through an internal organizational structure of four regional banking units and offers a full range of commercial banking and fiduciary products and services to the residents and business customers in the banks geographical market areas. The products and services offered by the regional banking units, through branch banking offices, are generally consistent throughout the Corporation, as is the pricing of those products and services. The marketing of products and services throughout the Corporations regional banking units is generally uniform, as many of the markets served by the regional banking units overlap. The distribution of products and services is uniform throughout the Corporations regional banking units and is achieved primarily through retail branch banking offices, automated teller machines and electronically accessed banking products. The Corporations primary sources of revenue are from its loan products and investment securities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements: Business Combinations: In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)). SFAS 141(R) requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize most assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests at their fair values on the date of acquisition. Previously, these items were assigned values through a cost allocation process. SFAS 141(R) is effective prospectively for business combinations that occur in fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 141(R) as of January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on the Corporations consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Noncontrolling Interests: In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 requires a parent company to clearly identify ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, and to present these interests in the parents consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of income separate from the parents financial position and results of operations. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Adoption of SFAS 160 as of January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on the Corporations consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities: In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit-risk related contingent features in derivative agreements. SFAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 161 as of January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on the Corporations consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 52 Table of Contents Generally Accepted Accounting Principles Hierarchy: In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS 162). SFAS 162 identified a consistent framework, or hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP for nongovernmental entities and makes the GAAP hierarchy directly applicable to preparers of financial statements. SFAS 162 did not change the Corporations accounting practices. Intangible Assets: In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP 142-3). FSP 142-3 amends the factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). This new guidance applies prospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets in business combinations and asset acquisitions. FSP 142-3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. Since this guidance will be applied prospectively, adoption did not impact the Corporations current consolidated financial statements. In November 2008, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus 08-7, Accounting for Defensive Intangible Assets (EITF 08-7). EITF 08-7 clarifies how to account for acquired intangible assets in situations in which an entity does not intend to actively use the asset but intends to hold the asset to prevent others from obtaining access to the asset (a defensive intangible asset), except for intangible assets that are used in research and development activities. The consensus specifies that a defensive intangible asset should be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting and must be assigned a useful life in accordance with paragraph 11 of SFAS 142. EITF 08-7 is effective for intangible assets acquired on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Adoption of EITF 08-7 as of January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on the Corporations consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Share-Based Payments: In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03-6-1). FSP EITF 03-6-1 provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. FSP EITF 03-6-1 was effective on January 1, 2009. All previously reported earnings per share data will be retrospectively adjusted to conform to the provisions of FSP EITF 03-6-1. The adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1 on January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on the Corporations consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Postretirement Benefit Plan Asset Disclosures: In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP FAS 132(R)-1). FSP FAS 132(R)-1 amends SFAS No. 132(R), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits to provide guidance on an employers disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. Upon initial application, the provisions of FSP FAS 132(R)-1 are not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes. The disclosures about plan assets required by FSP FAS 132(R)-1 must be provided for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Corporations consolidated financial condition and results of operations. NOTE 2  ADOPTION OF CERTAIN GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet perspective (iron curtain approach) and income statement perspective (rollover approach) and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The Corporation historically used the rollover approach, which focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement, including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements. This approach quantifies misstatements based on the amount of the error originating in the current year income statement. The iron curtain approach considers the misstatements existing at each balance sheet date, irrespective of the period of origin of the misstatement. Upon adoption of SAB 108 on January 1, 2006, the Corporation determined that under the iron curtain approach, the quantitative cumulative misstatements aggregating approximately $4.6 million on a net basis that existed as of December 31, 2005 were material to the 2006 financial statements. As permitted when first applying the guidance in SAB 108, prior year financial statements were not restated. In accordance with the adoption of SAB 108, the Corporation recorded a $4.6 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $2.5 million, to retained earnings as of January 1, 2006. The net impact of the adoption of SAB 108 at January 1, 2006 was an increase in the Corporations shareholders equity of $0.18 per share at that date. 53 Table of Contents NOTE 3  MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS The Corporations primary method of expansion into new banking markets has been through acquisitions of other financial institutions and bank branches. During the three years ended December 31, 2008, the Corporation completed the following acquisition: In August 2006, the Corporation acquired two branch bank offices in Hastings and Wayland, Michigan from First Financial Bank, N.A., headquartered in Hamilton, Ohio, operating as Sand Ridge Bank (2006 branch transaction). The Corporation acquired deposits of $47 million, loans of $64 million and other miscellaneous assets of $1.7 million. The Corporation recorded goodwill of $6.8 million and core deposit intangible assets of $2.7 million. The core deposit intangible assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis over ten years. The loans acquired were comprised of $6 million in commercial loans, $13 million in real estate commercial loans, $38 million in real estate residential loans and $7 million in consumer loans. During December 2006, the Corporation sold $14 million of loans acquired in this transaction and recognized gains totaling approximately $1 million. The loans sold were long-term fixed interest rate real estate residential loans. NOTE 4  INVESTMENT SECURITIES The following is a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity at December 31, 2008 and 2007: Investment Securities Available-for-Sale: Amortized Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Fair Value (In thousands) December 31, 2008 U.S. Treasury $ 21,066 $ 428 $  $ 21,494 Government sponsored agencies 167,618 4,616  172,234 State and political subdivisions 4,458 94  4,552 Mortgage-backed securities 167,133 2,401 320 169,214 Collateralized mortgage obligations 37,527 30 272 37,285 Corporate bonds 47,545 23 2,400 45,168 Total $ 445,347 $ 7,592 $ 2,992 $ 449,947 December 31, 2007 U.S. Treasury $ 30,924 $ 526 $  $ 31,450 Government sponsored agencies 191,889 2,237 168 193,958 State and political subdivisions 6,391 125 2 6,514 Mortgage-backed securities 215,656 1,041 977 215,720 Collateralized mortgage obligations 567 9 1 575 Corporate bonds 54,919 22 389 54,552 Total debt securities 500,346 3,960 1,537 502,769 Equity securities 502   502 Total $ 500,848 $ 3,960 $ 1,537 $ 503,271 Investment Securities Held-to-Maturity: Amortized Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Fair Value (In thousands) December 31, 2008 Government sponsored agencies $ 1,007 $ 10 $  $ 1,017 State and political subdivisions 85,495 845 1,170 85,170 Mortgage-backed securities 509 27  536 Trust preferred securities 10,500  6,667 3,833 Total $ 97,511 $ 882 $ 7,837 $ 90,556 December 31, 2007 Government sponsored agencies $ 18,718 $  $ 77 $ 18,641 State and political subdivisions 71,899 488 33 72,354 Mortgage-backed securities 626 36  662 Total $ 91,243 $ 524 $ 110 $ 91,657 54 Table of Contents The following is a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of investment securities at December 31, 2008, by maturity, for both available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities. The maturities of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are based on scheduled principal payments. The maturities of all other debt securities are based on final contractual maturity.

Gross realized gains on investment securities transactions during 2008 were $1.7 million. In addition, the Corporation recognized $0.4 million of loss related to the write-down of unrealized losses that were deemed to be other-than-temporary in 2008. The Corporation realized a $1.7 million gain in 2008 on the sale of 92% of its MasterCard Class B shares that had no cost basis. The remaining Class B shares held by the Corporation were not redeemable at December 31, 2008, and therefore had no fair value at that date. The remaining Class B shares have no cost basis. Gross realized losses on investment securities transactions during 2006 were $1.3 million. An analysis is performed quarterly by the Corporation to determine whether unrealized losses in its investment securities portfolio are temporary or other-than-temporary. The Corporation reviews factors such as financial statements, credit ratings, news releases and other pertinent information of the underlying issuer or company to make its determination. Management did not believe any individual unrealized loss as of December 31, 2008 represented an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Management believed that the unrealized losses on investment securities were temporary in nature and due primarily to changes in interest rates and not as a result of credit-related issues. There were unrealized losses of $1.6 million in investment grade corporate bonds attributable to one issuer and $6.35 million in a trust preferred security from a well-capitalized and profitable bank holding company that were also attributable to the illiquidity in certain financial markets. The Corporation performed a thorough analysis of the creditworthiness of these two issuers and concluded it was probable at December 31, 2008 that all future principal and interest payments would be received in accordance with their original contractual terms. The Corporation had both the intent and ability to hold the investment securities with unrealized losses to maturity or until such time as the unrealized losses recover. However, due to significant market and economic conditions, additional OTTI may occur as a result of material declines in fair value in the future. The Corporation did not have a trading portfolio during the three years ended December 31, 2008. 55 Table of Contents The following summarizes information about investment securities with gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2008, excluding those for which OTTI charges have been recognized, aggregated by category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position.

These loans were made in the ordinary course of business upon normal terms, including collateralization and interest rates prevailing at the time and did not involve more than the normal risk of repayment by the borrower or present other unfavorable features. The aggregate loans outstanding to the directors, executive officers and their affiliates totaled approximately $14.9 million at December 31, 2008 and $10.2 million at December 31, 2007. During 2008, there were approximately $25.7 million of new loans and other additions, while repayments and other reductions totaled approximately $21.0 million. Loans held for sale, comprised of real estate residential loans, were $8.5 million at December 31, 2008, $7.9 million at December 31, 2007 and $5.7 million at December 31, 2006. 56 Table of Contents Changes in the allowance for loan losses were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Balance at beginning of year: $ 39,422 $ 34,098 $ 34,148 Provision for loan losses 49,200 11,500 5,200 Loan charge-offs (33,942 ) (6,988 ) (6,645 ) Loan recoveries 2,376 812 995 Net loan charge-offs (31,566 ) (6,176 ) (5,650 ) Allowance of business acquired   400 Balance at end of year $ 57,056 $ 39,422 $ 34,098 A summary of nonperforming loans follows: December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Nonaccrual loans: Commercial $ 16,324 $ 10,961 $ 4,203 Real estate commercial 27,344 19,672 9,612 Real estate construction 15,310 12,979 2,552 Real estate residential 12,175 8,516 2,887 Consumer 5,313 3,468 985 Total nonaccrual loans 76,466 55,596 20,239 Accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments: Commercial 1,652 1,958 1,693 Real estate commercial 9,995 4,170 2,232 Real estate construction 759  174 Real estate residential 3,369 1,470 1,158 Consumer 1,087 166 1,414 Total accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments 16,862 7,764 6,671 Total nonperforming loans $ 93,328 $ 63,360 $ 26,910 Interest income totaling $2.1 million in 2008, $1.8 million in 2007 and $0.7 million in 2006 was recorded on nonaccrual loans.

The Corporations goodwill impairment review is performed annually by management, or more frequently if triggering events occur and indicate potential impairment, and is additionally reviewed by an independent third-party appraisal firm. The income and fair value approach methodologies were utilized to estimate the value of the Corporations goodwill. The income approach quantifies the present value of future economic benefits by capitalizing or discounting the cash flows of a business. This approach considers projected dividends, earnings, dividend paying capacity and future residual value. The fair value approach estimates the value of the entity by comparing it to similar companies that have recently been acquired or companies that are publicly traded on an organized exchange. The estimate of fair value includes a comparison of the financial condition of the entity against the financial characteristics and pricing information of comparable companies. Based on the results of these valuations, the Corporations goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2008 or 2007. The following summarizes changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31: 2008 2007 (In thousands) Balance as of January 1 $ 69,908 $ 70,129 Adjustment due to the adoption of FIN 48  (221 ) Balance as of December 31 $ 69,908 $ 69,908 NOTE 8  ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS The following sets forth the carrying amounts, accumulated amortization and amortization expense of acquired intangible assets: December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Original Accumulated Carrying Original Accumulated Carrying Amount Amortization Amount Amount Amortization Amount (In thousands) Core deposit intangibles $ 18,033 $ 14,983 $ 3,050 $ 18,033 $ 13,440 $ 4,593 There were no additions of acquired intangible assets during 2008 and 2007.

The prepayment rates and the discount rate are the most significant factors affecting the MSRs valuation. Increases in mortgage loan prepayments reduce estimated future net servicing cash flows because the life of the underlying loan is reduced. Expected loan prepayment rates are validated by a third-party model. At December 31, 2008, the weighted average coupon rate of the portfolio was 5.98% and the discount rate was 8.5%. During 2008 and 2007, the Corporation did not record an impairment provision as there was no decline in the estimated fair value of MSRs compared to the recorded book value.

Time deposits with remaining maturities of one year or more were $309.3 million at December 31, 2008. The maturities of these time deposits are as follows: $234.6 million in 2010, $38.6 million in 2011, $17.8 million in 2012, $3.7 million in 2013 and $14.6 million thereafter. 59 Table of Contents NOTE 11  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS Maximum Weighted Average Average Amount Weighted Average Outstanding Ending Interest Rate At Outstanding Interest Rate at any Balance Year-End During Year During Year Month-End (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2008 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 233,738 0.48 % $ 196,155 1.09 % $ 233,738 FHLB advances  short-term   8,593 0.93 70,000 Total short-term borrowings $ 233,738 0.48 % $ 204,748 1.08 % December 31, 2007 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 197,363 3.08 % $ 181,766 3.77 % $ 203,322 FHLB advances  short-term   8,822 5.31 20,000 Total short-term borrowings $ 197,363 3.08 % $ 190,588 3.84 % December 31, 2006 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 178,969 3.91 % $ 152,003 3.66 % $ 178,969 Reverse repurchase agreements   4,109 3.74 10,000 FHLB advances  short-term 30,000 5.28 52,055 5.20 125,000 Total short-term borrowings $ 208,969 4.13 % $ 208,167 4.05 % NOTE 12  FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK ADVANCES  LONG-TERM FHLB advances  long-term outstanding as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 are presented below: December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Weighted Average Weighted Average Ending Interest Rate Ending Interest Rate Balance At Year-End Balance At Year-End (Dollars in thousands) FHLB advances  long-term: Fixed-rate advances $ 95,025 3.53 % $ 95,049 4.62 % Convertible fixed-rate advances 40,000 5.88 55,000 5.72 Total FHLB advances  long-term $ 135,025 4.22 % $ 150,049 5.02 % The FHLB advances, short-term and long-term, are collateralized by a blanket lien on qualified one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2008, the carrying value of these loans was $772 million. FHLB advances totaled $135 million at December 31, 2008, and were comprised solely of long-term advances. The Corporations additional borrowing availability, subject to the FHLBs credit requirements and policies, through the FHLB at December 31, 2008, based on the amount of FHLB stock owned, was $189 million. Prepayments of fixed-rate advances are subject to prepayment penalties under the provisions and conditions of the credit policy of the FHLB. The Corporation did not incur any prepayment penalties in 2008, 2007 or 2006. The FHLB has the option to convert the convertible fixed-rate advances to a variable interest rate each quarter. The Corporation has the option to prepay, without penalty, the FHLB convertible fixed-rate advance only when the FHLB exercises its option to convert it to a variable-rate advance. The FHLB did not exercise this option during 2008. During 2007, the FHLB exercised this option and the Corporation prepaid two advances totaling $15 million. 60 Table of Contents The scheduled principal reductions on FHLB advances  long-term outstanding at December 31, 2008 were as follows (in thousands): 2009 $ 45,025 2010 40,000 2011 25,000 2012  2013 25,000 Total $ 135,025 NOTE 13  COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS From time to time, the board of directors approves common stock repurchase programs allowing management to repurchase shares of the Corporations common stock in the open market. The repurchased shares are available for later reissuance in connection with potential future stock dividends, the Corporations dividend reinvestment plan, employee benefit plans and other general corporate purposes. Under these programs, the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors, including the projected parent company cash flow requirements and the Corporations share price. The following discussion summarizes the activity of the Corporations common stock repurchase programs during the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2005, 373,100 shares of common stock were available for repurchase under an April 2005 authorization from the board of directors. During 2006, 318,558 shares were repurchased under the Corporations repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of $9.3 million, resulting in 54,542 shares of common stock available for repurchase at December 31, 2006. During 2007, the board of directors authorized management to repurchase an additional one million shares of the Corporations common stock under a stock repurchase program, and rescinded 31,542 remaining shares that existed at March 31, 2007 under the 2005 repurchase authorization. During 2007, 1,023,000 shares were repurchased under the Corporations repurchase programs for an aggregate purchase price of $25.5 million. At December 31, 2007, there were no shares of common stock available for repurchase. On January 22, 2008, the Corporation publicly announced that its board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to 500,000 shares of the Corporations common stock under a stock repurchase program. During 2008, no shares were repurchased. At December 31, 2008, there were 500,000 remaining shares available for repurchase under the January 2008 authorization. In addition, during 2008, 2007 and 2006, 38,416 shares, 9,017 shares and 39,036 shares, respectively, of the Corporations common stock were delivered or attested in satisfaction of the exercise price and/or tax withholding obligations by holders of employee stock options. NOTE 14  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Effective January 1, 2008, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) and also elected not to delay the application of SFAS 157 to nonfinancial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as permitted by FSP No. SFAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157. SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities by providing a single definition for fair value, a framework for measuring fair value and expanding disclosures concerning fair value. SFAS 157 requires expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. SFAS 157 does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. The adoption of SFAS 157 did not have an impact on the Corporations consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The application of SFAS 157 in situations where the market for a financial asset is not active was clarified by the issuance of FSP No. SFAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active, (FSP 157-3) in October 2008. FSP 157-3 became effective immediately and did not significantly impact the methods by which the Corporation determined the fair values of its financial assets. SFAS 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The price in the principal (or most advantageous) market used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability is not adjusted for transaction costs. An orderly transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets and liabilities; it is not a forced transaction. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to transact and (iv) willing to transact. 61 Table of Contents The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and to determine fair value disclosures. Investment securities  available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, the Corporation may be required to record other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans, goodwill, other intangible assets, other real estate and repossessed assets. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve the application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. The Corporation determines the fair market value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in SFAS 157. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value as follows: Level 1 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Level 3 Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models or similar techniques. The determination of fair value also requires significant management judgment or estimation. A description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below. These valuation methodologies were applied to all of the Corporations financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value. In general, fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value. Any such valuation adjustments are applied consistently over time. The Corporations valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While management believes the Corporations valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Furthermore, the reported fair value amounts have not been comprehensively revalued since the presentation dates, and therefore, estimates of fair value after the balance sheet date may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Investment securities  Available-for-Sale: Investment securities  Available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques that include market inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data and industry and economic events. Level 1 valuations include U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets. Level 2 valuations include government sponsored agencies, securities issued by state and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and corporate bonds. For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, SFAS 157 requires quantitative disclosures about the fair value measurements separately for each major category of assets as reported below: Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2008 Quoted Prices In Active Significant Markets for Other Significant Identical Observable Unobservable Assets Inputs Inputs Description (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total (In thousands) Investment securities  Available-for-sale $ 21,494 $ 428,453 $  $ 449,947 There were no liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008. 62 Table of Contents Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Impaired Loans: The Corporation does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, from time to time, a loan is considered impaired and a specific allocation of the allowance for loan losses (valuation allowance) is established. Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. Once a loan is identified as individually impaired, management measures impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan (SFAS 114). The fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods, including the loans observable market price, the fair value of the collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate. Those impaired loans not requiring a valuation allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. At December 31, 2008, substantially all of the impaired loans were evaluated based on the fair value of the collateral. In accordance with SFAS 157, impaired loans, where a valuation allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral, require classification in the fair value hierarchy. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, the Corporation records the impaired loan at a nonrecurring Level 2 valuation. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value or there is no observable market price, the Corporation records the impaired loan at a nonrecurring Level 3 valuation. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation recorded $45.5 million of its $59.0 million of impaired loans at fair value through a valuation allowance at December 31, 2008 or loan charge-off recorded in current or prior periods. Goodwill: Goodwill is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis. The market and income approach methods were used in the completion of impairment testing at December 31, 2008. These valuation methods require a significant degree of management judgment. In the event these methods indicate that fair value is less than the carrying value, the asset is recorded at fair value as determined by either of the valuation models. As such, the Corporation classifies goodwill subjected to nonrecurring fair value measurements as Level 3 valuations. At December 31, 2008, no goodwill impairment was recorded. Other Intangible Assets: Other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible assets and mortgage servicing rights. These items are both carried at fair value when initially recorded. Subsequently, core deposit intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line or accelerated basis over periods ranging from three to fifteen years and are subject to impairment testing whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If core deposit intangible asset impairment is identified and recorded, the Corporation classifies impaired core deposit intangible assets subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements as Level 3 valuations. At December 31, 2008, there was no impairment recorded for core deposit intangible assets. The fair value of MSRs is initially estimated using a model that calculates the net present value of estimated future cash flows using various assumptions including prepayment speeds, the discount rate and servicing costs. If the valuation model reflects a value less than the carrying value, MSRs are adjusted to fair value, determined by the model, through a valuation allowance. The Corporation classifies MSRs subjected to nonrecurring fair value measurements as Level 3 valuations. At December 31, 2008, there was no impairment recorded for MSRs. Other Real Estate and Repossessed Assets: The carrying amounts for ORE and repossessed assets (RA) are reported in the consolidated statements of financial position under Interest receivable and other assets. ORE and RA include real estate and other types of assets foreclosed upon or repossessed by the Corporation. ORE and RA are adjusted to the lower of cost or fair value upon the transfer of a loan to ORE or RA. Fair value is generally based on independent appraisal values of the collateral. Subsequently, ORE and RA are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or managements estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, the Corporation records ORE and RA subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements as Level 2 valuations. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the Corporation records the ORE and RA subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements as nonrecurring Level 3 valuations. 63 Table of Contents The Corporation is required to measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These include assets that are measured at the lower of cost or market that were recognized at fair value below cost at December 31, 2008. The following summarizes each major category of assets that was measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis: Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2008 Quoted Prices In Active Significant Markets for Other Significant Identical Observable Unobservable Assets Inputs Inputs Description (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total (In thousands) Loans $  $  $ 45,522 $ 45,522 Other real estate/repossessed assets   19,265 19,265 Total $  $  $ 64,787 $ 64,787 There were no liabilities recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2008. SFAS No. 107, Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments (SFAS 107) requires disclosures about the estimated fair values of the Corporations financial instruments, including those financial assets and liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. The Corporation utilized the fair value hierarchy required under SFAS 157 in computing the fair values of its financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices were not available, the Corporation employed present value methods using unobservable inputs requiring managements judgment to estimate the fair values of its financial instruments, which are considered Level 3 valuations under SFAS 157. These Level 3 valuations are significantly affected by the assumptions made and, accordingly, do not necessarily indicate amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange. It is also the Corporations general practice and intent to hold the majority of its financial instruments until maturity and, therefore, the Corporation does not expect to realize the estimated amounts disclosed. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities on a recurring or nonrecurring basis are discussed above. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the estimated fair values of cash and cash equivalents, interest receivable and interest payable approximated their carrying values at those dates. The methodologies for other financial assets and financial liabilities are discussed below: Investment securities  Held-to-Maturity: Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques that include market inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data and industry and economic events. Fair value measurements using Level 2 valuations of investment securities-held-to-maturity include government sponsored agencies, certain securities issued by state and political subdivisions and mortgage-backed securities. Level 3 valuations include certain securities issued by state and political subdivisions and trust preferred securities. Other securities: Fair value measurements of other securities, which consisted of FHLB and FRB stock, is based on its redeemable value, which is cost. The market for these stocks is restricted to the issuer of the stock and subject to impairment evaluation. Loans Held-For-Sale: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated statements of financial position for loans held-for-sale are at the lower of cost or market value. The fair values of loans held-for-sale are based on the market price for similar loans in the secondary market. The fair value measurements for loans held-for-sale are Level 2 valuations. Loans: For variable interest rate loans that reprice regularly with changes in market interest rates and have no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values. The fair values for all other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The resulting amounts are adjusted to estimate the effect of declines in the credit quality of borrowers after the loans were originated. The fair value measurements for fixed interest rate loans are Level 3 valuations. 64 Table of Contents Deposit liabilities: The fair values of deposit accounts without defined maturities, such as interest- and noninterest-bearing checking, savings and money market accounts, are equal to the amounts payable on demand. Fair value measurements for interest-bearing deposits (time deposits) with defined maturities are based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows, using interest rates currently being offered for deposits of similar maturities and are Level 3 valuations. The fair values for variable-interest rate certificates of deposit approximate their carrying amounts. Short-term borrowings: Short-term borrowings consist of repurchase agreements and FHLB advances  short-term. Fair value measurements are estimated for repurchase agreements and FHLB advances  short-term based on the present value of future estimated cash flows using current rates offered to the Corporation for debt with similar terms and are Level 2 valuations. FHLB advances  long-term: Fair value measurement is estimated based on the present value of future estimated cash flows using current rates offered to the Corporation for debt with similar terms and are Level 2 valuations. Unused commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and undisbursed loans: The Corporations unused loan commitments, standby letters of credit and undisbursed loans have no carrying amount and have been estimated to have no realizable fair value. Historically, a majority of the unused loan commitments have not been drawn upon and, generally, the Corporation does not receive fees in connection with these commitments. Fair value measurements have not been made for items that are not defined by SFAS 107 as financial instruments, including such items as the Corporations core deposits and the value of its trust and investment management services department. The Corporation believes it is impractical to estimate a representative fair value for these types of assets, even though management believes they add significant value to the Corporation. The following is a summary of carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instrument components of the consolidated statements of financial position at December 31: 2008 2007 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Amount Value Amount Value (In thousands) Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 173,222 $ 173,222 $ 189,513 $ 189,513 Investment and other securities 569,586 562,631 616,649 617,063 Loans held for sale 8,463 8,463 7,883 7,883 Loans, net of allowance for loan losses 2,924,621 2,920,285 2,760,012 2,732,531 Interest receivable 15,680 15,680 16,872 16,872 Liabilities: Deposits without defined maturities $ 1,908,860 $ 1,908,860 $ 1,797,306 $ 1,797,306 Time deposits 1,069,932 1,079,498 1,078,283 1,077,488 Interest payable 3,048 3,048 4,594 4,594 Short-term borrowings 233,738 233,743 197,363 197,363 FHLB advances  long-term 135,025 138,729 150,049 152,533 Effective January 1, 2008, the Corporation adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits the Corporation to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value measurement option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value option (i) may be applied instrument by instrument, with certain exceptions, thus the Corporation may record identical financial assets and liabilities at fair value or by another measurement basis permitted under GAAP, (ii) is irrevocable (unless a new election date occurs) and (iii) is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments. The adoption of SFAS 159 did not have an impact on the Corporations financial statements as the Corporation did not elect the fair value option on any financial assets or liabilities during 2008. 65 Table of Contents Investment securities  Held-to-Maturity Disclosed at Level 3 Valuations At December 31, 2008, the Corporations state and political subdivision investment securities in the held-to-maturity portfolio were recorded at cost adjusted by amortization of premium or accretion of discount (book value). The total book value of these investment securities was $85.5 million at December 31, 2008. Fair values of these investment securities were calculated using a combination of Level 2 and Level 3 inputs for disclosure purposes. State and political subdivision investment securities with a book value of $32.7 million at December 31, 2008 were measured at fair value using Level 2 valuation techniques, as provided by the Corporations third-party pricing service. The fair value of these investment securities was determined to be $33.1 million at December 31, 2008. The fair value of the remaining state and political subdivision investment securities with a book value at December 31, 2008 of $52.8 million was determined using Level 3 valuation techniques, as there is no market available to price these investment securities. The method used for measuring the fair value for these investment securities included a comparison to the fair value of other investment securities valued with Level 2 inputs with similar characteristics (credit, time to maturity, call structure etc.) and the interest yield curve for comparable debt investment securities from Bloomberg. The fair value measurement of these investment securities was $52.1 million at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation held $10.5 million of trust preferred investment securities that were recorded as held-to-maturity. Of the $10.5 million balance, $10 million represented a 100% interest in a trust preferred investment security of a small non-public bank holding company purchased in the second quarter of 2008. The Corporation purchased the entire issue of this investment security, in a negotiated transaction with the issuer, and therefore, there is not an active trading market for this investment security. As clarified by FSP 157-3, in a market that is not active, the use of a reporting entitys own assumptions about future cash flows and appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates is acceptable when relevant observable inputs are not available. The guidance provides that observable inputs (which are considered a Level 2 valuation) may require significant adjustment based on unobservable data and result in a Level 3 valuation. At December 31, 2008, it was the Corporations opinion that the market for trust preferred securities was not active, and thus the fair value measurement of this investment security was a Level 3 valuation developed in accordance with FSP 157-3. The fair value of the trust preferred investment security was based upon a calculation of discounted cash flows. The cash flows were discounted based upon both observable inputs and appropriate risk adjustments that market participants would make for nonperformance, illiquidity and issuer specifics. An independent third party provided the Corporation with observable inputs based on the existing market and insight into appropriate rate of return adjustments that market participants would require for the additional risk associated with a single issue investment security of this nature. Using a model that incorporated the average current yield of publicly traded performing trust preferred securities of large financial institutions with no known material financial difficulties at December 31, 2008, and adjusted for both illiquidity and the specific issuer, such as size, leverage position and location, an implied yield of 17.50% was calculated. Based upon this implied yield, the fair value measurement of the trust preferred investment security was calculated by the Corporation at $3.65 million, or 36.5% of the investments original cost, resulting in impairment of $6.35 million. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation concluded that the $6.35 million of impairment was temporary in nature. See Note 4, Investment Securities, to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the Corporations investment securities portfolio.

Effective June 30, 2006, benefits under the Pension Plan were frozen for approximately two-thirds of the Corporations salaried employees as of that date. Pension benefits continued unchanged for the remaining salaried employees. Normal retirement benefits under the Pension Plan are based on years of vested service and the employees average annual pay for the five highest consecutive years during the ten years preceding retirement, except for employees whose benefits were frozen. Benefits, for employees with less than fifteen years of service or whose age plus years of service were less than sixty-five at June 30, 2006, will be based on years of vested service at June 30, 2006 and generally the average of the employees salary for the five years ended June 30, 2006. Pension Plan contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service-to-date, but also for those expected to be earned in the future, for employees whose benefits were not frozen at June 30, 2006. As a result of the Pension Plan being partially frozen, the Corporation recognized a curtailment gain of $0.11 million in 2006. Employees hired after June 30, 2006 and employees affected by the partial freeze of the Pension Plan began receiving four percent of their eligible pay as a contribution to their 401(k) Savings Plan accounts on July 1, 2006. The assets of the Pension Plan are invested by the trust and investment management services department of the Corporations bank subsidiary, Chemical Bank. The investment policy and allocation of the assets of the pension trust were approved by the Compensation and Pension Committee of the board of directors of the Corporation. The assets of the Pension Plan are invested in a diversified portfolio of U.S. Government Treasury notes, U.S. Government agency notes, high quality corporate bonds and equity securities (primarily blue chip stocks) and equity-based mutual funds. International stocks and international equity-based mutual funds are also allowable investments of the Pension Plan. The notes and the bonds purchased are rated A or better by the major bond rating companies and mature within five years from the date of purchase. The stocks are diversified among the major economic sectors of the market and are selected based on balance sheet strength, expected earnings growth, the management team and position within their industries, among other characteristics. 67 Table of Contents The Pension Plans asset allocation by asset category was as follows: December 31, Asset Category 2008 2007 Equity securities 61 % 62 % Debt securities 37 32 Other 2 6 Total 100 % 100 % As of December 31, 2008, based upon current market conditions, the Corporations strategy was to maintain equity securities between 60% and 70% of Pension Plan assets and the Other category was expected to be maintained at less than 10% of Pension Plan assets. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, equity securities included 127,043 shares and 211,395 shares, respectively, of the Corporations common stock. During 2008 and 2007, $0.20 million and $0.24 million, respectively, in cash dividends were paid on the Corporations common stock held by the Pension Plan. The fair value of the Corporations common stock held in the Pension Plan was $3.5 million at December 31, 2008 and $5.0 million at December 31, 2007, and represented 5.9% and 6.4% of Pension Plan assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The following schedule sets forth the changes in the projected benefit obligation and plan assets of the Corporations Pension Plan: 2008 2007 (In thousands) Projected benefit obligation: Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 72,512 $ 75,580 Service cost 1,589 1,863 Interest cost 4,607 4,448 Net actuarial gain (1,212 ) (5,309 ) Benefits paid (3,150 ) (4,376 ) Early retirement benefits  306 Benefit obligation at end of year 74,346 72,512 Fair value of plan assets: Beginning fair value 78,045 79,873 Actual return on plan assets (14,372 ) 2,548 Benefits paid (3,150 ) (4,376 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of year 60,523 78,045 Funded (unfunded) status of the plan (13,823 ) 5,533 Unrecognized net actuarial loss 25,144 6,345 Unrecognized prior service credit (16 ) (21 ) Prepaid benefit cost before adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss 11,305 11,857 Additional liability under SFAS 158 (25,128 ) (6,324 ) Prepaid (accrued) benefit cost  Pension Plan $ (13,823 ) $ 5,533 The Corporations accumulated benefit obligation as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 for the Pension Plan was $67.4 million and $64.7 million, respectively. During 2008 and 2007, the Corporation did not make any contributions to the Pension Plan. The 2009 minimum required Pension Plan contribution, as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, was estimated at zero. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation had not determined whether it would make a contribution to the Pension Plan in 2009. Weighted-average rate assumptions of the Pension Plan follow: 2008 2007 2006 Discount rate used in determining benefit obligations  December 31 6.50 % 6.50 % 6.00 % Discount rate used in determining pension expense(1) 6.50 6.00 6.00 Expected long-term return on Pension Plan assets 7.00 7.00 7.00 Rate of compensation increase 4.25 4.25 4.25 (1) The Pension Plan discount rate was 5.60% from January 1 through May 31, 2006. The discount rate was changed to 6.25% effective June 1, 2006 in conjunction with the partial freeze of the Pension Plan, resulting in an average discount rate of 6.00% in 2006. 68 Table of Contents Net periodic pension cost of the Pension Plan consisted of the following for the years ended December 31: 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Service cost $ 1,589 $ 1,863 $ 3,177 Interest cost 4,607 4,448 4,452 Expected return on plan assets (5,639 ) (5,621 ) (5,853 ) Amortization of prior service credit (5 ) (5 ) (13 ) Amortization of unrecognized net loss   282 Curtailment gain   (108 ) Early retirement benefits  306  Pension Plan expense $ 552 $ 991 $ 1,937 The following schedule presents estimated future Pension Plan benefit payments (in thousands): 2009 $ 3,446 2010 3,667 2011 4,131 2012 4,527 2013 4,484 2014 - 2018 27,074 Total $ 47,329 Supplemental Plan: The Corporation also maintains a supplemental defined benefit pension plan, the Chemical Financial Corporation Supplemental Pension Plan (Supplemental Plan). The Internal Revenue Code limits both the amount of eligible compensation for benefit calculation purposes and the amount of annual benefits that may be paid from a tax-qualified retirement plan. As permitted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Corporation established the Supplemental Plan that provides payments to certain executive officers of the Corporation, as determined by the Compensation and Pension Committee, the benefits to which they would have been entitled, calculated under the provisions of the Pension Plan, as if the limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code did not apply. The following schedule sets forth the changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets of the Supplemental Plan: 2008 2007 (In thousands) Projected benefit obligation: Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 620 $ 632 Service cost 15 15 Interest cost 39 37 Net actuarial (gain) loss 140 (23 ) Benefits paid (41 ) (41 ) Benefit obligation at end of year 773 620 Fair value of plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year   Employer contributions 41 41 Benefits paid (41 ) (41 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of year   Unfunded status of the plan 773 620 Unrecognized net actuarial gain (loss) (44 ) 101 Accrued benefit cost before adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss 729 721 Addition (reduction) of liability under SFAS 158 44 (101 ) Liability for Supplemental Plan benefits $ 773 $ 620 The Supplemental Plans accumulated benefit obligation as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $0.61 million and $0.54 million, respectively. 69 Table of Contents Weighted-average rate assumptions of the Supplemental Plan follow: 2008 2007 2006 Discount rate used in determining benefit obligations  December 31 6.50 % 6.50 % 6.00 % Discount rate used in determining pension expense 6.50 6.00 5.60 Rate of compensation increase 4.25 4.25 4.25 Net periodic pension cost of the Supplemental Plan consisted of the following for the years ended December 31: 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Service cost $ 16 $ 16 $ 21 Interest cost 39 37 43 Amortization of unrecognized net (gain) loss (5 ) (2 ) 2 Supplemental Plan expense $ 50 $ 51 $ 66 The following schedule presents estimated future Supplemental Plan benefit payments (in thousands): 2009 $ 41 2010 41 2011 41 2012 42 2013 42 2014 - 2018 383 Total $ 590 Postretirement Plan: The Corporation has a postretirement benefit plan that provides medical benefits, and dental benefits through age 65, to a small portion of its active employees, to employees who retired through December 31, 2001 and others who were provided eligibility via acquisitions. Through December 31, 2001, eligibility for such benefits was age 55 with at least ten years of service with the Corporation. Effective January 1, 2002, the Corporation adopted a revised retiree medical program (Postretirement Plan), which substantially reduced the future obligation of the Corporation for retiree medical and dental costs. Retirees and certain employees that met age and service requirements as of December 31, 2001 were grandfathered under the Postretirement Plan. As of January 1, 2008, the Postretirement Plan included 17 active employees in the grandfathered group that were eligible to receive a premium supplement and 90 retirees receiving a premium supplement. The majority of the retirees are required to make contributions toward the cost of their benefits based on their years of credited service and age at retirement. All 17 active employees are currently eligible to receive benefits and will be required to make contributions toward the cost of their benefits upon retirement. Retiree contributions are generally adjusted annually. The accounting for these postretirement benefits anticipates changes in future cost-sharing features such as retiree contributions, deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, modify or terminate these benefits at any time. Employees who retire at age 55 or older and have at least ten years of service with the Corporation are provided access to the Corporations group health insurance coverage for the employee and a spouse, with no employer subsidy, and are not considered participants in the Postretirement Plan. 70 Table of Contents The following sets forth changes in the Corporations Postretirement Plan benefit obligation: 2008 2007 (In thousands) Projected postretirement benefit obligation: Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 4,289 $ 4,779 Interest cost 260 261 Net actuarial gain (117 ) (503 ) Benefits paid, net of retiree contributions (248 ) (248 ) Benefit obligation at end of year 4,184 4,289 Fair value of plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year   Employer contributions, net of retiree contributions 248 248 Benefits paid, net of retiree contributions (248 ) (248 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of year   Unfunded status of the plan 4,184 4,289 Unrecognized net actuarial loss (439 ) (563 ) Unrecognized prior service credit 1,273 1,597 Accrued postretirement benefit cost before adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss 5,018 5,323 Reduction of liability under SFAS 158 (834 ) (1,034 ) Liability for Postretirement Plan benefits $ 4,184 $ 4,289 The Postretirement Plans accumulated benefit obligation as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $4.2 million and $4.3 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit (income) cost of the Postretirement Plan consisted of the following for the years ended December 31: 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Interest cost $ 260 $ 261 $ 271 Amortization of prior service credit (324 ) (324 ) (325 ) Amortization of unrecognized net loss 7 28 56 Postretirement Plan (income) expense $ (57 ) $ (35 ) $ 2 The following presents estimated future retiree plan benefit payments under the Postretirement Plan (in thousands): 2009 $ 342 2010 353 2011 363 2012 367 2013 366 2014 - 2018 1,727 Total $ 3,518 Weighted-average rate assumptions of the Postretirement Plan follow: 2008 2007 2006 Discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation  December 31 6.50 % 6.50 % 6.00 % Discount rate used in determining periodic postretirement benefit cost 6.50 6.00 5.60 Year 1 increase in cost of postretirement benefits 9.00 9.00 9.00 For measurement purposes, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits and dental benefits for 2009 were each assumed at 9.0%. These rates were assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% in 2013 and remain at that level thereafter. 71 Table of Contents The assumed health care and dental cost trend rates could have a significant effect on the amounts reported. A one percentage-point change in these rates would have the following effects: One Percentage- One Percentage- Point Increase Point Decrease (In thousands) Effect on total of service and interest cost components in 2008 $ 24 $ (21 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2008 386 (340 ) The measurement date used to determine the Pension Plan, Supplemental Plan and Postretirement Plan benefit amounts disclosed herein was December 31 of each year. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss: The following sets forth the changes in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax, related to the Corporations pension, supplemental and postretirement benefit plans during 2008: Pension Supplemental Postretirement Plan Plan Plan Total (In thousands) Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income at beginning of year $ (4,110 ) $ 65 $ 672 $ (3,373 ) Prior service credits (3 ) (3 ) (211 ) (217 ) Net (loss) gain (12,220 ) (92 ) 81 (12,231 ) Comprehensive income (loss) adjustment for pension, supplemental and other postretirement benefits (12,223 ) (95 ) (130 ) (12,448 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at end of year $ (16,333 ) $ (30 ) $ 542 $ (15,821 ) The estimated (costs) and income that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic cost over the next fiscal year are as follows: Pension Supplemental Postretirement Plan Plan Plan Total (In thousands) Prior service credits $ (3 ) $  $ (211 ) $ (214 ) Net actuarial gain   7 7 Total $ (3 ) $  $ (204 ) $ (207 ) 401(k) Savings Plan: The Corporations 401(k) Savings Plan provides an employer match, in addition to a 4% contribution, for employees who are not grandfathered under the Pension Plan discussed above. The 401(k) Savings Plan is available to all regular employees and provides employees with tax deferred salary deductions and alternative investment options. The Corporation matches 50% of the participants elective deferrals on the first 4% of the participants base compensation. The 401(k) Savings Plan provides employees with the option to invest in the Corporations common stock. The Corporations match under the 401(k) Savings Plan was $0.66 million in 2008, $0.67 million in 2007 and $0.61 million in 2006. Employer contributions to the 401(k) Savings Plan for the 4% benefit for employees who are not grandfathered under the Pension Plan, totaled $1.25 million in 2008, $1.21 million in 2007 and $0.57 million in 2006. The combined amount of the employer match and 4% contribution to the 401(k) Savings Plan totaled $1.91 million in 2008, $1.88 million in 2007 and $1.18 million in 2006. NOTE 18  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Share-Based Compensation: The Corporation maintains share-based employee compensation plans, under which it periodically has granted stock options for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant, stock awards for a fixed number of shares and restricted stock units. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Corporation accounted for stock options under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to 72 Table of Contents Employees (Opinion 25), and related interpretations, as permitted by SFAS 123. No share-based employee compensation expense was recognized in the consolidated statements of income for years ended prior to December 31, 2006, as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2006, the Corporation adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified-prospective transition method. In accordance with SFAS 123(R), the fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period. The requisite service period is the shorter of the vesting period or the period to retirement eligibility. The impact of the adoption of SFAS 123(R) was decreased as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of options to purchase 167,527 shares of the Corporations common stock in December 2005. The acceleration of the vesting of these options reduced non-cash compensation expense in 2008, 2007 and 2006 by approximately $0.2 million, $0.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively. As a result of adopting SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006, the Corporation recognized compensation expense related to share-based awards (stock options) in 2008 and 2007 of $0.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively. During 2008, the Corporation granted options to purchase 63,593 shares of stock and 30,701 restricted stock performance units to certain officers of the Company. During 2007, the Corporation granted options to purchase 182,223 shares of stock to certain officers of the Company. The stock options granted in 2008 and 2007 have an exercise price equal to the market value of the common stock on the date of grant, vest ratably over a three- or five-year period and expire 10 years from the date of the grant. Compensation expense related to stock option awards was $0.7 million and $0.2 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The restricted stock performance units vest at December 31, 2010 if any of the predetermined targeted earnings per share levels are achieved in 2010. The restricted stock performance units vest from 0.5x to 2x the number of units originally granted depending on which, if any, of the predetermined targeted earnings per share levels are met in 2010. Upon vesting, the restricted stock performance units will be converted to shares of the Corporations stock on a one-to-one basis. However, if the minimum earnings per share performance level is not achieved in 2010, no shares will be issued. Compensation expense related to restricted stock performance units is recognized over the requisite performance period. The fair values of stock options granted during 2008 were $6.25 per share for 54,593 options, $6.29 per share for 5,000 options, $6.26 per share for 2,500 options and $5.30 per share for 1,500 options. The fair values of stock options granted during 2007 were $7.28 per share for 174,305 options, $7.01 per share for 5,000 options, $7.35 per share for 2,418 options and $6.93 per share for 500 options. The Corporation did not grant share-based compensation awards during 2006. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions. 2008 2007 Expected dividend yield 4.20 % 3.50% Risk-free interest rate 3.28%-3.43 % 4.25%-5.04% Expected stock volatility 36.40 % 34.40% Forfeiture rate 16.00 % 15.00% Expected life of options  in years 6.38 6.87 Expected stock volatility is based on historical volatility of the Corporations stock over a seven-year period for the options granted in 2008 and 2007. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the contractual life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected life of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based primarily upon historical experience, considering both option exercise behavior and employee terminations. The forfeiture rate represents the percentage of options that are expected to be cancelled, based on historical experience. Because of the unpredictability of the assumptions required, the Black-Scholes model, or any other valuation model, is incapable of accurately predicting the Corporations stock price or of placing an accurate present value on options to purchase its stock. In addition, the Black-Scholes model was designed to approximate value for types of options that are very different from those issued by the Corporation. In spite of any theoretical value that may be placed on a stock option grant, no value is possible under options issued by the Corporation without an increase in the market value of the Corporations stock. During 2006, the board of directors approved stock awards totaling 1,363 shares that were issued in 2007. The awards had a value of $32.88 per share based on the closing price of the Corporations stock on the date the board of directors approved the awards. Stock Option Plans: The Corporations Stock Incentive Plan of 1997 (1997 Plan), which was shareholder-approved, permits awards of options to purchase shares of common stock to its employees. As of December 31, 2006, there were no options to purchase shares available for future grants under the 1997 Plan, by action of the board of directors in December 2006. 73 Table of Contents The Corporations Stock Incentive Plan of 2006 (2006 Plan), which was shareholder-approved, permits awards of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock awards, other stock-based and stock-related awards and stock appreciation rights (incentive awards). Subject to certain anti-dilution and other adjustments, 1,000,000 shares of the Corporations common stock were originally available for incentive awards under the 2006 Plan. At December 31, 2008, there were 722,120 shares available for future issuance under the 2006 Plan. Key employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, as the Compensation and Pension Committee of the board of directors may select from time to time, are eligible to receive awards under the 2006 Plan. No employee of the Corporation may receive any awards under the 2006 Plan while the employee is a member of the Compensation and Pension Committee. The 2006 Plan provides for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control of the Corporation as defined in the 2006 Plan. Option awards can be granted with an exercise price equal to no less than the market price of the Corporations stock at the date of grant and the Corporation expects option awards generally to vest from one to five years from the date of grant. Dividends are not paid on unexercised options. A summary of stock option activity during the three years ended December 31, 2008 is presented below: Weighted Weighted Average Average Remaining Aggregate Number of Exercise Price Contractual Term Intrinsic Value Options Per Share (In years) (In thousands) Outstanding  January 1, 2006 745,428 $ 31.63 Activity during 2006: Granted   Exercised (97,896 ) 21.75 Cancelled (6,038 ) 30.92 Outstanding  December 31, 2006 641,494 33.15 Activity during 2007: Granted 182,223 24.76 Exercised (10,920 ) 26.33 Cancelled (19,016 ) 26.38 Outstanding  December 31, 2007 793,781 31.26 Activity during 2008: Granted 63,593 24.46 Exercised (95,764 ) 27.28 Cancelled (60,064 ) 31.69 Outstanding  December 31, 2008 701,546 $ 31.15 6.75 $ 870 Exercisable/vested at December 31, 2008 522,711 $ 33.38 6.05 $ 293 At December 31, 2008, there were no outstanding stock options with stock appreciation rights. The aggregate intrinsic values of outstanding and exercisable options at December 31, 2008 were calculated based on the closing price of the Corporations stock on December 31, 2008 of $27.88 per share less the exercise price of these options. Outstanding and exercisable options with intrinsic values less than zero, or out-of-the-money options, were not included in the aggregate intrinsic value reported. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $0.43 million, $0.04 million and $0.64 million, respectively. At December 31, 2008, unrecognized compensation expense for nonvested stock options outstanding totaled $0.8 million and the weighted-average period over which this amount will be recognized is 1.7 years. Compensation expense of $0.5 million and $0.3 million will be recognized for stock options that vest in 2009 and 2010, respectively. 74 Table of Contents The following summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2008: Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Weighted Weighted Average Range of Average Exercise Exercise Exercise Number Price Average Prices Number Price Outstanding Per Share Term* Per Share Exercisable Per Share 1,500 $ 20.78 9.54 $ 20.78  $  19,259 23.59 2.66 23.14 - 23.63 19,259 23.59 241,746 24.71 8.71 24.07 - 24.86 64,411 24.76 50,513 27.51 3.42 26.17 - 27.78 50,513 27.51 149,600 32.28 6.97 32.28 149,600 32.28 75,653 35.67 4.95 35.67 75,653 35.67 163,275 39.69 5.95 39.69 163,275 39.69 701,546 $ 31.15 6.75 $ 20.78 - 39.69 522,711 $ 33.38 * Weighted average remaining contractual term in years NOTE 19  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES The provision for federal income taxes is less than that computed by applying the federal statutory income tax rate of 35%, primarily due to tax-exempt interest income on investment securities and loans during 2008, 2007 and 2006, and also due to the reversal of federal income tax reserves upon the reassessment of required tax accruals in 2006. The differences between the provision for federal income taxes, computed at the federal statutory income tax rate, and the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements are as follows for the years ended December 31: 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Tax at statutory rate $ 9,850 $ 20,022 $ 24,258 Changes resulting from: Tax-exempt interest income (1,409 ) (1,377 ) (1,295 ) Other, net (141 ) (448 ) (498 ) Provision for federal income taxes $ 8,300 $ 18,197 $ 22,465 The effective federal income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 29.5%, 31.8% and 32.4%, respectively. The provision for federal income taxes consisted of the following for the years ended December 31: 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Current $ 15,182 $ 21,178 $ 22,882 Deferred (6,882 ) (2,981 ) (417 ) Total $ 8,300 $ 18,197 $ 22,465 75 Table of Contents Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant temporary differences that comprise the deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Corporation were as follows: December 31, 2008 2007 (In thousands) Deferred tax assets: Allowance for loan losses $ 19,916 $ 13,722 Accrued expenses 1,265 1,376 Employee benefit plans 6,590  Nonaccrual loan interest 1,763 1,059 Core deposit intangible assets 1,104 966 Other real estate 624 345 Other 2,186 1,804 Total deferred tax assets 33,448 19,272 Deferred tax liabilities: Fixed assets 1,078 474 Mortgage servicing rights 767 799 Goodwill 2,702 2,336 Investment securities available-for-sale 1,610 848 Prepaid expenses 501 598 Other 1,306 1,488 Total deferred tax liabilities 7,964 6,543 Net deferred tax assets $ 25,484 $ 12,729 Federal income tax expense (benefit) applicable to net gains (losses) on investment securities transactions was $0.5 million in 2008 and $(0.5) million in 2006, and is included in the provision for federal income taxes on the consolidated statements of income. The tax periods open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service include the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The same fiscal years are open to examination for the Michigan Business Tax/Michigan Single Business Tax with the addition of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. The Corporation adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. Upon adoption of FIN 48, the Corporation recognized an increase in retained earnings of $0.04 million, a reduction in goodwill of $0.22 million and a reduction in income taxes payable (included in interest payable and other liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position) of $0.26 million. After adoption of FIN 48, the Corporation had no remaining income tax reserves and had none at December 31, 2008 and 2007. NOTE 20  COMMITMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the loan contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Historically, the majority of the commitments of the Corporations subsidiary bank have not been drawn upon and, therefore, may not represent future cash requirements. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued generally by the Corporations subsidiary bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Both arrangements have credit risk essentially the same as that involved in making loans to customers and are subject to the Corporations normal credit policies. Collateral obtained upon exercise of commitments is determined using managements credit evaluation of the borrowers and may include real estate, business assets, deposits and other items. The Corporations subsidiary bank at any point in time also has approved but undisbursed loans. The majority of these undisbursed loans will convert to booked loans within a three-month period. At December 31, 2008, total unused loan commitments, standby letters of credit and undisbursed loans were $405 million, $38 million and $152 million, respectively. At December 31, 2007, total unused loan commitments, standby letters of credit and undisbursed loans were $405 million, $28 million and $102 million, respectively. Mortgage loan commitments to customers, which are included in undisbursed loans, totaled $66.2 million at December 31, 2008 and $6.9 million at December 31, 2007. A significant portion of the unused loan commitments and standby letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2008 expire one year from their contract date; however, $31 million of unused loan commitments extend for more than five years. The Corporations unused loan commitments and standby letters of credit have been estimated to have no realizable fair value, as historically the majority of the unused loan commitments have not been drawn upon and generally the Corporations subsidiary bank does not receive fees in connection with these agreements. 76 Table of Contents The Corporation has operating leases and other non-cancelable contractual obligations on buildings, equipment, computer software and other expenses that will require annual payments through 2015, including renewal option periods for those building leases that the Corporation expects to renew. Minimum payments due in each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows (in thousands): 2009 $ 6,803 2010 5,965 2011 3,407 2012 1,844 2013 290 2014 and thereafter 92 Total $ 18,401 Minimum payments include estimates, where applicable, of estimated usage and annual Consumer Price Index increases of approximately 3%. Total expense recorded under operating leases and other non-cancelable contractual obligations was $6.9 million in 2008, $4.3 million in 2007 and $3.6 million in 2006. The Corporation and its bank subsidiary are subject to certain legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after consulting with legal counsel, the ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated net income or financial position of the Corporation. NOTE 21  REGULATORY CAPITAL AND RESERVE REQUIREMENTS Banking regulations require that banks maintain cash reserve balances in vault cash, with the Federal Reserve Bank, or with certain other qualifying banks. The aggregate average amount of such legal balances required to be maintained by the Corporations subsidiary bank was $25.5 million during 2008 and $34.9 million during 2007. During 2008, the Corporations subsidiary bank satisfied its legal reserve requirements by maintaining vault cash balances in excess of legal reserve requirements. The Corporations subsidiary bank was not required to maintain compensating balances with correspondent banks during 2008 or 2007. Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on the transfer of assets in the form of dividends, loans or advances from the subsidiary bank to the Corporation. At December 31, 2008, substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary bank were restricted from transfer to the Corporation in the form of loans or advances. Dividends from its subsidiary bank are the principal source of funds for the Corporation. Dividends paid to the Corporation by its subsidiary bank totaled $59 million in 2008, $49 million in 2007 and $28 million in 2006. Dividends paid to the Corporation in 2008 by its subsidiary bank of $59 million included $30 million paid in the fourth quarter that required and received approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. At December 31, 2008, the subsidiary bank could not pay any dividends to the parent without regulatory approval due to dividends paid in 2007 and 2008 significantly exceeding the subsidiary banks net income. At December 31, 2008, the subsidiary bank was well-capitalized as defined by federal banking regulations. In addition to the statutory limits, the Corporation considers the overall financial and capital position of the subsidiary bank prior to making any cash dividend decisions. The Corporation and its subsidiary bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Under these capital requirements, the subsidiary bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. In addition, capital amounts and classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Corporations consolidated financial statements. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require minimum ratios of Tier 1 capital to average assets (Leverage Ratio), and Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets. These capital guidelines assign risk weights to on- and off- balance sheet items in arriving at total risk-weighted assets. Minimum capital levels are based upon the perceived risk of various asset categories and certain off-balance sheet instruments. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Corporations and its subsidiary banks capital ratios exceeded the quantitative capital ratios required for an institution to be considered well-capitalized. Significant factors that may affect capital adequacy include, but are not limited to, a disproportionate growth in assets versus capital and a change in mix or credit quality of assets. 77 Table of Contents The summary below compares the Corporations and its subsidiary banks actual capital amounts and ratios with the quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy: December 31, 2008 Risk-Based Capital Leverage Tier 1 Total Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio (Dollars in millions) Corporations capital $ 434 12 % $ 434 15 % $ 470 16 % Required capital  minimum 149 4 115 4 230 8 Required capital  well-capitalized definition 187 5 172 6 287 10 Chemical Banks capital 392 11 392 14 428 15 Required capital  minimum 149 4 115 4 229 8 Required capital  well-capitalized definition 186 5 172 6 286 10 December 31, 2007 Risk-Based Capital Leverage Tier 1 Total Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio (Dollars in millions) Corporations capital $ 436 12 % $ 436 16 % $ 470 17 % Required capital  minimum 147 4 109 4 217 8 Required capital  well-capitalized definition 184 5 163 6 271 10 Chemical Banks capital 426 12 426 16 459 17 Required capital  minimum 147 4 108 4 217 8 Required capital  well-capitalized definition 183 5 162 6 271 10 NOTE 22  PARENT COMPANY ONLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Condensed financial statements of Chemical Financial Corporation (parent company) only follow: December 31, Condensed Statements of Financial Position 2008 2007 (In thousands) Assets: Cash at subsidiary bank $ 36,263 $ 4,285 Investment securities available-for-sale  500 Investment in subsidiary bank 448,331 497,312 Premises and equipment 5,488 5,469 Goodwill 1,092 1,092 Other assets 1,111 359 Total assets $ 492,285 $ 509,017 Liabilities and Shareholders Equity: Other liabilities $ 741 $ 553 Total liabilities 741 553 Shareholders equity 491,544 508,464 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 492,285 $ 509,017 78 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, Condensed Statements of Income 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Income: Cash dividends from subsidiary bank $ 59,000 $ 49,000 $ 28,000 Interest income from subsidiary bank 60 393 593 Other interest income and dividends  57 137 Rental revenue   88 Other  8 9 Total income 59,060 49,458 28,827 Expenses: Operating expenses 2,324 2,019 1,720 Total expenses 2,324 2,019 1,720 Income before income taxes and equity in undistributed net income of subsidiaries 56,736 47,439 27,107 Federal income tax benefit 792 545 599 (Distributions in excess of) equity in undistributed net income of: Subsidiary bank (37,686 ) (8,975 ) 19,123 Non-bank subsidiaries   15 Net income $ 19,842 $ 39,009 $ 46,844 Years Ended December 31, Condensed Statements of Cash Flows 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Operating Activities: Net income $ 19,842 $ 39,009 $ 46,844 Share-based compensation expense 664   Depreciation of premises and equipment 481 439 328 Net amortization of investment securities   16 Distributions in excess of (equity in undistributed) net income of subsidiaries 37,686 8,975 (19,138 ) Net (increase) decrease in other assets (441 ) (39 ) 190 Net increase (decrease) in other liabilities 188 (245 ) (989 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 58,420 48,139 27,251 Investing Activities: Cash assumed (paid) in transfer of net assets (liabilities) to subsidiary bank 450 (643 ) 1,360 Purchases of premises and equipment, net (500 ) (198 ) (1,132 ) Purchases of investment securities available-for-sale   (241 ) Proceeds from maturities and calls of investment securities available-for-sale  350 100 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (50 ) (491 ) 87 Financing Activities: Cash dividends paid (28,131 ) (27,712 ) (27,403 ) Proceeds from directors stock purchase plan 231 223 255 Proceeds from employees exercises of stock options 1,508 21 916 Repurchases of shares  (25,511 ) (9,343 ) Net cash used in financing activities (26,392 ) (52,979 ) (35,575 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 31,978 (5,331 ) (8,237 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 4,285 9,616 17,853 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 36,263 $ 4,285 $ 9,616 79 Table of Contents NOTE 23  SUMMARY OF QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) The following quarterly information is unaudited.

These quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail markup, markdown, or commission, and may not necessarily represent actual transactions. 2008 2007 High Low High Low First quarter $ 28.33 $ 19.62 $ 33.85 $ 27.29 Second quarter 25.64 19.71 30.94 25.70 Third quarter 42.98 14.62 31.65 21.00 Fourth quarter 33.00 19.14 27.94 22.00 The earnings of the Corporations subsidiary bank, Chemical Bank, are the principal source of funds to pay cash dividends. Accordingly, cash dividends are dependent upon the earnings, capital needs, regulatory constraints, and other factors affecting Chemical Bank. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of such limitations. The Corporation has paid regular cash dividends every quarter since it began operation as a bank holding company in 1973. The following table summarizes the quarterly cash dividends paid to shareholders over the past five years, adjusted for stock dividends paid during this time period. Based on the financial condition of the Corporation at December 31, 2008, management expects the Corporation to pay quarterly cash dividends on its common shares in 2009; however, there can be no assurance as to future dividends because they are dependent on future earnings, capital requirements and the Corporations financial condition. On January 20, 2009, the board of directors declared a $0.295 per share first quarter 2009 cash dividend, payable on March 20, 2009.
