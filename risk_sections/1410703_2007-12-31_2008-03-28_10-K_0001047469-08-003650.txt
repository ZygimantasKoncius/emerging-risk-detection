BUSINESS Danvers Bancorp, Inc. Danvers Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company") is a Massachusetts-chartered mutual holding company or MHC. Danvers Bancorp Inc.'s principal activity is the ownership and management of its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Danversbank, a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank. The executive office of Danvers Bancorp is located at One Conant Street, Danvers, Massachusetts 01923, and its telephone number is (978) 777-2200. Danversbank Danversbank is a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank headquartered in Danvers, Massachusetts. Originally founded in 1850 as a Massachusetts-chartered mutual savings bank, we have grown through acquisitions and internal growth, including de novo branching. In 1998, we converted our charter to a stock savings bank as part of the formation of Danvers Bancorp. We conduct business from our main office located at One Conant Street, Danvers, Massachusetts, and our 14 branch offices located in Andover, Beverly, Boston, Chelsea, Danvers, Malden, Middleton, Peabody, Reading, Revere, Salem, Saugus, Wilmington, and Woburn, Massachusetts. The telephone number at our main office is (978) 777-2200. General Danversbank's deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, as well as by the Depositors Insurance Fund, or DIF. The DIF is a private, industry-sponsored insurance company that insures all deposits over the FDIC's per-depositor limits of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts and $100,000 for all other deposit accounts in 69 Massachusetts-chartered savings banks. Danversbank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, or FHLBB, and is regulated by the FDIC and the Massachusetts Division of Banks. Danversbank's business consists primarily of making loans to its customers, including commercial and industrial, or C&I loans, commercial real estate loans, owner-occupied residential mortgages and consumer loans, and investing in a variety of investment securities. Danversbank funds these lending and investment activities with deposits from the general public, funds generated from operations and selected borrowings. Danversbank also provides non-deposit investment products and services, cash management, debit and credit card products and online banking services. Danversbank has four subsidiaries: Conant Ventures, Inc.; Conant Investment Corporation; Danvers Square Investment Corporation; and One Conant Capital LLC. Stock Conversion On June 15, 2007, the Board of Trustees of the Company adopted a Plan of Conversion (the "Plan") whereby the Company would convert to a Delaware-chartered stock corporation and offer Company stock on a priority basis to qualifying depositors, tax-qualified employee plans, and employees, officers and directors of Danversbank and the Company, with any remaining shares to be offered to the public in a direct community offering and possibly in a syndicated community offering (the "Conversion"). The Conversion closed on January 9, 2008. The Company issued 17,192,500 shares of common stock to subscribers (including tax-qualified employee benefit plans) at the offering price of $10.00 per share. The Company also contributed $350,000 in cash and 650,000 shares of common stock to the Danversbank Foundation (the "Foundation"). 4 The offering was oversubscribed by qualifying depositors of Danversbank, i.e., depositors having eligible accounts as of February 28, 2006. Accordingly, qualifying depositors had valid orders filled in accordance with the allocation procedures and there were no remaining shares to be offered in a community offering. As part of the Conversion, the Company established a liquidation account in an amount equal to the net worth of Danversbank as of the date of the latest consolidated balance sheet appearing in the final prospectus distributed in connection with the Conversion. The liquidation account is maintained for the benefit of eligible account holders and supplemental eligible account holders who maintain their accounts at Danversbank after the Conversion. The liquidation account will be reduced annually to the extent that such account holders have reduced their qualifying deposits as of each anniversary date. Subsequent increases will not restore an account holder's interest in the liquidation account. In the event of a complete liquidation, each eligible account holder will be entitled to receive balances for accounts then held. Subsequent to the Conversion, the Company may not declare or pay dividends on, and may not repurchase, any of its shares of common stock if the effect thereof would cause stockholders' equity to be reduced below applicable regulatory capital maintenance requirements or if such declaration, payment or repurchase would otherwise violate regulatory requirements. Conversion costs have been deferred and have reduced the proceeds from the shares sold in the Conversion. As of December 31, 2007, Conversion costs amounting to $1,371,000 have been incurred and are included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. Market Area and Competition As of December 31, 2007, Danversbank was the seventeenth largest bank in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the second largest banking franchise headquartered in Essex County. Our corporate headquarters is in Danvers, Massachusetts, located approximately 20 miles north of Boston. Over the past ten years, Danversbank has expanded its footprint to include locations in Middlesex and Suffolk Counties. In September 2001, we acquired RFS Bancorp, Inc., the parent company of Revere Federal Savings Bank. In February 2007, we merged BankMalden, a Massachusetts co-operative bank, into Danversbank. The counties in which Danversbank currently operates include a mixture of rural, suburban and urban markets. The economies of these areas were historically based on manufacturing, but, similar to many areas of the country, the underpinnings of these economies are now more service oriented, with employment spread across many economic sectors including service, finance, health-care, technology, real estate and government. While our primary deposit-gathering area is concentrated in Essex and Middlesex Counties in Eastern Massachusetts, our lending area encompasses a somewhat broader market that includes portions of Suffolk County, southern New Hampshire and Rhode Island. We intend to expand geographically into areas contiguous to our existing offices. The majority of our loans are made to customers located in our primary deposit-gathering markets. Our large C&I, commercial real estate and construction lending programs comprise a substantial portion of our total loan portfolio and we intend to continue to focus on the growth of these programs going forward. As of December 31, 2007, loans from these business segments totaled $682.7 million, or 75.1%, of our total loan portfolio. We face substantial competition in our efforts to originate loans and to attract deposits in our primary markets. Achieving meaningful growth is challenging given the number of competitors and the overall decline in the population of our primary market area. We face direct competition from not only locally based community banks but also a significant number of larger financial institutions that have a statewide, regional or national presence. Many of these financial institutions are significantly larger and have greater financial and technological resources than Danversbank. In our commercial real estate lending program, our major competitors also include life insurance companies and to a lesser extent pension 5 funds. We compete with these institutions through competitive pricing coupled with superior service and complemented by very experienced lending teamsespecially in the commercial real estate and C&I markets. Business Strategy Our business objective is to continue franchise growth and improve profitability while remaining a community-oriented financial institution that emphasizes personalized customer service. Over the past 10 years, we have expanded our branch network by establishing 7 de novo branches, acquiring 3 branch banking offices through our acquisition of Revere Federal Savings Bank and merger with BankMalden in 2001 and 2007, respectively, and opening a loan production office in Boston. We have also upgraded 3 branch offices by relocating to full-service facilities in more attractive locations. In addition, our total loan portfolio has grown significantly, both through organic growth and the addition of experienced lending officers. In addition to opening new branches, we intend to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions of non-interest income producing businesses and lending groups that will further expand our loan portfolio or grow our banking franchise. Key elements of our business strategy include: Continue to Expand Our Branch Network. We plan to continue to expand our retail banking franchise and generate additional deposits by increasing the number of full service branch offices. We currently maintain a main office and fourteen other branch locations, which offer extended hours of operation and increased customer convenience. Our branch network is complimented by a combination of 26 in-branch and free-standing ATMs. We opened a new full service branch office in Saugus in July 2007, and we plan to expand our branch network over the next three to four years by adding branches, both within our current footprint and into contiguous markets. Continue to Expand Our C&I and Commercial Real Estate Loan Portfolio. In recent years, we have substantially increased our originations of C&I loans and commercial real estate loans. We have accomplished this, in part, by hiring experienced senior C&I and commercial real estate lenders from other financial institutions operating in our market area in Eastern Massachusetts after their institutions were acquired by larger banks. In some instances this has involved an individual lender and in other cases we executed lift-outs of commercial lending groups known to us. In September 2007, we broadened our C&I lending group by hiring two senior asset-based lenders. We plan to continue to expand our lending group as opportunities arise. Expand Sources of Non-interest Income. We have increased non-interest income in recent periods by introducing additional fee-generating services, such as sales of nondeposit investment and insurance products. We intend to continue to seek to increase non-interest income through these efforts and through selective acquisitions of businesses that generate non-interest income. Increase Transaction Accounts. We have developed various products designed to deepen our relationships with our customers, with the goal of ultimately becoming the customer's operating bank. Among local community banks, we are one of the earlier adopters of a deposit capture product, SnapdepositSM, which enables our commercial checking customers to process deposits and checks electronically from their locations. In addition, we offer and promote retail checking services that offer an above-market rate of interest and are tied to a broad suite of required electronic banking services that include, among others, direct deposit, debit card usage and electronic statements. These services continue to attract new transaction account balances. While we will continue to compete on the basis of rates for certain deposit accounts through the use of periodic market promotions, we are working to reduce our reliance on certificates of deposit, which generally are more costly than transaction accounts and more susceptible to being moved to other institutions offering higher rates. 6 Maintain Asset Quality. We will continue to focus on maintaining a high level of asset quality, which we believe is a key component of long-term financial success. At December 31, 2007, our ratio of total non-performing assets to total assets was 0.55%. We intend to maintain asset quality primarily through our maintenance of prudent underwriting standards. Lending Activities General. Danversbank's gross loan portfolio totaled $909.5 million at December 31, 2007, representing 62.7% of total assets at that date. In its lending activities, Danversbank originates C&I loans, commercial real estate loans, residential and commercial construction loans, residential real estate loans secured by owner-occupied one-to-four-family residences, home equity lines-of-credit, fixed rate home equity loans and other personal consumer loans. Total loans originated totaled $218.9 million in 2007 and $261.6 million in 2006. Loans originated by Danversbank are subject to federal and state laws and regulations. Interest rates charged by Danversbank on its loans are influenced by the demand for such loans, the amount and cost of funding available for lending purposes, current asset/liability management objectives and the interest rates offered by competitors. The following table summarizes the composition of Danversbank's loan portfolio at the dates indicated: December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Real estate mortgages: Construction $ 108,638 11.94 % $ 137,061 15.53 % $ 117,075 14.18 % $ 101,567 13.99 % $ 75,978 11.77 % Residential 180,511 19.85 172,052 19.49 169,047 20.48 156,849 21.61 135,265 20.96 Commercial 234,425 25.78 219,589 24.88 226,752 27.47 213,107 29.35 194,225 30.09 Home equity 36,679 4.03 39,464 4.47 46,395 5.62 46,827 6.45 44,396 6.88 Other loans: C&I 339,669 37.35 304,016 34.44 258,064 31.27 201,028 27.69 186,712 28.93 Consumer 9,564 1.05 10,530 1.19 8,060 0.98 6,640 0.91 8,816 1.37 Total loans 909,486 100.00 % 882,712 100.00 % 825,393 100.00 % 726,018 100.00 % 645,392 100.00 % Allowance for loans losses (9,096 ) (10,412 ) (10,087 ) (9,089 ) (9,153 ) Deferred loan fees, net (989 ) (1,186 ) (1,398 ) (1,256 ) (1,257 ) Loans, net $ 899,401 $ 871,114 $ 813,908 $ 715,673 $ 634,982 C&I Loans. Danversbank originates secured and unsecured C&I loans to business customers in its market area for the purpose of financing equipment purchases, working capital, expansion and other general business purposes. Danversbank originated $102.1 million and $114.4 million in C&I loans during December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007, Danversbank had $339.7 million in C&I loans in its total portfolio, representing 37.4% of such portfolio. Danversbank intends to continue to grow this segment of its lending business in the future as market conditions permit. Danversbank's C&I loans are generally collateralized by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and other fixed assets and are usually supported by personal guarantees. Danversbank offers both term and revolving C&I loans. The term loans have either fixed or adjustable rates of interest and generally 7 fully amortize over a term of between three and seven years. Revolving loans are generally written for a one- year term, renewable annually, with floating interest rates that are indexed to Danversbank's base rate of interest. When making C&I loans, Danversbank considers the financial statements of the borrower, the payment histories of the borrower and guarantor with respect to both corporate and personal debt, the projected cash flows of the business, the viability of the industry in which the borrower operates and the value of the collateral pledged to Danversbank. Danversbank's C&I loans are not concentrated in any single industry. C&I loans generally involve a higher risk of default since their repayment is generally dependent on the successful operation of the borrower's business and the sufficiency of collateral, if any. Repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse changes in the economy. Further, collateral securing such loans may depreciate in value over time and may be difficult to appraise and to liquidate. Commercial Real Estate Loans. Danversbank originated $48.5 million and $35.7 million of commercial real estate loans during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We had $234.4 million of commercial real estate loans in our portfolio as of December 31, 2007. We have placed increasing emphasis on commercial real estate lending over the past several years, and as a result these loans comprise 25.8% of the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2007. Danversbank intends to further increase this segment of its loan portfolio. Danversbank generally originates commercial real estate loans for terms of up to 25 years, typically with interest rates that adjust over periods of one to seven years based on various rate indices plus a margin. Commercial real estate loans are generally secured by non-owner-occupied multi-family income properties, office buildings, retail facilities, warehouses and industrial properties. Generally, commercial real estate loans do not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the underlying collateral at the time the loan is originated. Danversbank monitors concentrations of commercial real estate loans by property type, location and borrower. For any of Danversbank's larger relationships, the extensions of credit are spread over multiple loans, varying property types and locations. In each instance, the relationships are with highly experienced real estate developers that have longstanding relationships or are well known to Danversbank. In its evaluation of a commercial real estate loan application, Danversbank considers the net operating income of the property used as collateral, the creditworthiness of the building's tenant(s), the terms of the respective leases, the borrower's expertise, credit history and the profitability and value of the underlying property. Danversbank generally requires that the properties securing these loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of cash flow before debt service to debt service) of at least 1.20x. As a general practice, Danversbank requires the borrowers seeking commercial real estate loans to provide capital to guarantee those loans. Commercial real estate loans generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than owner-occupied residential mortgage loans. Loan repayment is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties, as well as on the collateral value of the commercial real estate securing the loan. In addition, economic events could have an adverse impact on the cash flows generated by properties securing Danversbank's commercial real estate loans and on the value of such properties Construction Loans. Danversbank originates construction loans for one- to four-family homes, residential condominiums, commercial, multi-family and other nonresidential purposes. Construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the term of the loan, which is usually twelve to twenty-four months. One- to four-family residential and residential condominium construction loans are made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75%. Commercial, multi-family and other nonresidential construction loans are made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75% of the 8 upon-completion market value of the real estate and improvements. Danversbank originated $25.2 million and $55.7 million of construction loans during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We had $108.6 million of construction loans in our portfolio as of December 31, 2007. The construction loans are usually written with variable interest rates adjusted to each change in the prime lending rate plus a margin. Danversbank began to reduce its exposure to construction lending in mid-2006 in response to a general downturn in the single-family residential and residential condominium markets, which is lengthening the amount of time required to sell the units that are built. As with our commercial real estate loan portfolio, we monitor concentrations of construction loans by property type, by location and relative to the amount of construction financing extended to any one borrower. In addition, management monitors the aggregate number of speculative units that Danversbank finances at any one time. There are also limits on the number of speculative units financed for any one borrower or any specific construction project. This limit is established at two units per project. However, exceptions to this policy are occasionally granted when the project involves a single building with multiple units. Danversbank's construction lending footprint encompasses an area similar to the franchise branch network, with the highest concentration, at 9% of the portfolio, located in Danvers. Similar to the institution's commercial real estate portfolio, Danversbank has several large construction loan relationships with individual borrowers, but in each instance the relationship encompasses multiple loans, secured by varying types of properties in different locations. The borrowers involved are highly experienced real estate developers that have longstanding relationships with either a senior lending officer or Danversbank. At December 31, 2007, Danversbank's portfolio of construction loans was comprised of 44.4% residential condominiums, 25.2% single-family homes and subdivisions, 19.7% non-residential commercial real estate, 6.5% land loans, 0.5% apartment construction loans and 3.7% owner occupied residential construction loans. Based on our assessment that the inventory of residential condominiums listed for sale is continuing to decrease in our market area, we do not expect that the concentration of residential condominium construction loans will have a material impact on our revenues or net income. Construction loans generally involve a greater degree of risk than permanent commercial and residential loan financing. Loan repayment is dependent on the successful completion of the project at an as completed value commensurate with the market value of the real estate and improvements. In addition, economic events could have an adverse impact on our construction loan portfolio and on the value of such properties. Owner Occupied Residential Real Estate Loans. Danversbank offers fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans for owner-occupied residential real estate with maturities of up to 40 years and maximum loan amounts generally of up to $3.0 million. As of December 31, 2007, this portfolio totaled $180.5 million, or 19.9% of the total loan portfolio. Of the residential mortgage loans outstanding on that date, $140.4 million were adjustable-rate loans with an average yield of 5.53%, and $40.1 million were fixed-rate mortgage loans with an average yield of 5.77%. Residential mortgage loan originations totaled $29.4 million and $41.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Danversbank does not originate or purchase any sub-prime residential mortgage loans. The decision to originate loans for portfolio or for sale into the secondary market is made by Danversbank's Asset/Liability Management Committee, or ALCO, and is based on the borrower's interest rate risk profile. Residential mortgage loans sold into the secondary market, on a servicing retained basis, totaled $1.0 million in 2007 and $15.4 million during 2006. Our current practice is to sell substantially all newly originated fixed-rate 20 and 30-year residential mortgage loans. These loans are underwritten in accordance with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae standards and sold immediately after being originated by Danversbank. Newly originated, fixed-rate 10 and 15-year loans are typically held in portfolio. At December 31, 2007, fixed-rate residential mortgage loans held in the portfolio totaled $40.1 million, or 22.2% of total residential real estate mortgage loans. Danversbank services loans sold 9 to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and earns a fee equal to 0.25% of the loan amounts outstanding for providing these services. The total of residential mortgage loans serviced for others as of December 31, 2007 was $55.9 million. The adjustable-rate mortgage, or ARM, loans offered by Danversbank make up the largest component of the residential mortgage loans held in portfolio. At December 31, 2007, ARM loans totaled $140.4 million or 77.8% of total residential loans outstanding at that date. ARM's are offered for terms of up to 40 years with initial interest rates that are fixed for 1, 3, 5 or 10 years. After the initial fixed-rate period, the interest rates on the loans are reset based on the relevant U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity Treasury, or CMT, Index plus margins of varying percentages, for periods of 1 year. Interest rate adjustments on such loans typically range from 2.0% to 3.0% during any adjustment period and 5.0% to 6.0% over the life of the loan. Periodic adjustments in the interest rates charged on ARM Loans help to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates. However, ARM loans generally possess an element of credit risk not inherent in fixed-rate mortgage loans, in that borrowers are potentially exposed to increases in debt service requirements over the life of the loan in the event market interest rates rise. The possibility of higher payments is taken into account during our underwriting process and many of our residential mortgage loans are made to existing Danversbank customers. For our residential mortgage loan originations held in portfolio, Danversbank lends up to a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 100% for first-time home buyers and 100% for other buyers on mortgage loans secured by owner-occupied property, with the condition that private mortgage insurance is generally required for loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80%. Title insurance, hazard insurance and, if appropriate, flood insurance are required for all properties securing real estate loans made by Danversbank. A licensed appraiser appraises all properties securing residential first mortgage purchase loans and all real estate transactions greater than $250,000. In an effort to provide financing for low and moderate-income first-time home buyers, Danversbank originates and services residential mortgage loans with private mortgage insurance provided by the Mortgage Insurance Fund, MIF, of the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency. The program provides mortgage payment protection as an enhancement to mortgage insurance coverage. This no-cost benefit, known as MI Plus, provides up to six monthly principal and interest payments in the event that a borrower becomes unemployed. Home Equity Lines-of-Credit and Loans. Danversbank offers home equity lines-of-credit and home equity term loans. Danversbank originated $11.0 million and $11.6 million of home equity lines-of-credit and loans during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007, we had $36.7 million of home equity lines-of-credit and loans outstanding. Danversbank does not originate or purchase any sub-prime home equity loans or lines. Home equity lines-of-credit and loans are secured by second mortgages on one-to-four family owner occupied properties, and are made in amounts such that the combined first and second mortgage balances generally do not exceed 80% of the value of the property serving as collateral at time of origination. The lines-of-credit are available to be drawn upon for 10 years, at the end of which time they become term loans amortized over 10 years. Interest rates on home equity lines normally adjust based on the prime rate of interest as published by The Wall Street Journal. The undrawn portion of home equity lines-of-credit totaled $37.2 million at December 31, 2007. Consumer and Other Loans. Danversbank offers a variety of consumer and other loans, including unsecured personal loans, automobile loans, loans secured by passbook savings or term certificate accounts, overdraft lines of credit, boat and recreational vehicle loans and loans to help finance the cost of education, including primary, secondary and graduate school. Danversbank originated $2.8 million and $3.0 million of consumer and other loans during the year ended December 31, 2007 10 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007, we had $9.6 million of consumer and other loans outstanding. Loan Origination and Underwriting. The primary source of originations is our salaried loan personnel, and to a lesser extent, local mortgage brokers, advertising and referrals from customers. In a few instances, Danversbank has purchased participation interests in commercial real estate loans from banks located outside of Essex County. Danversbank underwrites such purchased loans using its own underwriting criteria. Danversbank issues loan commitments to prospective borrowers conditioned on the occurrence of certain events. Commitments are made in writing on specified terms and conditions and are generally honored for up to 60 days from approval. At December 31, 2007, Danversbank had loan commitments and unadvanced loans and lines-of-credit totaling $247.6 million. For information about loan commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2007, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskLoan Commitments" on page 64. Danversbank charges origination fees, or points, and collects fees to cover the costs of appraisals and credit reports on most residential mortgage loans originated. Danversbank also collects late charges on real estate loans, and origination fees and prepayment penalties on commercial mortgage loans and some types of C&I loans. For information regarding Danversbank's recognition of loan fees and costs, please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-7.

Residential mortgage loans greater than $750,000 require the approval of the Board of Investment of the board of directors of Danversbank. Commercial real estate and C&I loans are underwritten by commercial credit analysts. For commercial real estate loans, loan officers may approve loans up to their individual lending limits, which range from $100,000 to $500,000, while loans up to $1.0 million may be approved by the Senior Lending Officer and Danversbank's Chief Executive Officer. Danversbank's Senior Lending Officer may approve C&I loans of up to $1 million, while its Loan Committee may approve loans of up to $2.0 million. Loans over these limits require the approval of the Board of Investment of the board of directors of Danversbank. Consumer loans are underwritten by consumer loan underwriters who have approval authorities ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 for unsecured borrowings and up to $750,000 for secured borrowings. Several senior lenders have authority to approve unsecured consumer loans up to $500,000 and secured borrowing up to $1.0 million. Loans above these limits require the approval of the Board of Investment of the board of directors of Danversbank. Pursuant to its loan policy, Danversbank generally will not make loans aggregating more than 15% of retained earnings, or $14.9 million as of December 31, 2007, to one borrower or related entity. Danversbank's internal lending limit is lower than the Massachusetts legal lending limit, which is 20.0% of a bank's capital stock, surplus and undivided profits, or $19.9 million for Danversbank as of December 31, 2007. As a result of the conversion, the Bank's statutory legal lending limit will significantly increase. Danversbank has established a risk rating system for its commercial real estate, commercial construction and C&I loans. This system evaluates a number of factors useful in indicating the risk of default and risk of loss associated with a loan. These ratings are performed by commercial credit analysts who do not have responsibility for loan originations. See "BusinessAsset QualityClassification of Assets and Loan Review" on page 15. 12 Loan Maturity. The following table summarizes the scheduled repayments based on the contractual maturity of Danversbank's loan portfolio at December 31, 2007. Demand loans, loans having no stated repayment schedule, and overdraft loans are reported as being due in one year or less. At December 31, 2007 Real estate mortgages Construction Residential Commercial Home Equity C&I Consumer Total Amounts Due: One year or less $ 70,432 $ 294 $ 16,984 $  $ 23,547 $ 582 $ 111,839 After one year: One to three years 31,699 347 25,485  50,422 1,224 109,177 Three to five years 435 443 9,121  23,003 1,637 34,639 Five to ten years 777 11,454 19,018 1,158 42,231 2,420 77,058 Ten to twenty years 141 14,028 124,494 29,326 101,846 3,123 272,958 Over twenty years 5,154 153,945 39,323 6,195 98,620 578 303,815 Total due after one year 38,206 180,217 217,441 36,679 316,122 8,982 797,647 Total loans $ 108,638 $ 180,511 $ 234,425 $ 36,679 $ 339,669 $ 9,564 909,486 Allowance for loans losses (9,096 ) Deferred loan fees, net (989 ) Net loans $ 899,401 The following table sets forth the dollar amount of total loans, net of unadvanced funds on loans, contractually due after December 31, 2008 and whether such loans have fixed interest rates or adjustable interest rates. Fixed Adjustable Total (In thousands) Real estate mortgages: Construction $ 1,227 $ 36,979 $ 38,206 Residential 39,792 140,425 180,217 Commercial 28,678 188,763 217,441 Home equity 1,272 35,407 36,679 C&I 56,415 259,707 316,122 Consumer 8,525 457 8,982 Total loans $ 135,909 $ 661,738 $ 797,647 Asset Quality General. One of Danversbank's most important operating objectives is to maintain a high level of asset quality. Management uses a number of strategies in furtherance of this goal, including what we believe to be maintaining sound credit standards in loan originations, monitoring the loan portfolio through internal and third-party loan reviews, and employing active collection and workout processes for delinquent or problem loans. Delinquent Loans. Management performs a monthly review of all delinquent loans. The actions taken with respect to delinquencies vary depending upon the nature of the delinquent loans and the period of delinquency. Generally, Danversbank's policy is to mail a delinquency notice no later than the 11th or 16th day, depending on loan type, after the payment due date. A late charge is normally assessed on loans where the scheduled payment remains unpaid after a 10 or 15 day grace period, once again dependent on the loan type. After mailing delinquency notices, Danversbank's loan collection personnel call the borrower to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment. 13 On loans secured by one- to four-family owner-occupied property, Danversbank initially attempts to work out a payment schedule with the borrower in order to avoid foreclosure. Any such loan restructurings must be approved by the level of officer authority required for a new loan of that amount. If these actions do not result in a satisfactory resolution, Danversbank refers the loan to legal counsel and counsel initiates foreclosure proceedings. For commercial real estate, construction and C&I loans, collection procedures may vary somewhat depending on the circumstances and size of the relationship. The following table sets forth our loan delinquencies by type and by amount at the dates indicated. Loans Delinquent For 30-89 Days 90 Days and Over Total Number Amount Number Amount Number Amount (Dollars in thousands) At December 31, 2007: Real estate mortgages: Construction 1 $ 1,171 5 $ 2,618 6 $ 3,789 Residential 12 1,676 7 1,225 19 2,901 Commercial 1 247   1 247 Home equity 2 278 3 64 5 342 Total real estate mortgages 16 3,372 15 3,907 31 7,279 C&I 5 682 3 451 8 1,133 Consumer 13 51 11 29 24 80 Total 34 $ 4,105 29 $ 4,387 63 $ 8,492 At December 31, 2006: Real estate mortgages: Construction  $  1 $ 3,618 1 $ 3,618 Residential 9 946 5 791 14 1,737 Commercial 1 165   1 165 Home equity 2 288 2 61 4 349 Total real estate mortgages 12 1,399 8 4,470 20 5,869 C&I 3 201 15 1,265 18 1,466 Consumer 10 50 7 17 17 67 Total 25 $ 1,650 30 $ 5,752 55 $ 7,402 Other Real Estate Owned. Danversbank classifies property acquired through foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure as other real estate owned, or OREO, in its consolidated financial statements. When property is classified as OREO, it is recorded at the lower of the carrying value or the fair value less estimated costs to sell at the date of foreclosure or acceptance of deed in lieu of foreclosure. At the time of classification as OREO, any excess of carrying value over fair value is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management taking into consideration estimated costs to complete, current economic conditions, selling prices and estimated selling costs. A valuation allowance is established to record the asset at the lower of cost or fair value less selling costs. Due to changing market conditions, there are inherent uncertainties in the assumptions with respect to the estimated fair value of OREO. Therefore, the amount ultimately realized may differ from the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Holding costs and declines in fair value result in charges to expense after the property is acquired. 14 At December 31, 2007 Danversbank had $3.5 million in property classified as OREO. The two components of the Company's OREO property are a 21 lot one-to-four family housing subdivision totaling $3.4 million and a one-to-four family housing lot totaling $82,000. In connection with the completion of the subdivision property, the Company has entered into a performance guarantee agreement with a third party for the completion of the infrastructure amounting to $1,243,000. Classification of Assets and Loan Review. Danversbank uses an internal rating system to monitor and evaluate the credit risk inherent in its loan portfolio. At the time a loan is approved, all commercial real estate and C&I loans are assigned a risk rating based on all of the factors considered in originating the loan. The initial risk rating is recommended by the credit analyst charged with underwriting the loan, and subsequently approved by the relevant loan approval authority. Current financial information is required for all commercial real estate and C&I borrowing relationships, and is evaluated on at least an annual basis to determine whether the risk rating classification is appropriate. In Danversbank's loan rating system, there are four classified asset categories: special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss. An asset is classified special mention if it is currently protected but potentially weak. Potential concerns are that the borrower is exposed to unfavorable economic conditions, adverse operating trends or an unbalanced financial statement condition that could jeopardize the repayment of the loan. Other areas of exposure include an improperly supervised loan due to lack of officer expertise, an inadequate loan agreement, concerns over the condition or control of the collateral, lack of proper documentation or there is some other deviation from prudent lending practices that warrants such a classification. An asset is classified substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets are characterized by the distinct possibility that Danversbank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified doubtful have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full questionable, on the basis of currently existing facts, and there is a high probability of loss. If an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss, it is charged off in the quarter in which it is so classified. Assets classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that to maintain it as an asset of Danversbank is not warranted. Assets that possess some weaknesses, but that do not expose Danversbank to risk sufficient to warrant classification as substandard, doubtful or loss, are designated as special mention. For assets designated as special mention, or classified substandard or doubtful, Danversbank establishes reserves in amounts management deems appropriate within the allowance for loan losses. This determination as to the classification of assets and the amount of the loss allowances are subject to review by regulatory agencies, which can order the establishment of additional loss allowances. See "BusinessAsset QualityAllowance for Loan Losses" on page 16 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationCritical Accounting PoliciesAllowance for Loan Losses" on page 50. Danversbank currently engages an independent third party to conduct a review of its commercial real estate and C&I loan portfolios three times per year. These loan reviews provide a credit evaluation of individual loans to determine whether the risk ratings assigned are appropriate. Independent loan review findings are presented directly to the Audit Committee of the board of directors. At December 31, 2007, loans classified as special mention totaled $7.1 million, or 0.78%, of the loan portfolio. Special mention loans consisted of $870,000 in commercial real estate loans and $6.3 million in C&I loans. Loans classified as substandard totaled $5.9 million, or 0.60% of the loan portfolio, and the balance was made up of $2.7 million in commercial real estate loans and $3.2 million in C&I loans. There were no loans classified as doubtful at December 31, 2007. 15 Non-Performing Assets. The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non-performing assets at the dates indicated. December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Nonaccrual loans: Real estate mortgages: Construction $ 2,618 $ 3,618 $ 231 $ 266 $ 484 Residential 1,225 791 649 410 702 Commercial      Home equity 64 61 329 308 439 Total real estate mortgages 3,907 4,470 1,209 984 1,625 C&I 451 1,265 1,340 901 2,006 Consumer 29 17 27 20 105 Total $ 4,387 $ 5,752 $ 2,576 $ 1,905 $ 3,736 Total non-performing loans $ 4,387 $ 5,752 $ 2,576 $ 1,905 $ 3,736 Other real estate owned 3,513   1,307  Total non-performing assets $ 7,900 $ 5,752 $ 2,576 $ 3,212 $ 3,736 Total non-performing loans to total loans 0.48 % 0.65 % 0.31 % 0.26 % 0.58 % Total non-performing loans to total assets 0.30 % 0.46 % 0.22 % 0.18 % 0.40 % Total non-performing assets to total assets 0.55 % 0.46 % 0.22 % 0.30 % 0.40 % If the non-accrual loans presented in the table above had been current, the gross interest income that would have been recorded for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $140,000. Interest income of $150,000 and $151,000 from these loans was recognized on a cash basis and recorded in the net income for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Loans are placed on non-accrual status either when reasonable doubt exists as to the full timely collection of interest and principal, or when a loan becomes 90 days past due, unless an evaluation by management clearly indicates that the loan is well-secured and in the process of collection. Restructured loans represent performing loans for which concessions were granted due to a borrower's financial condition. Such concessions may include reductions of interest rates to below-market terms and/or extension of repayment terms. There were no restructured loans at December 31, 2007. Allowance for Loan Losses. In originating loans, Danversbank recognizes that losses will be experienced on loans and that the risk of loss may vary with many factors, including the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan, general economic conditions and, in the case of a secured loan, the quality of the collateral for the loan over the term of the loan. Danversbank maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio. This allowance represents management's best estimate of the probable known and inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and the board of directors and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical loss experience, portfolio volume and mix, geographic and large borrower concentrations, estimated credit losses based on internal and external portfolio reviews, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as circumstances change or as more information becomes available. 16 The allowance consists of allocated, general and unallocated components. The allocated component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For such loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of the loan. The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management's estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and general losses in the portfolio. In particular, management has maintained an unallocated reserve large enough to account for a concentration in our commercial real estate portfolio, and more specifically in our construction loan portfolio, that relates to a segment of our originations made prior to 2002 that possess underwriting characteristics and terms that are not consistent with the underwriting guidelines and credit administration processes that have been in effect since that time. The majority of these projects are now either complete or have refinanced elsewhere. In some instances, however, the projects have gone into foreclosure and we have sustained above average losses as a result. See "BusinessAsset Quality Delinquent Loans" and "BusinessAsset QualityOther Real Estate Owned" on pages 13 and 14. While the risks associated with this segment have been substantially reduced, the current unallocated portion of our reserve reflects management's difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly between the few remaining credits that possess these underwriting characteristics and subsequent loss rates. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent. Currently, all impaired loans have been measured through the collateral method. All loans on nonaccrual status and restructured troubled debts are considered to be impaired. When the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the impairment is recorded through the valuation allowance. All loans are individually evaluated for impairment according to the Bank's normal loan review process, including overall credit evaluation and rating, nonaccrual status and payment experience. At December 31, 2007, impaired loans totaled $4.4 million and had an aggregate valuation allowance of $273,000. While management is of the opinion that it has established adequate allocations and general allowances for losses on loans, adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary if future conditions differ substantially from the information used in making the evaluations. In addition, as an integral part of their respective audit and examination processes, Danversbank's external auditors and regulators periodically review the allowance for loan losses. They may require management to recognize adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their review, and the adjustments could negatively impact the bank's financial condition and earnings. 17 The following table sets forth activity in Danversbank's allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated: At or For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Allowance balance at beginning of year $ 10,412 $ 10,087 $ 9,089 $ 9,153 $ 8,070 Provision for loan losses 800 1,000 1,250 750 1,700 Charge-offs: Real estate mortgages: Construction 1,400 21  249 150 Residential 29   5 33 Commercial      Home equity 1 3    Total real estate mortgages 1,430 24  254 183 C&I 715 605 331 804 562 Consumer 73 92 80 153 140 Total charge-offs 2,218 721 411 1,211 885 Recoveries: Real estate mortgages: Construction   5 181 5 Residential     33 Commercial   2  113 Home equity 1     Total real estate mortgages 1  7 181 151 C&I 52 20 118 153 40 Consumer 49 26 34 63 77 Total recoveries 102 46 159 397 268 Net charge-offs 2,116 675 252 814 617 Allowance balance at end of year $ 9,096 $ 10,412 $ 10,087 $ 9,089 $ 9,153 Total loans outstanding $ 909,486 $ 882,712 $ 825,393 $ 726,018 $ 645,392 Average loans outstanding $ 870,569 $ 873,150 $ 778,443 $ 691,604 $ 625,954 Allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans outstanding 1.00 % 1.18 % 1.22 % 1.25 % 1.42 % Net loans charged off as a percent of average loans outstanding 0.24 % 0.08 % 0.03 % 0.12 % 0.10 % Allowance for loan losses to non- performing loans 207.34 % 181.02 % 391.58 % 477.11 % 244.99 % 18 Our allowance for loan losses to total loans was 1.18% or above from December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2006. Our allowance for loan losses to total loans was 1.00% at December 31, 2007. Consistent with the discussion in the "Allowance for Loan Losses" section and a certain segment of the loan portfolio underwritten prior to 2002, the allowance as a percentage of gross loans has declined as the majority of these originations have paid off or as previous underwriting deficiencies have been resolved. The following table sets forth Danversbank's percent of allowance by loan category and the percent of the loans to total loans in each of the categories listed at the dates indicated. The allowance for loan losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories: December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Real estate mortgages: Construction $ 1,607 11.94 % $ 1,567 15.53 % $ 1,535 14.18 % $ 1,382 13.99 % $ 1,168 11.77 % Residential 458 19.85 506 19.49 492 20.48 460 21.61 422 20.96 Commercial 2,353 25.78 2,042 24.88 2,107 27.47 2,029 29.35 1,842 30.09 Home equity 187 4.03 187 4.47 223 5.62 227 6.45 226 6.88 C&I 3,854 37.35 3,696 34.44 3,221 31.27 2,815 27.69 2,725 28.93 Consumer 76 1.05 69 1.19 41 0.98 50 0.91 126 1.37 Unallocated 561  2,345  2,468  2,126  2,644  Total allowances $ 9,096 100.00 % $ 10,412 100.00 % $ 10,087 100.00 % $ 9,089 100.00 % $ 9,153 100.00 % Prior to 2007, management has maintained an unallocated reserve large enough to account for a concentration in our commercial real estate portfolio, and more specifically in our construction loan portfolio, that relates to a segment of our originations made prior to 2002 that possess underwriting characteristics and terms that are not consistent with the underwriting guidelines and credit administration processes that have been in effect since that time. The majority of these projects are now either complete or have refinanced elsewhere and the unallocated portion if the reserve has been reduced accordingly. Investment Activities General. The board of directors is responsible for establishing our investment policy. The Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer are authorized by the board of directors to implement this policy based on the established guidelines documented in Danversbank's Investment Policy. The primary objective of the investment portfolio is to achieve a competitive rate of return without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, to complement our lending activities, to provide and maintain liquidity, and to assist in managing the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet. Individual investment decisions are made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, cash flow targets, and consistency with Danversbank's investment policy and asset/liability management objectives. Both Danversbank and the holding company adhere to the same investment policy guidelines. Pursuant to SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, our investment securities are classified as available for sale, held to maturity, or trading, depending on our intent with regard to the investment at the time of acquisition. At December 31, 2007, $406.7 million or 100% of the portfolio was classified as available for sale. None of Danversbank's investment securities are classified as held to maturity at the present time. At December 31, 2007, the net unrealized gain on securities classified as available for sale was $3.8 million, before tax effect. We do not currently 19 maintain a trading portfolio of securities. At December 31, 2007, we did not hold securities of any issuers, as defined in Section 2(4) of the Securities Act, excluding those securities issued by U.S. Government or government-sponsored enterprises, in which the aggregate book value of such securities exceeded 10% of our equity. U.S. Government and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. The largest segment of our investment portfolio is comprised of debt securities issued by the U.S. Government and government-sponsored enterprises. While these debt securities provide somewhat lower yields compared to other investments in our portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent we deem appropriate, for liquidity purposes, as collateral for borrowings and other public funds. At December 31, 2007, our U.S. Government and government-sponsored enterprise securities portfolio had an average maturity of 6.1 years and totaled $222.9 million, or 54.8% of Danversbank's total investment portfolio. Municipal Obligations. In recent periods, Danversbank has increased the amount of its investment in municipal bonds due to the tax advantages they provide. At December 31, 2007, our portfolio of municipal obligations totaled $18.4 million, or 4.5% of the portfolio at that date. Our policy requires that purchases of municipal obligations be restricted to those obligations that are rated "B" or better by a nationally recognized rating agency, are bank qualified and mature in thirty years or less. At December 31, 2007, all investments in municipal obligations met these criteria and all of our holdings were privately insured. Mortgage-Backed Securities. At December 31, 2007, our portfolio of mortgage-backed securities totaled $165.1 million, or 40.6% of the investment portfolio on that date, and consisted exclusively of pass-through securities that are directly insured or guaranteed by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae. Danversbank uses mortgage-backed securities as a source of liquidity and to supplement its lending activities. These securities are backed by pools of mortgages that have loans with interest rates that are within a set range and have varying maturities. These securities are frequently referred to as mortgage participation certificates or pass-through certificates. The interest rate risk characteristics of the underlying pool of mortgages and the prepayment risk are passed on to the certificate holder. The life of the pass-through security is equal to the life of the underlying mortgages. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities due to scheduled repayments and the fact that the underlying borrowers have the right to prepay their mortgage with or without penalty at any time. In our purchase of mortgage-backed obligations, we have targeted instruments with five to twelve year weighted average lives, with expected average life extensions up to a maximum of fifteen years in a rising rate environment. The objective of this strategy has been to limit the potential interest rate risk due to extension of this portfolio in a rising rate environment. None of our mortgage-backed securities have sub-prime residential mortgage or home equity loans as part of their underlying loan pools. 20 The following table sets forth certain information regarding the amortized cost and market values of securities available for sale at the dates indicated: December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value (In thousands) Debt securities: U.S. Government $ 2,000 $ 2,021 $ 2,245 $ 2,241 $ 2,992 $ 2,974 Government-sponsored enterprises 217,929 220,830 221,359 219,024 238,910 233,606 Mortgage-backed 164,062 165,091 46,036 45,477 22,884 22,217 Municipal bonds 18,569 18,442 5,918 5,879 1,157 1,132 Other bonds 328 331 353 357 364 384 Total debt securities 402,888 406,715 275,911 272,978 266,307 260,313 Preferred stocks   101 105 101 103 Total securities available for sale $ 402,888 $ 406,715 $ 276,012 $ 273,083 $ 266,408 $ 260,416 The table below sets forth certain information regarding the amortized cost, weighted average yields and contractual maturities of our debt securities portfolio at December 31, 2007.

Deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities. In addition to deposits, we obtain funds from the amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, the sale or maturity of investment securities, advances from the FHLBB, repurchase agreements, and cash flows generated by operations. Deposits. We gather consumer and commercial deposits through the offering of a broad selection of deposit products, including checking, regular savings, money market deposits, term certificates and individual retirement accounts. The FDIC insures deposits up to certain limits, which are generally $100,000 per depositor, and the DIF insures amounts in excess of these limits. 21 The maturities of term certificates range from one month to five years. In order to attract deposit and loan business, we offer a variety of commercial business products to small businesses operating within our primary market area. Among local community banks, we are one of the early adopters of a remote deposit capture product, SnapdepositSM, which enables our business customers to process deposits and checks electronically from their locations. We accept deposits of $100,000 or more from customers within our market area based primarily on posted rates but from time to time negotiate the rate on these instruments commensurate with the size of the deposit. We also generate term certificates through the use of brokers and internet-based network deposits. Brokered and network deposits totaled $20.0 million and $70.0 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We rely primarily on competitive pricing of our deposit products, customer service and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits. Market interest rates, rates offered by financial service competitors, the availability of other investment alternatives, and general economic conditions significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposit balances.

Danversbank utilizes short-term and long-term advances from the FHLBB as an alternative to retail deposits to fund its operations as part of its operating strategy. FHLBB advances are secured primarily by certain residential mortgage loans and investment securities and secondarily by our investment in capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank. Advances are made pursuant to several FHLBB credit programs, each of which has its own terms, interest rates and range of maturities. The maximum amount that the FHLBB will advance to member institutions fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the Federal Home Loan Bank. At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding $145.0 million in FHLBB advances and had the ability to borrow up to a total of $272.1 million based on available collateral. Of the $145.0 million in advances outstanding at December 31, 2007, $134.8 million, bearing a weighted average interest rate of 4.62%, are callable by the FHLBB at various intervals in their respective contracts. In the event that the FHLBB calls some of these advances, we will evaluate our liquidity and interest rate sensitivity position at that time and determine whether to replace the called advances with new borrowings. In addition to FHLBB advances, Danversbank's borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, or repurchase agreements. Repurchase agreements are contracts for the sale of securities owned by Danversbank, in this case to large commercial deposit customers, with an agreement to repurchase those securities at an agreed upon price and date. Danversbank uses repurchase agreements as a means of offering some of its commercial deposit customers a commercial sweep checking product. The collateral for these repurchase agreements comes from Danversbank's portfolio of U.S. Government and government-sponsored enterprises obligations and all of the contracts and related borrowings are overnight. At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding $23.8 million in overnight repurchase agreements with certain commercial deposit customers. 23 The following table sets forth certain information concerning balances and interest rates on our borrowing at the dates and for the periods indicated: At and For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Short-term borrowings: Balance at end of period: Federal Home Loan Bank advances $  $  $ 83,700 Repurchase agreements 23,800 30,934 35,782 Total short-term borrowings $ 23,800 $ 30,934 $ 119,482 Average balance during the period: Federal Home Loan Bank advances $ 9,798 $ 18,574 $ 45,869 Repurchase agreements 33,857 35,301 39,806 Total short-term borrowings $ 43,655 $ 53,875 $ 85,675 Maximum outstanding at any month period: Federal Home Loan Bank advances $ 42,000 $ 61,600 $ 83,700 Repurchase agreements 50,308 44,072 44,187 Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Federal Home Loan Bank advances 0.00 % 0.00 % 4.06 % Repurchase agreements 2.04 % 1.48 % 1.34 % Total short-term borrowings 2.04 % 1.48 % 3.25 % Average interest rate during period: Federal Home Loan Bank advances 5.34 % 5.02 % 3.54 % Repurchase agreements 1.83 % 1.44 % 1.17 % Total short-term borrowings 2.61 % 2.67 % 2.44 % Long-term debt: Balance at end of period $ 145,042 $ 167,899 $ 71,235 Average balance during the period 148,265 158,634 79,571 Maximum outstanding at any month period 150,494 179,759 110,747 Weighted average interest rate at end of period 4.59 % 4.46 % 4.31 % Average interest rate during period 4.66 % 4.51 % 4.34 % Subordinated debt: Balance at end of period $ 29,965 $ 29,965 $ 24,810 Average balance during the period 29,965 26,251 24,810 Maximum outstanding at any month period 29,965 29,965 24,810 Weighted average interest rate at end of period 8.78 % 8.99 % 9.02 % Average interest rate during period 8.65 % 8.75 % 8.22 % Employees As of December 31, 2007, the Company has 220 full time and 42 part-time employees. Employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Subsidiary Activities Conant Investment Corporation and Danvers Square Investment Corporation. Conant Investment Corporation and Danvers Square Investment Corporation are wholly-owned subsidiaries of 24 Danversbank that qualify as Massachusetts securities corporations through which Danversbank buys, sells and holds securities on Danversbank's behalf. These subsidiaries maintain accounts at Danversbank, on terms and conditions generally available to regular customers, for the primary purpose of accumulating current earnings, payments and/or maturities from their securities until a level is reached that would allow the acquisition of additional securities at the normal level purchased by the corporation. The accounts are limited in amount and time so as to reasonably reflect the need for holding cash in an interest-bearing account on a short-term, temporary basis pending reinvestment. On a quarterly basis the activity of these subsidiaries is reviewed to determine if a dividend is required to be declared and paid to Danversbank in order to be in compliance with Massachusetts DOR Regulations promulgated July 14, 2006. One Conant Capital LLC. One Conant Capital LLC is a limited liability company formed in 2006 under the Massachusetts Limited Liability Company Act, as amended. The establishment and purpose of the LLC as an operating subsidiary of Danversbank, pursuant to Massachusetts law, is to originate and hold loans secured by real estate, to originate and hold commercial and industrial loans, and to engage in any other activity in which Danversbank itself may engage. One Conant Capital LLC had aggregate loan balances of $24.0 million at December 31, 2007. Conant Ventures, Inc. Conant Ventures, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Danversbank that is allowed to engage in real estate investment activities permissible for a Massachusetts bank as defined in section 362 of the FDIC's Rules and Regulations. The subsidiary is effectively inactive but is utilized from time to time to hold deeds of properties that Danversbank takes into Other Real Estate Owned, or OREO. Conant Ventures, Inc. has not engaged in any real estate investment activities since 2000. Regulation and Supervision General The Company is a Delaware corporation and a bank holding company ("BHC") registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve Board") under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"). The Company has one bank subsidiary, Danversbank that is a Massachusetts-charted stock savings bank. The Company has not elected Financial Holding Company ("FHC") status under the BHCA and, accordingly, may not engage in certain financial activities, such as merchant banking, that are only authorized under the BHCA for BHCs that have elected FHC status. Danversbank's deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC and by the Depositors Insurance Fund for amounts in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. Danversbank is subject to regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, as its deposit insurer. Danversbank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and borrowers and, for purposes of the FDIC, the protection of the insurance fund. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in these statutory or regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the Massachusetts legislature, the FDIC or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Company, Danversbank and their operations. Danversbank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, or FHLB. 25 Certain regulatory requirements applicable to Danversbank and to the Company are referred to below or elsewhere herein. The description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to savings institutions and their holding companies set forth below and elsewhere in this document does not purport to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Danversbank and the Company and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. Massachusetts Bank Regulation General. As a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank, Danversbank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and to various Massachusetts statutes and regulations which govern, among other things, investment powers, lending and deposit-taking activities, borrowings, maintenance of retained earnings and reserve accounts, distribution of earnings and payment of dividends. In addition, Danversbank is subject to Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights laws and regulations. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks or the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation is required for a Massachusetts-chartered bank to establish or close branches, merge with other financial institutions, organize a holding company, issue stock and undertake certain other activities. In response to Massachusetts laws enacted in the last few years, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks adopted rules that generally allow Massachusetts banks to engage in activities permissible for federally chartered banks or banks chartered by another state. The Commissioner also has adopted procedures reducing regulatory burdens and expense and expediting branching by well-capitalized and well-managed banks that have "satisfactory" or higher Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") records. Investment Activities. In general, Massachusetts-chartered savings banks may invest in preferred and common stock of any corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state provided such investments do not involve control of any corporation and do not, in the aggregate, exceed 4.0% of the bank's deposits. Massachusetts-chartered savings banks may in addition invest an amount equal to 1.0% of their deposits in equity securities of Massachusetts corporations or companies with substantial employment in Massachusetts, which have pledged to the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks that such monies will be used for further development within the Commonwealth. However, these powers are constrained by federal law. See "BusinessRegulation and SupervisionFederal Bank RegulationInvestment Activities" on page 28 for federal restrictions on equity investments. Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitations. Massachusetts banking law grants broad lending authority. However, with certain limited exceptions, total obligations of one borrower to a bank may not exceed 20.0% of the total of the bank's capital stock, surplus and undivided profits. Loans to a Bank's Insiders. The Massachusetts banking laws prohibit any executive officer, director or trustee from borrowing, otherwise becoming indebted, or becoming liable for a loan or other extension of credit by such bank to any other person, except for any of the following loans or extensions of credit: (i) loans or extension of credit, secured or unsecured, to an officer of the bank in an amount not exceeding $100,000; (ii) loans or extensions of credit intended or secured for educational purposes to an officer of the bank in an amount not exceeding $200,000; (iii) loans or extensions of credit secured by a mortgage on residential real estate to be occupied in whole or in part by the officer to whom the loan or extension of credit is made, in an amount not exceeding $750,000; and (iv) loans or extensions of credit to a director or trustee of the bank who is not also an officer of the bank in an amount permissible under the bank's loan to one borrower limit. The loans listed above require the prior approval of the majority of the members of Danversbank's board of directors, excluding any member involved in the loan or extension of credit. No such loan or extension of credit may be granted with an interest rate or other terms that are preferential in comparison to loans granted to persons not affiliated with the savings bank. 26 Dividends. A Massachusetts stock bank may declare from net profits cash dividends not more frequently than quarterly and non-cash dividends at any time. No dividends may be declared, credited or paid if the bank's capital stock is impaired. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years. Net profits for this purpose means the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets after deducting from the total thereof all current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all federal and state taxes. Regulatory Enforcement Authority. Any Massachusetts bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and directives of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance, including seizure of the property and business of the bank and suspension or revocation of its charter. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may under certain circumstances suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the bank's business in a manner which is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the depositors' interests or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, upon finding that a bank has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the bank concerned. Finally, Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to Danversbank permit private individual and class action law suits and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damage and attorney's fees in the case of certain violations of those statutes. Depositors Insurance Fund. All Massachusetts-chartered savings banks are required to be members of the Depositors Insurance Fund, a corporation that insures savings bank deposits in excess of federal deposit insurance coverage. The Depositors Insurance Fund is authorized to charge savings banks an annual assessment of up to 1/50th of 1.0% of a savings bank's deposit balances in excess of amounts insured by the FDIC. In many cases, Massachusetts has similar statutes to those under federal law that are applicable to Danversbank, certain of which are described below. Federal Bank Regulation Capital Requirements. Federally insured state-chartered savings banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System, or state non-member banks, such as Danversbank, are required to comply with the minimum leverage capital requirements of the FDIC. For an institution determined by the FDIC to not be anticipating or experiencing significant growth and to be, in general, a strong banking organization rated composite 1 under Uniform Financial Institutions Ranking System established by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, the minimum capital leverage requirement is a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of 3.0%. For all other institutions, the minimum leverage capital ratio is not less than 4.0%. Tier 1 capital is the sum of common stockholder's equity, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock (including any related retained earnings) and minority investments in certain subsidiaries, less intangible assets (except for certain servicing rights and credit card relationships) and certain other specified items. The FDIC regulations require state non-member banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital in relation to regulatory risk-weighted assets. The ratio of regulatory capital to regulatory risk-weighted assets is referred to as a bank's "risk-based capital ratio." Risk-based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet items (including recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes and residual interests) to one of five risk-weighted categories ranging from 0.0% to 200.0%, with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk. For example, under the FDIC's risk-weighting system, cash and securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government are given a 0.0% risk weight, loans secured 27 by one- to four-family residential properties generally have a 50.0% risk weight, and commercial loans have a risk weight of 100.0%. State non-member banks must maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, of which at least one-half must be Tier 1 capital. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 or supplementary capital items, which includes allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, cumulative preferred stock and certain other capital instruments, and a portion of the net unrealized gain on equity securities. The includable amount of Tier 2 capital cannot exceed the amount of the institution's Tier 1 capital. Banks that engage in specified levels of trading activities are subject to adjustments in their risk based capital calculation to ensure the maintenance of sufficient capital to support market risk. The FDIC Improvement Act required each federal banking agency to revise its risk-based capital standards for insured institutions to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest-rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and the risk of nontraditional activities, as well as to reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi- family residential loans. The FDIC, along with the other federal banking agencies, has adopted a regulation providing that the agencies will take into account the exposure of a bank's capital and economic value to changes in interest rate risk in assessing a bank's capital adequacy. The FDIC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon determination that an institution's capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of the particular circumstances. As a bank holding company, the Company is also subject to capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies imposed by the Federal Reserve Board, which guidelines are similar to those of the FDIC for state-chartered savings banks. On a consolidated basis, the Company's pro forma stockholders' equity exceeded these requirements as of December 31, 2007. Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit system, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. Most recently, the agencies have established standards for safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. Investment Activities. Since the enactment of the FDIC Improvement Act, all state-chartered FDIC-insured banks, including savings banks, have generally been limited in their investment activities to principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law. The FDIC Improvement Act and the FDIC regulations permit exceptions to these limitations. For example, state chartered banks may, with FDIC approval, continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange or the NASDAQ Global Select Market and in the shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The maximum permissible investment is 100.0% of Tier 1 Capital, as specified by the FDIC's regulations, or the maximum amount permitted by Massachusetts law, whichever is less. Danversbank received approval from the FDIC to retain and acquire such equity instruments equal to the lesser of 100% of Danversbank's Tier 1 capital or the maximum permissible amount specified by Massachusetts law. Any such grandfathered authority may be terminated upon the FDIC's determination that such investments pose a safety and soundness risk or upon the occurrence of certain events such as the savings bank's conversion to a different charter. In 28 addition, the FDIC is authorized to permit such institutions to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 specifies that a non-member bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a "financial subsidiary" if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes. Interstate Banking and Branching. The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, or the Interstate Banking Act, permits adequately capitalized bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state subject to specified concentration limits and other conditions. The Interstate Banking Act also authorizes the interstate merger of banks. In addition, among other things, the Interstate Banking Act permits banks to establish new branches on an interstate basis provided that such action is specifically authorized by the law of the host state. Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take "prompt corrective action" with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. An institution is deemed to be "well capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater. An institution is "adequately capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.0% or greater, and generally a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater. An institution is "undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, or generally a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%. An institution is deemed to be "significantly undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3.0%, or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be "critically undercapitalized" if it has a ratio of tangible equity, as defined in the regulations, to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. "Undercapitalized" banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution, including dividend, and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. A bank's compliance with such a plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution's total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an "undercapitalized" bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is "significantly undercapitalized." "Significantly undercapitalized" banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. "Critically undercapitalized" institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status. At December 31, 2007, Danversbank was deemed a well capitalized institution for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations and as such is not subject to the above mentioned restrictions. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed Danversbank's category. 29 Transaction with Affiliates and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Regulations. Transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies, which are controlled by such parent holding company, are generally affiliates of the bank. Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W (i) limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in "covered transactions" with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of such institution's capital stock and retained earnings, and contain an aggregate limit on "covered transactions" with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of such institution's capital stock and retained earnings and (ii) require that all affiliated transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term "covered transaction" includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and other similar transactions. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the financial institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act amended several provisions of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The amendments provide that so-called "financial subsidiaries" of banks are treated as affiliates for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, but the amendment provides that (i) the 10.0% capital limit on transactions between the bank and such financial subsidiary as an affiliate is not applicable, and (ii) the investment by the bank in the financial subsidiary does not include retained earnings in the financial subsidiary. Certain anti-evasion provisions have been included that relate to the relationship between any financial subsidiary of a bank and sister companies of the bank: (1) any purchase of, or investment in, the securities of a financial subsidiary by any affiliate of the parent bank is considered a purchase or investment by the bank; and (2) if the Federal Reserve Board determines that such treatment is necessary, any loan made by an affiliate of the parent bank to the financial subsidiary is to be considered a loan made by the parent bank. Danversbank has no financial subsidiaries. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by a company to its executive officers and directors. However, the law contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, Danversbank's authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders ("insiders") of The Company and Danversbank, as well as entities such persons control, is limited. The law limits both the individual and aggregate amount of loans Danversbank may make to insiders based, in part, on Danversbank's capital position and requires certain board approval procedures to be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executive officers are further limited by specific categories. In addition, Danversbank must comply with Massachusetts banking laws regarding loans to insiders. See "BusinessRegulation and SupervisionMassachusetts Bank RegulationLoans to a Bank's Insiders" on page 26. Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured state savings banks, including Danversbank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. The FDIC has authority under federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank under limited circumstances. The FDIC is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was "critically undercapitalized" on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which 30 the institution became "critically undercapitalized." The FDIC may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non-member institution under specific circumstances on the basis of the institution's financial condition or upon the occurrence of other events, including: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; and (4) insufficient capital, or the incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution's capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance. FDIC Insurance Premiums. Danversbank pays deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC based on a assessment rate established by the FDIC. In 2006, the FDIC enacted various rules to implement the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the "FDI Reform Act"). Pursuant to the FDI Reform Act, in 2006 the FDIC merged the Bank Insurance Fund with the Savings Association Insurance Fund to create a newly named Deposit Insurance Fund (the "DIF") that covers both banks and savings associations. The FDIC also revised, effective January 1, 2007, the risk-based premium system under which the FDIC classifies institutions based on the factors described below and generally assesses higher rates on those institutions that tend to pose greater risks to the DIF. For most banks, including Danversbank, FDIC rates will depend upon a combination of CAMELS component ratings and financial ratios. CAMELS ratings reflect the applicable bank regulatory agency's evaluation of the financial institution's capital, asset quality, management, earnings liquidity and sensitivity to risk. For large banks and savings associations that have long-term debt issuer ratings, assessment rates will depend upon such ratings, and CAMELS component ratings. For institutions, such as Danversbank, which are in the lowest risk category, assessment rates vary initially from 5 to 7 basis points per $100 of insured deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act ("FDIA"), as amended by the FDI Reform Act, requires the FDIC to set a ratio of deposit insurance reserves to estimated insured depositsthe designated reserve ratio (the "DRR")for a particular year within a range of 1.15% to1.50%. For 2008, the FDIC set the DRR at 1.25%. During 2007, Danversbank paid $120,000 of FDIC insurance premiums. Under the FDI Reform Act, and the FDIC's revised premium program, every FDIC-insured institution pays some level of deposit insurance assessments regardless of the level of the DRR. The one-time assessment credit that Danversbank received will be fully expended by the first quarter of 2008. Danversbank estimates that its 2008 FDIC insurance premiums will be approximately $700,000. The FDIC may terminate insurance of deposits if it finds that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. If an institution becomes undercapitalized, the FDIC will prohibit it from accepting certain employee benefit plan deposits. The management of Danversbank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of Danversbank's deposit insurance. Insured institutions are also required to assist in the repayment of bonds issued by the Financing Corporation in the late 1980s to capitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. Privacy Regulations. Pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the FDIC has published regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The regulations generally require that Danversbank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer's "non-public personal information," to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, Danversbank is required to provide its customers with the ability to "opt-out" of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. Danversbank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations. 31 Customer Information Security. The FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for establishing standards for safeguarding nonpublic personal information about customers that implement provisions of the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act ("Information Security Guidelines"). Among other things, the Information Security Guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information; and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. In 2005, the FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies issued further guidance for the establishment of these Information Security Guidelines, requiring financial institutions to develop and implement response programs designed to address incidents of unauthorized access to sensitive customer information maintained by the financial institution or its service provider, including customer notification procedures. Danversbank currently has Information Security Guidelines in place and believes that such guidelines are in compliance with the guidelines. A majority of states have enacted legislation concerning breaches of data security and Congress is considering federal legislation that would require consumer notice of data security breaches. Identity Theft Red Flags. The federal banking agencies jointly issued final rules and guidelines in November, 2007 implementing section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 ("FACT Act") and final rules implementing section 315 of the FACT Act. The rules implementing section 114 require each financial institution or creditor to develop and implement a written Identity Theft Prevention Program (the "Program") to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of certain accounts or certain existing accounts. In addition, the federal banking agencies issued guidelines to assist financial institutions and creditors in the formulation and maintenance of a Program that satisfies the requirements of the rules. The rules implementing section 114 also require credit and debit card issuers to assess the validity of notifications of changes of address under certain circumstances. Additionally, the federal banking agencies are issuing joint rules under section 315 that provide guidance regarding reasonable policies and procedures that a user of consumer reports must employ when a consumer reporting agency sends the user a notice of address discrepancy. The joint final rules and guidelines became effective on January 1, 2008. The mandatory compliance date for this rule is November 1, 2008. Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, as amended and as implemented by FDIC regulations, a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of an institution's CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. Danversbank's latest FDIC CRA rating was "Outstanding." Massachusetts has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA, which is also applicable to Danversbank. The Massachusetts version is generally similar to the CRA but utilizes a five-tiered descriptive rating system. Massachusetts law requires the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks to consider, but not be limited to, a bank's record of performance under Massachusetts law in considering any application by the bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office 32 or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of banking institution. Danversbank's most recent rating under Massachusetts law was "Outstanding." Consumer Protection and Fair Lending Regulations. Massachusetts savings banks are subject to a variety of federal and Massachusetts statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers 100 and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys' fees for certain types of violations. Anti-Money Laundering Laws. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act, significantly expands the responsibilities of financial institutions, including savings and banks, to assist in the prevention of the use of the U.S. financial system to fund terrorist activities. Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act provides for a significant overhaul of the U.S. anti-money laundering regime. Among other provisions, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act requires financial institutions operating in the United States to develop new anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations. Danversbank and the Company have a program that is designed to meet the requirements of these laws. Other Regulations Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Danversbank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Danversbank's loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help to meet the housing needs of the community it serves; Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; Massachusetts Debt Collection Regulations, establishing standards, by defining unfair or deceptive acts or practices, for the collection of debts from persons within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; General Laws of Massachusetts, Chapter 167E, which governs Danversbank's lending powers; and Rules and regulations of the various federal and state agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal and state laws. The deposit operations of Danversbank also are subject to, among other laws, the: Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 33 Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, as well as Chapter 167B of the General Laws of Massachusetts, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers' rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as "Check 21"), which gives "substitute checks," such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; and General Laws of Massachusetts, Chapter 167D, which governs Danversbank's deposit powers. Federal Reserve System The Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain non-interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for that portion of transaction accounts aggregating $45.8 million or less (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve requirement is 3.0%; and for amounts greater than $45.8 million, the reserve requirement is $1,119,000 plus 10.0% (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board between 8.0% and 14.0%), of the amount in excess of $45.8 million. The first $8.5 million of otherwise reservable balances (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. Danversbank is in compliance with these requirements. Federal Home Loan Bank System Danversbank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, or FHLBB, which is one of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System, or FHLB. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region and is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB. Danversbank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLBB. Danversbank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in stock of the FHLBB at December 31, 2007. The Federal Home Loan Banks are required to provide funds for certain purposes including the resolution of insolvent thrifts in the late 1980s and to contributing funds for affordable housing programs. These requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that the Federal Home Loan Banks pay to their members and result in the Federal Home Loan Banks imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members. If dividends were reduced, or interest on future Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased, a member bank affected by such reduction or increase would likely experience a reduction in its net interest income. Recent legislation has changed the structure of the Federal Home Loan Banks' funding obligations for insolvent thrifts, revised the capital structure of the Federal Home Loan Banks and implemented entirely voluntary membership for Federal Home Loan Banks. There can be no assurance that such dividends will continue in the future. Further, there can be no assurance that the impact of recent or future legislation on the Federal Home Loan Banks also will not cause a decrease in the value of the FHLBB stock held by Danversbank. Holding Company Regulation The Company is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the BHCA, as amended, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval is required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of 34 voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. In addition to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, before any bank acquisition can be completed, prior approval may also be required to be obtained from other agencies having supervisory jurisdiction over the bank to be acquired. A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings and loan association. As noted above, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorizes a BHC that meets specified conditions, including being "well capitalized" and "well managed," to opt to become a FHC and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking. A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company's consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board's policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board's policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default. This law would have potential applicability if the Company ever held as a separate subsidiary a depository institution in addition to Danversbank. The Company and Danversbank will be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of various agencies of the United States Government, including the Federal Reserve System. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, it is impossible for management to accurately predict future changes in monetary policy or the effect of such changes on the business or financial condition of the Company or Danversbank. 35 The status of the Company as a registered bank holding company under the BHCA will not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws. Massachusetts Holding Company Regulation. Under the Massachusetts banking laws, a company owning or controlling two or more banking institutions, including a savings bank, is regulated as a bank holding company. The term "company" is defined by the Massachusetts banking laws similarly to the definition of "company" under the BHCA. Each Massachusetts bank holding company: (i) must obtain the approval of the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation before engaging in certain transactions, such as the acquisition of more than 5% of the voting stock of another banking institution; (ii) must register, and file reports, with the Division; and (iii) is subject to examination by the Division. The Company would become a Massachusetts bank holding company if it acquires a second banking institution and holds and operates it separately from Danversbank. Federal Securities Laws. Our common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We are subject to information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions, and other requirements under the Exchange Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer each is required to certify that the Company's quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal controls; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the Audit Committee of the board of directors about our internal controls; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls. The Company will be subject to further reporting and audit requirements under rules proposed by the SEC. The Company will prepare policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations to ensure compliance with these regulations. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS Our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences, including those described below. You should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements on page 3. Our Commercial Real Estate and Commercial and Industrial, or C&I, Loans May Expose Us to Increased Credit Risks, and These Risks Will Increase if We Succeed in Increasing These Types of Loans. Commercial real estate and C&I loans represent a significant portion of our loan portfolio. Our goal is to increase the level of our permanent commercial real estate and C&I loan segments as a proportion of our portfolio over the next several years. In general, commercial real estate loans and C&I loans generate higher returns, but also pose greater credit risks, than owner occupied residential mortgage loans. As our various commercial loan portfolios increase, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase. The repayment of commercial real estate loans depends on the business and financial condition of borrowers, and a number of our borrowers have more than one commercial real estate loan outstanding with us. Further, these loans are concentrated primarily in Eastern Massachusetts. 36 Economic events and changes in government regulations, which we and our borrowers cannot control or reliably predict, could have an adverse impact on the cash flows generated by properties securing our commercial real estate loans and on the values of the properties securing those loans. We make both secured and, to a lesser extent, unsecured C&I loans. Repayment of both secured and unsecured C&I loans depends substantially on the borrowers' underlying business, financial condition and cash flows. Unsecured loans generally involve a higher degree of risk of loss than secured loans because, without collateral, repayment is wholly dependent upon the success of the borrowers' businesses. Secured C&I loans are generally collateralized by equipment, leases, inventory, accounts receivable and other fixed assets. Compared to real estate, that type of collateral is more difficult to monitor, its value is harder to ascertain, it may depreciate more rapidly and it may not be as readily saleable if repossessed. Also, we expect to increase substantially our internal loans-to-one-borrower limit based on our larger capital base as a result of our recently completed offering. Although we do not expect to increase our internal loans-to-one-borrower limit up to the regulatory maximum in the near future, the increased internal limit may expose us to greater risk of loss. Our Focus on Construction Lending Could Expose Us to Risks Not Associated With Other Types of Lending. We originate construction loans for one- to four-family homes, residential condominiums, commercial, multi-family and other non-residential purposes. Construction and land development loans carry higher levels of risk compared to other types of lending, predicated on whether the project can be completed on-time and on-budget and, for non-owner occupied projects, whether our customer can find tenants at rents that will service the debt or buyers that will pay the appraised value for the completed project. Construction loans are typically based upon estimates of costs to complete the project and an appraised value associated with the completed project. Cost estimates and completed appraised values are subject to changes in the market, and these values may change between the time a loan is approved and the project is completed. Delays or cost overruns in completing a project may arise from labor problems, material shortages and other unpredicted contingencies. If actual construction costs exceed budget, our borrowers may have to put more capital into their projects, or we may have to increase the loan amount to ensure the project is completed, potentially resulting in a higher loan-to-value ratio than anticipated. Where a non-owner occupied project is not pre-leased, changes in the market could result in a slow lease-up period or rents below the levels anticipated. For residential land development or construction loans for residential properties that have not been pre-sold, a general slowdown in home buying could result in slow sales and reduced prices. Either situation will strain our borrowers' cash flows and potentially cause deterioration in this segment of our portfolio. The current slowdown in the sales of single-family and residential condominiums, and the related reduction in prices, has affected construction lending activities in our market area, and we expect that these conditions will have the effect of extending the durations of our construction loans and increasing the risk of possible loss on these loans. Our Continuing Concentration of Loans in Our Primary Market Area May Increase Our Risk. Our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions, including growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts, in the counties in which we conduct business. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are unfavorable, our business may be adversely affected. Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in Essex, Middlesex and, to a lesser extent, Suffolk Counties, in Eastern Massachusetts. The local economic conditions in our market area have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. Tenant occupancy rates for commercial real 37 estate and for residential properties have been increasing in our market area. In addition, rental rates for both types of properties, particularly commercial, have also been increasing. A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, a decline in real estate values, or other factors beyond our control would affect these local economic conditions and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. A Decline in Local Real Estate Values Could Reduce Our Profits. Nearly all of our real estate loans are secured by real estate in Essex and Middlesex Counties. As a result of this concentration, a downturn in the local economy could cause significant increases in non-performing loans, which would reduce our profits. Additionally, a decrease in asset quality could require additions to our allowance for loan losses, which would reduce our profits. A decline in real estate values could cause some of our mortgage loans to become inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss. In addition, because we have a significant amount of commercial real estate loans, decreases in tenant occupancy may also have a negative effect on the ability of many of our borrowers to make timely repayments on their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings. For a discussion of our market area, see "BusinessMarket Area and Competition" on page 5. If Our Allowance For Loan Losses is Not Sufficient to Cover Actual Loan Losses, Our Earnings Could Decrease. In the event that our loan customers do not repay their loans according to the terms of the loans, and the collateral securing the repayment of these loans is insufficient to cover any remaining loan balance, we could experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets, if any, serving as collateral for the repayment of our loans. In determining the amount of our allowance for loan losses, we rely on our loan quality reviews, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which may require additions to our allowance. Although we are unaware of any specific problems with our loan portfolio that would require any increase in our allowance at the present time, it may need to be increased in the future due to adverse developments affecting our construction loans or our emphasis on loan growth and on increasing our portfolio of C&I and commercial real estate loans. Any material additions to our allowance for loan losses would materially decrease our net income. Our business strategy calls for continued growth of commercial real estate loans and C&I loans. These loans typically expose us to greater risk than one- to four-family owner-occupied residential real estate loans. As we further increase the amount of these loans in our loan portfolio, we may increase our provisions for loan losses, which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provisions for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Changes in Market Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Our profitability, like that of most community banks, depends to a large extent upon our net interest income, which is the difference, or spread, between our gross interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Accordingly, our results of operations and financial condition depend 38 largely on movements in market interest rates and our ability to manage our interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities in response to these movements. We are also subject to reinvestment risk relating to interest rate movements. Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are not able to reinvest funds from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on the prepaid loans or securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans. Changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets, including, in particular, the value of our investment securities portfolio, which is comprised mainly of debt securities. Generally, the value of debt securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of retained earnings, net of related taxes. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale therefore would have an adverse affect on our stockholders' equity. See "BusinessInvestment Activities" on page 19. We May Have Difficulty Meeting Our Branch Expansion Goals, and Our Branch Expansion Strategy May Not Be Accretive to Earnings. Our growth plans include the opening of new branch offices in communities within our market area, as well as in other communities contiguous to those we currently serve. Our ability to establish new branches will depend on whether we can identify suitable sites and negotiate acceptable lease or purchase and sale terms. However, we may not be able to do so, and identifying suitable sites and negotiating acceptable terms may be more expensive, or take longer, than we expect. Moreover, once we establish a new branch, numerous factors will contribute to its performance, such as a suitable location, qualified personnel and an effective marketing strategy. Additionally, it takes time for a new branch to gather significant loans and deposits to generate enough income to offset its expenses, some of which, like salaries and occupancy expense, are relatively fixed costs. There can be no assurance that our branch expansion strategy will be accretive to our earnings within a reasonable period of time. Our Ability to Diversify Our Sources of Non-Interest Income May Be Limited if We Cannot Make Acquisitions. We will continue to seek to increase non-interest income through the acquisition of non-banking businesses such as insurance and investment management businesses if opportunities arise. Our ability to grow through selective acquisitions of these businesses will depend on successfully identifying, acquiring and integrating them. We compete with other financial institutions and acquirers with respect to potential acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates or make acquisitions on favorable terms. In addition, we cannot assure you that we can successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our organization in a timely or efficient manner, that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or that we can achieve anticipated operating efficiencies. In the event that we make any acquisitions, we will be presented with many risks that could have a materially negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Any business that we acquire may be engaged in a business that is less familiar to us or have unknown asset quality issues or unknown or contingent liabilities that we did not discover or fully recognize in the due diligence process, thereby resulting in unanticipated losses. The acquisition of other businesses typically requires the integration of different corporate cultures, loan, deposit and other products, pricing strategies, data processing systems and other technologies, accounting, internal audit and financial reporting systems, operational processes, policies, procedures and internal controls, marketing programs and personnel of the acquired business in order to make the transaction economically advantageous. The integration 39 process is complicated and time consuming, and could divert our attention from other business concerns and be disruptive to our customers and the customers of the acquired business. Our failure to successfully integrate an acquired business could result in the loss of key customers and employees, and prevent us from achieving expected synergies and cost savings. Acquisitions also result in expenses that could adversely affect our earnings, and in goodwill that could become impaired, requiring us to recognize further charges. We may finance acquisitions with borrowed funds, thereby increasing our leverage and reducing our liquidity, or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. Our Business Depends Upon Key Employees, and if We Are Unable to Retain the Services of These Key Employees or to Attract and Retain Additional Qualified Personnel, Our Business May Suffer. We are substantially dependent on a number of key employees, including our executive officers. Our success has been, and will continue to be, dependent on our ability to retain the services of our existing key employees and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. The loss of the services of any one of our key employees, or the inability to identify, hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could adversely affect the quality and profitability of our business operations. In particular, the loss of key commercial loan officers, or the failure to attract and hire additional loan officers to expand our commercial real estate and C&I lending programs could have a material adverse effect on our business strategy. In connection with the conversion, we have entered into employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Lending Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer in January 2008. Strong Competition Within Our Market Area May Limit Our Growth and Profitability. We face significant competition both in attracting deposits and in the origination of loans. See "BusinessMarket Area and Competition" on page 5. Savings banks, credit unions, co-operative banks, savings and loan associations and commercial banks operating in our primary market area have historically provided most of our competition for deposits. In addition, and particularly in times of high interest rates, we face additional and significant competition for funds from money-market mutual funds and issuers of corporate and government securities. Competition for the origination of real estate and other loans comes from other thrift institutions, commercial banks, insurance companies, finance companies, other institutional lenders and mortgage companies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have as a community bank. Finally, credit unions do not pay federal or state income taxes and are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than savings banks and as a result, they may enjoy a competitive advantage over us. This advantage places significant competitive pressure on the prices of our loans and deposits. We Continually Encounter Technological Change, and We May Have Fewer Resources Than Many of Our Larger Competitors to Continue to Invest in Technological Improvements. The financial services industry is constantly undergoing technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Failures, interruptions or breaches in security of either of these systems could cause failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposits, servicing or loan origination systems. The 40 occurrence of any of these failures or disruptions could result in monetary losses or a loss of customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We Operate in a Highly Regulated Environment and May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in Law and Regulations. We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination. See "BusinessRegulation and Supervision" on page 25. This regulation and supervision limits the activities in which we may engage. Any change in the laws or regulations applicable to us, or in banking regulators' supervisory policies or examination procedures, particularly any changes relating to commercial real estate lending, C&I lending or other key components of our business, whether by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, other state or federal regulators, the United States Congress or the Massachusetts legislature, or our failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as our expansion plans. We are subject to regulations promulgated by the Massachusetts Division of Banks, as the chartering authority for Danversbank, and by the FDIC as the insurer of deposits up to certain limits. We also belong to the Federal Home Loan Bank System, or FHLB, and as a member of such system we are subject to certain limited regulations promulgated by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, or FHLBB. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board will continue to regulate Danvers Bancorp as a bank holding company. Our business strategy could also be significantly impacted by Title III of The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act, which significantly expanded the responsibilities of financial institutions, including savings banks, in preventing the use of the United States financial system to fund terrorist activities. Among other provisions, the USA PATRIOT Act requires savings banks operating in the United States to develop new anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. These required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations. The purpose of regulation and supervision is primarily to protect our depositors and borrowers and, in the case of FDIC regulation, the FDIC's insurance fund. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in the exercise of their supervisory and enforcement powers. They may, among other things, impose restrictions on the operation of a banking institution, the classification of assets by such institution and such institution's allowance for loan losses. Regulatory and law enforcement authorities also have wide discretion and extensive enforcement powers under various consumer protection and civil rights laws, including the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Massachusetts's deceptive acts and practices law. These laws also permit private individual and class action lawsuits and provide for the recovery of attorneys fees in certain instances. No assurance can be given that the foregoing regulations and supervision will not change so as to affect us adversely. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. 41
