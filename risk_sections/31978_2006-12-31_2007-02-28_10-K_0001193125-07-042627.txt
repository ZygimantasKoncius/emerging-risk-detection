Item 1A. Risk Factors Like other companies in our industry, our consolidated financial results will be impacted by weather, the economy of our service territory, market prices for power, fuel prices, the performance of our customers and the decisions of regulatory agencies. Our common stock price and creditworthiness will be affected by national and international macroeconomic trends, general market conditions and the expectations of the investment community, all of which are largely beyond our control. In addition, the following statements highlight risk factors that may affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. These are not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all such risks, and the statements below must be read together with factors discussed elsewhere in this document and in our other filings with the SEC. Our Costs Could Increase or We Could Experience Reduced Revenues if There are Problems at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station A significant percentage of our generating capacity, off-system sales margins, assets and operating expenses is attributable to Palo Verde. Our 15.8% interest in each of the three Palo Verde units totals approximately 622 MW of generating capacity. Palo Verde represents approximately 40% of our available net generating capacity and represented approximately 42% of our available energy for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. Palo Verde comprises 43% of our total net plant-in-service and Palo Verde expenses comprise a significant portion of operation and maintenance expenses. APS is the operating agent for Palo Verde and we have limited ability under the ANPP Participation Agreement to influence operations and costs at Palo Verde. The NRC recently placed Palo Verde in the multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column of its action matrix which we expect will result in an enhanced NRC oversight and inspection regimen. We face the risk of additional or unanticipated costs at Palo Verde resulting from (i) increases in operation and maintenance expenses, including additional costs relating to the enhanced NRC oversight; (ii) the replacement of steam generators in Palo Verde Unit 3; (iii) the replacement of reactor vessel heads at the Palo Verde units; (iv) an extended outage of any of the Palo Verde units; (v) increases in estimates of decommissioning costs; (vi) the storage of radioactive waste, including spent nuclear fuel; (vii) prolonged reductions in generating output; (viii) insolvency of other Palo Verde Participants; and (ix) compliance with the various requirements and regulations governing commercial nuclear generating stations. At the same time, our retail base rates in Texas are effectively capped through June 2010. As a result, we cannot seek approval to increase our base rates in Texas in the event of increases in non-fuel costs or loss of revenue unless our return on equity falls below the bottom of a defined range which currently is approximately 8.3%. Our rates in New Mexico will be fixed until after the conclusion of the May 2009 rate filing, if the 2007 New Mexico Stipulation is approved by the NMPRC. We cannot assure that revenues will be sufficient to recover any increased costs, including any increased costs in connection with Palo Verde or other operations, whether as a result of inflation, changes in tax laws or regulatory requirements, or other causes. We May Not Be Able to Pass Through All of Our Fuel Expenses to Customers In general, by law, we are entitled to pass through our prudently incurred fuel and purchased power expenses to our customers in Texas and New Mexico. We agreed as part of the 2004 New Mexico Stipulation to a fixed price for fuel and purchased power expenses for 10 percent of the kilowatt-hours for retail sales in New Mexico pursuant to a base rate agreement that expires in 2007. 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements This agreement also allows us to price a portion of power from Palo Verde Unit 3 at prices which partially track gas prices. To the extent that this indirect hedge does not perfectly track our costs, we are subject to the risk of increased costs of fuel and purchased power costs that would not be recoverable. The portion of fuel expense that is not fixed in New Mexico and all of Texas fuel expense is subject to reconciliation by the Texas Commission and the NMPRC. Prior to the completion of a reconciliation, we record fuel and purchased power costs transactions such that fuel revenues equal fuel and purchased power expense except for the portion fixed in New Mexico and the repriced fuel costs for Palo Verde Unit 3. In the event that a disallowance occurs during a reconciliation proceeding, the amounts recorded for fuel and purchased power expenses could differ from the amounts we are allowed to collect from our customers and we would incur a loss to the extent of the disallowance. In New Mexico, the FPPCAC allows us to reflect current fuel and purchased power expenses in the FPPCAC and to adjust for under-recoveries and over-recoveries with a two-month lag. In Texas, fuel costs are recovered through a fixed fuel factor that may be adjusted two times per year. If we materially under-recover fuel costs, we may seek a surcharge to recover those costs at the time of the next fuel factor filing. During periods of significant increases in natural gas prices such as occurred in 2004 and 2005, the Company realizes a lag in the ability to reflect increases in fuel costs in its fuel recovery mechanisms. As a result, cash flow is impacted due to the lag in payment of fuel costs and collection of fuel costs from customers. At December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the Company had deferred fuel balances of $32.6 million and $92.3 million, respectively. A surcharge to collect fuel under-recoveries of $53 million over a 24-month period was placed into effect in Texas in October 2005. A second surcharge was placed into effect on an interim basis in Texas in February 2006 to collect $34 million over a twelve-month period. To the extent the fuel and purchased power recovery processes in Texas and New Mexico do not provide for the timely recovery of such costs, we could experience a material negative impact on our cash flow. Equipment Failures and Other External Factors Can Adversely Affect Our Results The generation and transmission of electricity require the use of expensive and complex equipment. While we have a maintenance program in place, generating plants are subject to unplanned outages because of equipment failure. We are particularly vulnerable to this due to the advanced age of several of our gas-fired generating units in or near El Paso. In addition, we are seeking to extend the lives of these plants. In the event of unplanned outages, we must acquire power from others at unpredictable costs in order to supply our customers and comply with our contractual agreements. This can materially increase our costs and prevent us from selling excess power at wholesale, thus reducing our profits. In addition, actions of other utilities may adversely affect our ability to use transmission lines to deliver or import power, thus subjecting us to unexpected expenses or to the cost and uncertainty of public policy initiatives. We are particularly vulnerable to this because a significant portion of our available energy (at Palo Verde and Four Corners) is located hundreds of miles from El Paso and Las Cruces and must be delivered to our customers over long distance transmission lines. In addition, Palo Verdes availability is an important factor in realizing off-system sales margins. These factors, as well as weather, interest rates, economic conditions, fuel prices and price volatility, are largely beyond our control, but may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated earnings, cash flows and financial position. 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Potential for Strike or Lock Out Due to Union Employees Working Without a Contract We have historically had a union workforce of approximately 300 employees. In 2003 and 2004, 136 additional employees, from the meter reading, collections, facilities services, and customer service areas, voted to join the union. The union contract for the historical group of 300 union employees expired on June 30, 2006, and currently all 436 union employees are working without a contract. We have been engaged in negotiations with the union trying to achieve a contract for all the union employees. While we will continue our effort to reach agreement on the terms of a new contract with all union employees, these employees could strike or we could lock them out. If a strike or lock out occurs, we will implement a work continuation plan. However, we may experience a reduction in the reliability of our service and may incur added expense to hire replacement workers, train and equip non-union employees, and provide security for our facilities. Competition and Deregulation Could Result in a Loss of Customers and Increased Costs As a result of changes in federal law, our wholesale and large retail customers already have, in varying degrees, alternate sources of power, including co-generation of electric power. Deregulation legislation is in effect in Texas requiring us to separate our transmission and distribution functions, which would remain regulated, from our power generation and energy services businesses, which would operate in a competitive market, in the future. On October 13, 2004, the Texas Commission approved a rule delaying retail competition in our Texas service territory. This rule identified various milestones that we must reach before retail competition can begin. The first milestone calls for the development, approval by the FERC, and commencement of independent operation of an RTO in the area that includes our service territory. This and other milestones are not likely to be achieved for a number of years. There is substantial uncertainty about both the regulatory framework and market conditions that would exist if and when retail competition is implemented in our Texas service territory, and we may incur substantial preparatory, restructuring and other costs that may not ultimately be recoverable. There can be no assurance that deregulation would not adversely affect our future operations, cash flows and financial condition. Item 1B.
