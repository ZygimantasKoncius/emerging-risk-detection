Item 1A. Risk FactorsYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating SHO and our common stock. The following risk factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.Risks Relating to Our Relationship with, and Dependence on, Sears HoldingsWe depend on Sears Holdings to provide us with most key products and services for our business. Consequently, if Sears Holdings is unwilling, unable, or otherwise fails to perform these services adequately, or at all, or if Sears Holdings’ brands are impaired, we could be materially and adversely affected.We rely heavily on the products and services provided by Sears Holdings or its subsidiaries (the “key products and services”) including the following:•Inventory procurement from third-party vendors, including KCD Products and other products which collectively account for a majority of our revenue;•Logistical, supply chain and inventory support services;•Accounting and financial reporting services;•Environmental and safety program, risk management, tax, and insurance services;•Online, computer and information technology infrastructure (including the point-of-sale system used by the Company and its dealers and franchisees) and support;•Payroll and certain employee-related services;•Our websites are hosted and maintained by a subsidiary of Sears Holdings and purchases made on our websites are processed by a subsidiary of Sears Holdings;•Certain of our store leases and the leases for stores that we have subleased, or in the future may sublease, to franchisees or others are leased or subleased to us by subsidiaries of Sears Holdings until their expiration at which time we will be required to renegotiate with the landlords directly;•Our stores continue to use the Sears brand name, and other intellectual property owned by Sears Holdings through our license agreements with Sears Holdings;•Our stores continue to participate in the SYW program and rely on the customer data and other information provided by the SYW program; and•Our stores continue to accept Sears-branded credit cards.As a result of our dependence on Sears Holdings, we are exposed to the risk that Sears Holdings will become unable or unwilling to fulfill its contractual obligations to us in accordance with their terms. Sears Holdings is subject to various risks and uncertainties, which could in turn adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such risks include (1) risks related to the retail industry, (2) risks related to worldwide economic conditions, (3) risks associated with its computer systems, and (4) risks related to Sears Holdings' ability to access capital markets and other financing sources.We believe it is necessary for Sears Holdings to provide the key products and services to us to facilitate the continued operation of our business. However, Sears Holdings has no obligation to provide assistance to us other than the products and services to be provided pursuant to our agreements with Sears Holdings. Although Sears Holdings is generally obligated to provide us with these products and services until at least 2018, these products and services may not be provided at the same level or at the same prices during the entire duration of the agreements, and we may not be able to obtain the same benefits from these products and services. Generally, we expect to need to rely on Sears Holdings for most of these products and services for the entire term of the applicable agreement. In addition, to the extent that our growth depends on expanding the number of stores we operate, we may need to rely on Sears Holdings to supply the same products and services in new regions, trade areas, and store formats. When Sears Holdings is no longer obligated to provide these products and services to us, we may not be able to replace these products and services on terms and conditions, including costs, as favorable as those we have with Sears Holdings. See "Certain Relationships and Transactions" in the 2014 Proxy Statement, which is incorporated by reference into Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 8The service fees we are obligated to pay under the Services Agreement are not firm for the entire 66-month duration of the Services Agreement and higher service fees could result.The Services Agreement provides that it will expire on April 30, 2018 unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms. The Services Agreement also provides that we may terminate an individual service at the end of any fiscal month upon 60-days’ prior written notice. The Services Agreement also provides that (1) we will pay the service fees specified in the Services Agreement for three years commencing on October 12, 2012 and (2) SHMC and we will negotiate in good faith the service fees for the fourth and fifth years of the term and the sixth-month period following the fifth year (together, the “remaining term”) for those services that we do not terminate prior to the remaining term (the “continuing services”). The Services Agreement does not expressly provide for the service fees that we would be obligated to pay during the remaining term if as a result of good-faith negotiations SHMC and we were unable to agree upon one or more of the service fees to be negotiated, but if that occurs SHMC is entitled to terminate the applicable continuing service or continuing services on 60-days’ prior written notice. The negotiations with respect to the service fees for the continuing services could result in our agreement to pay service fees for the continuing services during the remaining term that are higher than the service fees that we are currently paying, which result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We depend on existing agreements with Sears Holdings and manufacturers to provide our inventory.Our Hometown and Outlet businesses rely on Sears Holdings (or its subsidiaries) for a significant portion of their inventory, including KCD Products. For the year ended February 1, 2014, products which we acquired through Sears Holdings accounted for approximately 84% of our merchandise purchases. Hometown merchandise purchases are sourced predominantly through Sears Holdings. If we are unable to obtain adequate amounts and assortments of merchandise from Sears Holdings, we may be unable to find alternative sources of supply on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, the third-party vendors from whom Sears Holdings currently obtains merchandise for us may not be willing to continue to sell merchandise to Sears Holdings on commercially reasonable terms and may insist that we purchase from the third-party vendors on terms that are less favorable than the terms enjoyed by Sears Holdings. If we are unable to maintain a broad selection of merchandise for sale to our customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.In addition, our Outlet business also relies on suppliers other than Sears Holdings for a significant portion of its inventory. For the year ended February 1, 2014, purchases with these outside sources accounted for approximately 59% of total Outlet purchases. We depend on our ability to continue to obtain inventory, including appliances, from these and other manufacturers in the future. Our agreements with these manufacturers do not guarantee the availability of a certain amount of merchandise at any given time, and we have no assurance that any of these agreements will be renewed on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If these manufacturers decrease their output of merchandise, raise their prices, or find alternative distribution channels for their products, or all of these, and we are required to find one or more alternative suppliers, we may not be able to contract with them on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The lack of alternative suppliers could lead to higher prices, decreased inventory, or an inability to maintain an appropriate assortment of merchandise in our stores and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price. In addition, if we do not maintain our existing relationships or build new relationships with manufacturers, we may not be able to maintain an appropriate assortment of merchandise, and customers may not purchase from our stores.We rely on Sears Holdings and other third parties to provide us with key products and services in connection with the administration of many critical aspects of our business and we may be required to develop our own systems quickly and cost-effectively in order to reduce such dependence.We are party to various agreements with Sears Holdings (including without limitation the Services Agreement), as well as with third-party service providers, to provide processing and administrative functions over a broad range of areas, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Key products and services provided by Sears Holdings or other third parties as a part of outsourcing initiatives could be interrupted as a result of many factors, such as acts of God or contract disputes, and any failure by third parties to provide us with these key products and services on a timely basis or within our service level expectations and performance standards could result in a disruption to our business.We rely heavily on the infrastructure of Sears Holdings for a variety of key products and services. Our various agreements with Sears Holdings (including without limitation the Services Agreement and the Merchandising Agreement), which govern the provision of these key products and services, generally have initial terms of at least five and a half years from the effective dates of the agreements, and we may seek to continue to rely on the infrastructure of Sears Holdings after the initial terms of these agreements expire. Our business plans depend to a significant extent on Sears Holdings’ willingness and ability to continue to provide us with these key products and services. Any failure to maintain Sears Holdings as a service provider, or any actions by 9Sears Holdings, when permitted under the applicable agreement, to raise the prices it charges us for these key products and services, could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.In addition, disruptions in the computer and communications hardware and software systems provided by Sears Holdings could harm our ability to run our business, result in the compromise of confidential customer data, lead to costly litigation, and damage our reputation with our customers. Any material interruption in our computer operations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. As a result of our reliance on the computer and information technology infrastructure of Sears Holdings, we have limited control over the timing and implementation of upgrades to our computer and information technology systems that we may believe are integral to the successful operation of our business.If our relationships with our vendors, including Sears Holdings, were to be impaired, it could have a negative impact on our competitive position and our business and financial performance.We obtain our merchandise from Sears Holdings and other vendors. For the year ended February 1, 2014, products which we acquired from Sears Holdings, including KCD Products and other products, accounted for approximately 84% of our total purchases of inventory from all vendors. The loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by Sears Holdings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Pursuant to the Merchandising Agreement, subsidiaries of Sears Holdings have agreed to obtain for us Sears brand products, including KCD Products, until 2018 subject to two three-year renewal terms with respect to KCD Products, certain termination rights, and other specified conditions. However, we may need to rely on Sears Holdings for our inventory beyond 2018 or, if the Merchandising Agreement is renewed for both renewal terms, 2024. If we are unable to extend, or renegotiate on comparable terms, the Merchandising Agreement beyond 2018 or, if the Merchandising Agreement is renewed for both renewal terms, 2024, we may not be able to replace the inventory provided under the Merchandising Agreement on commercially reasonable terms, or at all and any such inability could have a material adverse effect on our prospects and results of operations and our ability to operate our business could be significantly impaired, as we would have to find new sources for our inventory.In addition, our vendor arrangements generally are not long-term agreements (other than the Merchandising Agreement) and none of them guarantee the availability of merchandise in the future. Our growth strategy depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with sufficient inventory. As a result, our success depends on maintaining good relations with our existing vendors and developing relationships with new vendors. If we fail to maintain our relations with our existing vendors or the quality and quantity of merchandise they supply us, or if we cannot acquire new vendors of favored brand-name merchandise, our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise at acceptable prices may be limited, which would have a negative impact on our competitive position. In addition, to the extent we are able to develop relationships with new vendors and obtain merchandise from alternative sources, the merchandise obtained may be of a lesser quality and more expensive than the merchandise we currently purchase.We rely on Sears Holdings for services related to our online business and the processing of online orders.Our Hometown and Outlet businesses’ websites are managed by a subsidiary of Sears Holdings and we pay certain hosting and maintenance fees to Sears Holdings for the management of such websites. In addition, online orders placed on our Hometown business’ websites are processed by, and subject to a processing fee to be paid to, a subsidiary of Sears Holdings.In addition, many of the products we sell are available through websites owned and operated by Sears Holdings. As a result, online orders placed through websites owned and operated by Sears Holdings may take business share from our businesses without any commission or other benefit to us. Increasing purchases of home appliances and other products that our stores sell through online channels could adversely affect our results of operations.We license from Sears Holdings the use of our store names, domain names and certain trademarks used to brand our products.We license from Sears Holdings the use of the Sears trademark, the KCD Marks, and the “Sears Hometown Store,” "Sears Authorized Hometown Store," “Sears Hardware Store,” “Sears Home Appliance Showroom,” "Sears Appliance & Hardware," and “Sears Outlet” store names (collectively, the “store names”) and certain of our website domain names (the “domain names”). Pursuant to the Merchandising Agreement, our license to use the KCD Marks will expire in 2018 or, if renewed for both renewal terms, 2024, and pursuant to the Store License Agreements and Trademark License Agreement, our licenses to use the Sears trademark, the store names and the domain names will expire in 2029, subject to specified termination rights.If the value of the Sears trademark, the KCD Marks, the store names or the domain names diminishes, or if we are unable to extend, renew, or renegotiate the Merchandising Agreement, the Store License Agreements or the Trademark License Agreement on comparable terms, or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our prospects and results of operations and our ability to 10operate our business could be significantly impaired, as it would require us to stop using one or more of the aforementioned names in both our stores and our product advertising.Certain of our agreements with subsidiaries of Sears Holdings contain early termination provisions that are outside of our control and, if triggered, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and our financial performance.Our agreements with subsidiaries of Sears Holdings contain various default and termination provisions, some of which are not within our control. For example, under the Merchandising Agreement, if (i) an unaffiliated third party acquires all rights, title, and interest in and to one or more (but not all) of the KCD Marks, then subsidiaries of Sears Holdings may terminate their obligation to sell to us the products that are branded with the KCD Marks that were subject to such acquisition and (ii) if an unaffiliated third party acquires all rights, title, and interest in and to all of the KCD Marks, then subsidiaries of Sears Holdings may terminate the Merchandising Agreement in its entirety. Furthermore, the agreements with subsidiaries of Sears Holdings may also be terminated by either party upon a material breach if the breaching party fails to cure such breach within 30 days following written notice of such breach or, if such breach is not curable, immediately upon delivery of notice of the non-breaching party’s intention to terminate.In addition, a number of our agreements with subsidiaries of Sears Holdings contain cross-termination provisions such that, if a breach of or default under one of the agreements by one party were to result in the termination of such agreement, the other party may terminate a number of the additional agreements between the parties. If one or more of our agreements with subsidiaries of Sears Holdings were to be terminated earlier than currently anticipated, it could have a material adverse effect on our prospects and results of operations and our ability to operate our business would be significantly impaired. For additional information see "Certain Relationships and Transactions" in the 2014 Proxy Statement, which is incorporated by reference into Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The sale of KCD Products to other retailers, including certain of our competitors, may adversely affect our results of operations.KCD Products accounted for approximately 56% of our consolidated revenue during fiscal year 2013. Sears Holdings has agreed to supply certain other retailers, including certain of our competitors, with a number of Craftsman- and DieHard-branded products that previously were only sold through affiliates of Sears Holdings. If Sears Holdings continues to supply other retailers, including our competitors, with Craftsman- and DieHard-branded products, or begins to supply other retailers with Kenmore-branded products, our revenue may be adversely affected.Our non-competition agreements with Sears Holdings restrict our ability to expand into certain geographic areas.Currently, Sears full-line stores, Kmart stores, and certain specialty retail stores owned by Sears Holdings sell product lines that are similar to ours. The Merchandising Agreement prohibits us, subject to specified conditions, from opening new Hometown Stores and Hardware Stores and from selling new merchandise in new Outlet Stores, each in specified areas. These non-competition obligations will restrict our ability to open new stores and sell certain types of products in the specified areas that we might otherwise consider as possible targets for expansion and may limit our growth potential. Our pre-Separation historical combined financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved either as a single combined business entity or as a publicly traded company separate from Sears Holdings and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.The pre-Separation historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not reflect what our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows would have been had we been (1) operated as a single combined business entity by Sears Holdings during the periods presented or (2) a publicly traded company separate from Sears Holdings during the periods presented, or what our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows will be in the future as we operate as a single consolidated business entity separate from Sears Holdings. This is primarily because of the following:•Our pre-Separation historical financial information reflects the results of operations, financial positions, and cash flows of Sears Hometown and Hardware and Sears Outlet prior to their consolidation into SHO, which may not reflect the results of operations, financial positions, and cash flows of SHO as a single combined business entity;•Our pre-Separation historical financial information does not reflect changes resulting from the integration of Sears Hometown and Hardware and Sears Outlet into a single combined entity, including changes in the cost structure, personnel needs, financing, and operation of our business;•Our pre-Separation historical financial information reflects assumptions made by Sears Holdings and allocations for certain services and expenses historically provided to us by Sears Holdings. Those assumptions and allocations may not reflect the costs and expenses we would have incurred or will incur as a separate company; and11•Our pre-Separation historical financial information does not reflect changes resulting from the Separation, including changes in the cost structure, personnel needs, financing, and operations of our business.Since the Separation, we have been responsible for the additional costs associated with being a publicly traded company separate from Sears Holdings, including costs related to corporate governance and SEC reporting requirements. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our historical financial information presented herein will be indicative of our future results.For additional information about our past financial performance and the basis of presentation of our financial statements, see “Selected Historical Financial and Other Data,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.As a publicly traded company separate from Sears Holdings, we may experience increased costs resulting from a decrease in the purchasing power we enjoyed pre-Separation.Prior to the Separation, we were able to take advantage of Sears Holdings’ size and purchasing power in procuring services, including advertising, shipping and receiving, logistics, store maintenance contracts, employee benefit support, insurance, credit and debit card interchange fees and other services. Following the Separation, we are a smaller company than Sears Holdings and we may not have access to financial and other resources comparable to those available to us prior to the Separation. Although we plan to leverage our ongoing relationship with Sears Holdings in order to obtain similar benefits in purchasing power, we may be unable to obtain goods, technology and services at prices and on terms as favorable as those available to us prior to the Separation, which could increase our costs and reduce our profitability.We may have been able to receive better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we received in our agreements with Sears Holdings.The agreements related to the Separation, including the Services Agreement, the Store License Agreements, the Trademark License Agreement, the Merchandising Agreement, and the Retail Establishment Agreement, were agreed to in the context of a parent-subsidiary relationship and in the overall context of the Separation. Accordingly, they may not represent the best terms that could have been available to us from third parties. The terms of the agreements negotiated in the context of the Separation relate to, among other things, the principal actions needed to be taken in connection with the Separation, indemnification and other obligations among Sears Holdings and us, and the nature of the commercial arrangements between us and Sears Holdings following the Separation. For additional information see "Certain Relationships and Transactions" in the 2014 Proxy Statement, which is incorporated by reference into Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may not be able to resolve successfully existing and, if they arise, future contractual disputes and other conflicts with Sears Holdings. Several of our material agreements with Sears Holdings, such as the Services Agreement, the Store License Agreements, the Trademark License Agreement, and the Merchandising Agreement, were agreed to in the context of a parent-subsidiary relationship and in the overall context of the Separation. Since the Separation a number of disputes have arisen with respect to these agreements. We have entered into amendments and other agreements with Sears Holdings that we believe have resolved some, but not all, of these disputes. We may be unable to resolve existing and, if they arise, future disputes on commercially reasonable terms, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Future disputes could arise with respect to the following matters, among others:•availability and allocation of merchandise and subsidies from Sears Holdings and from third-party suppliers;•business opportunities that may be attractive to both Sears Holdings and us;•the nature, quality and pricing of services Sears Holdings has agreed to provide to us;•labor, tax, employee benefit, real estate (including sublease obligations) and other matters arising from the Separation;•defense and indemnification arising from losses caused by Sears Holdings;•major business combinations involving us;•employee retention and recruiting;•SHO's intellectual property rights;•the extent of SHO's rights to conduct multi-channel retailing; and•competition between our stores and websites and Sears Holdings’ stores and websites.12If Sears Holdings' perceived financial condition were to significantly deteriorate, our ability to operate our business and our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.We depend on Sears Holdings to provide us with key products and services in the operation of our business. For example, during fiscal year 2013, merchandise acquired from subsidiaries of Sears Holdings, including Kenmore, Craftsman, DieHard and other products, accounted for approximately 84% of total purchases of all inventory from all vendors. If Sears Holdings' financial condition were perceived to have significantly deteriorated and as a consequence Sears Holdings chooses to seek the protection of insolvency proceedings, a court could, among other things, permit or require Sears Holdings to terminate one or more of its existing agreements with us, including without limitation the Merchandising Agreement, the Store License Agreements, and store leases and subleases (many of which are subleased to our dealers and franchisees). Sears Holdings could also choose, or be required, to sell assets, such as its intellectual property rights to the KCD Marks and the trademarks and service names under which we operate our stores that are used by us in the operation of our business, to satisfy Sears Holdings' obligations to its creditors. If Sears Holdings' contractual obligations to us are terminated or assigned to others or if Sears Holdings sells to third parties rights to assets that we use in the course of our business, we could be materially and adversely affected. A termination of our agreements with Sears Holdings could require us to, among other things, find different service and product providers, possibly on short notice. Even if we are able to find replacement products and services, these products and services may not be of the same type or quality as those which are currently provided by Sears Holdings. If we are forced to enter into new contracts for replacement products and services, the new contracts may have terms and conditions that are less favorable to us than those to which we are currently bound. Different products and services, especially if lower in quality and value, and potential increased costs from less favorable contract terms could materially and adversely affect our ability to do business and our financial performance. Risks Relating to Our BusinessIf we fail to offer merchandise and services that our customers want, our sales may be limited, which would reduce our revenues and profits.In order for our business to be successful, we must identify, obtain supplies of, and offer to our customers, attractive, innovative and high-quality merchandise on a continuous basis. Our products and services must satisfy the desires of our customers, whose preferences in appliances, hardware and lawn and garden products may change in the future. If we misjudge either the demand for the products we sell or our customers' purchasing habits and tastes, we may be faced with excess inventories of some products and missed opportunities for products we chose not to offer. In addition, our sales may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower prices, increasing our inventory markdowns and promotional expenses. This would have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.Our business has been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions; a failure of the economy to sustain its recovery, a renewed decline in consumer-spending levels and other conditions, including inflation, could lead to reduced revenues and gross margins, and negatively impact our results of operations.Many economic and other factors are outside of our control, including, consumer confidence and spending levels, consumer and commercial credit availability, inflation, employment levels, housing sales and remodels, lower housing turnover, increased mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates, consumer debt levels, fuel costs and other challenges currently affecting the global economy, the full impact of which on our business, results of operations and financial condition cannot be predicted with certainty. These economic conditions adversely affect the disposable income levels of, and the credit available to, our customers, which could lead to reduced demand for our merchandise. Also affected are our vendors, upon which we depend to provide us with inventory and services. Our vendors could seek to change the terms under which they sell inventory or other services to us which could negatively impact our financial condition. In addition, the inability of vendors to access liquidity, or the insolvency of vendors, could lead to their failure to deliver inventory or other services.The domestic and international political situation also affects consumer confidence. The threat, outbreak or escalation of terrorism, military conflicts or other hostilities could lead to a decrease in consumer spending. Any of these events and factors could cause us to increase inventory markdowns and promotional expenses, thereby reducing our gross margins and operating results.If we do not successfully manage our inventory levels, our operating results will be adversely affected.We must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully. However, we also must avoid accumulating excess inventory as we seek to minimize out-of-stock levels across all product categories and to maintain in-stock levels. We continue to rely on and obtain significant portions of our inventory through the Sears Holdings buying organizations, which obtain a significant portion of inventory from vendors located outside the United States. Some of these vendors often require 13us to provide, through Sears Holdings, lengthy advance notice of our requirements in order to be able to supply products in the quantities we request. This usually requires us, through Sears Holdings, to order merchandise, and enter into purchase order contracts for the purchase and manufacture of such merchandise, well in advance of the time these products will be offered for sale. As a result, we may experience difficulty in responding to a changing retail environment, which makes us vulnerable to changes in price. If we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels will not be appropriate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted.If we are unable to compete effectively in the highly competitive retail industry, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.The retail industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current trade areas and new competitors may enter our trade areas at any time. We compete with a wide variety of retailers, including department stores, discounters, mass merchandisers, hardware stores, independent dealers, home improvement stores, home appliance and consumer electronics retailers, auto service providers, specialty retailers, wholesale clubs and many other competitors operating on a national, regional or local level. Some of our competitors are actively engaged in new store expansion. Online and catalog businesses, which handle similar lines of merchandise, also compete with us.We may not be able to compete successfully against existing and future competitors. Some of our competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than ours and may be able to purchase inventory at lower costs and better endure the current or future economic downturns. As a result, our sales may decline if we cannot offer competitive prices to our customers or we may be required to accept lower profit margins. Our competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and consumer preferences and may have greater resources to devote to promotion and sale of products and services.Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including the following:•Expansion into the suburban and rural trade areas in which many of our stores operate;•Lower pricing;•Offering free delivery and installation of merchandise;•Expanding online sales;•Extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer; and•Larger store size, which may result in greater operational efficiencies, or innovative store formats, and use of disruptive technology.Competition from any of these sources could cause us to lose trade area share, sales and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our operating results are tied in part to the success of our dealers and franchisees, and the inability of our dealers and franchisees to continue operating their stores profitably could adversely affect our operating results.As of February 1, 2014 the significant majority of stores in our Hometown business were operated by independent dealers and franchisees that sell our inventory on a consignment basis. Our dealers’ and franchisees’ ability to continue operating their stores profitably depends on various factors, including their business abilities, financial capabilities (including their access to credit for operating capital), the negotiation of acceptable leases and general economic conditions. Many of the foregoing factors are beyond the control of both SHO and our dealers and franchisees. If our dealers and franchisees are unable to operate their stores profitably, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, if our dealers are unable to operate their stores profitably or in a manner consistent with our concepts and standards, we may be required to take over one or more stores from our dealers from time to time. Generally, at any given time, we operate approximately 3-4% of our Sears Hometown Stores as a result of our taking such stores over from our authorized dealers.Our dealers and franchisees may damage our business or increase our costs by failing to comply with our operating standards or our dealer and franchise agreements.Our authorized dealers operate their stores pursuant to dealer agreements with us. Our franchise business is governed by franchise agreements and applicable franchise law. If our dealers and franchisees do not comply with our established operating concepts and standards or the terms in the franchise or dealer agreements, our business may be damaged. We may incur significant additional costs, including time-consuming and expensive litigation, to enforce our rights under the dealer agreements and the 14franchise agreements. Furthermore, as a franchisor we have obligations to our franchisees. Franchisees may challenge the performance of our obligations under the franchise agreements and subject us to costs in defending these claims and, if the claims are successful, costs in connection with their compliance.In addition, as a franchisor we are subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission and are subject to state laws that govern the offer, sale and termination of franchises and the refusal to renew franchises. The failure to comply with these regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales, fines or require us to make a rescission offer to franchisees, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.Our sales may fluctuate for a variety of reasons, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Our business is sensitive to customers' spending patterns, which in turn are subject to prevailing and perceived longer-term economic conditions. Our sales and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of other factors affect our sales and financial performance, including the following:•Actions by our competitors, including opening of new stores in our existing trade areas or changes to the way these competitors conduct business online;•The availability on commercially reasonable terms of the various types of inventory that we need to sell for the profitable operation of our stores;•Changes in our merchandise strategy and mix;•Real estate and maintenance costs for our existing stores (including disagreements between SHO and Sears Holdings regarding their respective responsibilities for these costs);•Changes in population and other demographics;•Timing and effectiveness of our promotional events; •Weather conditions, including level of rainfall, particularly drought, level of snowfall, average temperature, major storms, and delays in, or advances to, the start of seasonal changes; and•The availability of locations for new stores that can be operated profitability by the Company and by our dealers and franchisees. Accordingly, our results for any one quarter or year are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter or year, and comparable store sales for any particular future period may increase or decrease. For more information on our results of operations, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ESL Investments, Inc. and its affiliates, whose interests may be different from the interests of other stockholders, may be able to exert substantial influence over our Company.According to publicly available information, ESL Investments, Inc. and its investment affiliates including Edward S. Lampert (collectively, "ESL") beneficially own approximately 49% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Accordingly, ESL could have substantial influence over many, if not all, actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders, and will have a significant voice in the election of directors and any transactions involving a change of control, among other matters affecting the Company.The interests of ESL, which has investments in other companies (including, according to publicly available information, ownership of approximately 48% of the outstanding common stock of Sears Holdings), may from time to time differ from, or be opposed to, the interests of our other stockholders. Edward S. Lampert is the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer of Sears Holdings.We may be subject to product liability claims if people or properties are harmed by the products we sell or the services we offer.Some of the products we sell may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury, death, or property damage caused by such products, and may require us to take actions such as product recalls. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.15We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings. These proceedings may be affected by changes in laws and government regulations or changes in the enforcement thereof.From time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business, certain of which may be in jurisdictions with reputations for aggressive application of laws and procedures against corporate defendants. We are impacted by trends in litigation, including class-action allegations brought under various consumer protection and employment laws, including wage and hour laws. We conduct business in jurisdictions with reputations for aggressive application of laws and procedures against corporate defendants. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, these proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require that we devote substantial time and resources to defend our Company. Further, changes in governmental regulations in the United States could have adverse effects on our business and subject us to additional regulatory actions.If we do not maintain the security of our customer, associate and company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation.In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process, and store a large amount of customer, associate, and Company information, including financial information and sensitive personal information. We rely heavily on Sears Holdings’ computer and communications hardware and software systems (such as the point-of-sale system used by the Company and its dealers and franchisees) and related security systems (collectively the "Sears Holdings Systems") to collect, process, and store this information. Sears Holdings Systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by Sears Holdings' associates, our associates, and the associates of our dealers and franchisees. The Sears Holdings Systems may be compromised as a result of criminal activity, negligence, or otherwise. Threats may result from human error, fraud, or malice on the part of Sears Holdings' associates, our associates, and the associates of our dealers, franchisees, and other third parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. Any significant compromise or breach of the Sears Holdings Systems could significantly damage our reputation and result in additional costs, lost sales, fines, government investigations, and lawsuits against, or otherwise adversely affecting, SHO. The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous and complex, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. Additionally, several recent, highly publicized data-security breaches and cyber attacks at other large, nationwide retail companies have heightened consumer awareness of this issue and may embolden individuals or groups to target SHO and the Sears Holdings Systems. There is no guarantee that our reliance on the Sears Holdings Systems and related security measures provided by Sears Holdings will protect information against unauthorized access or that the Sears Holdings Systems and related security measures are adequate to safeguard against data-security breaches. If the Sears Holdings Systems experience a significant data-security breach, or if Sears Holdings or SHO fails to detect and appropriately respond to a significant data-security breach, with respect to our customer, associate, or Company information, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information, which could cause them to stop shopping with us altogether.If we are unable to obtain consents to the assignment or subletting of our store locations from our third-party landlords or are unable to renew or enter into new store leases on competitive terms, our revenues or results of operations could be negatively impacted.Sears Holdings (or one of its subsidiaries) assigned or sublet to us their interests in the leases for all of our stores where Sears Holdings (or one of its subsidiaries), and not SHO or an independent authorized dealer or a franchisee, is the tenant and either (i) the lease for such store permits assignment or subletting of the lease or (ii) Sears Holdings is able to obtain landlord consent to such assignment or sublease. However, a number of the leases for our stores (the “No-Consent Locations”), which number we do not believe is significant, do not permit assignment or subletting by Sears Holdings (or one of its subsidiaries) or may require landlord consent, which may be withheld. Sears Holdings (or one of its subsidiaries) entered into a sublease with us for each of the No-Consent Locations but if the landlord of a No-Consent Location were to claim that such sublease was a default under the applicable lease then we may be forced to close such store location, which could negatively impact our results of operations.In addition, a small number of our stores are in locations where Sears Holdings currently operates one of its stores. In such cases we entered into a lease or sublease with Sears Holdings (or one of its subsidiaries) for the portion of the space in which our store will operate and pay rent directly to Sears Holdings (or one of its subsidiaries) on the terms negotiated in connection with the Separation. If we are unable to negotiate leases or subleases with Sears Holdings (or one of its subsidiaries) on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may be forced to close certain of our stores which could negatively impact our results of operations.16As of February 1, 2014, we leased 61 Company-operated Sears Outlet store locations under long-term agreements with landlords that are unaffiliated with Sears Holdings, leased 51 locations with landlords affiliated with Sears Holdings, and owned three buildings. Additionally, we are the obligor on 19 leases which are sublet to our franchisees that are unaffiliated with Sears Holdings and 9 leases are sublet to franchisees with landlords affiliated with Sears Holdings. If our cost of leasing existing stores increases, we may be unable to maintain our existing store locations as leases expire. Our profitability may decline if we fail to enter into new leases on competitive terms or at all, or we may not be able to locate suitable alternative stores or additional sites for new-store expansion in a timely manner. Furthermore, 49 of our 138 Sears Outlet leases will expire within the next three years and, with respect to 33 of these locations, we do not have lease-renewal rights. A failure to renew or enter into new leases could reduce our revenues and negatively impact our results of operations.In addition, as of February 1, 2014, our Sears Hometown business leased 24 Company-operated locations under long-term agreements with landlords that are unaffiliated with Sears Holdings and leased 6 Company-operated locations under long-term agreements with landlords affiliated with Sears Holdings. Additionally, we are the obligor on an additional 101 leases which are sublet to our franchisees and 4 leases have been assigned to franchisees. If our franchisees are unable to maintain the payments under either our sublease or assigned lease arrangements, we will be required to make payments under the lease. In addition, upon the expiration of the initial lease term, our franchisees are responsible for entering into new leases with existing landlords. If our franchisees are unable to negotiate new leases with existing landlords on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our franchisees may be required to move or close certain of our stores. A failure to maintain payments or to enter into new leases by our franchisees could negatively impact our results of operations.In addition, a number of the leases for both our Outlet and Hometown stores were negotiated by and entered into by a subsidiary of Sears Holdings. Upon the expiration of these leases, we will be required to enter into new leases with the landlords for such properties and we may be unable to enter into new leases as a company independent from Sears Holdings on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Further, a number of our leases were entered into at a time when the commercial real estate market was depressed. We may be required to enter into negotiations with landlords for new leases in the future at times when the commercial real estate market has rebounded and rental payments are generally higher for commercial real estate. Higher leasing costs could negatively impact our results of operations.If we fail to timely and effectively obtain shipments of product from our vendors and deliver merchandise to our customers, our operating results will be adversely affected.We cannot control all of the various factors that might affect our timely and effective procurement of supplies of product from our vendors, including Sears Holdings, and delivery of merchandise to our customers. Our utilization of foreign imports also makes us vulnerable to risks associated with products manufactured abroad, including, among other things, risks of damage, destruction or confiscation of products while in transit to our stores, work stoppages including as a result of events such as strikes, transportation and other delays in shipments including as a result of heightened security screening and inspection processes or other port-of-entry limitations or restrictions in the United States, lack of freight availability and freight cost increases. In addition, if we experience a shortage of a popular item, we may be required to arrange for additional quantities of the item, if available, to be delivered to us through airfreight, which is significantly more expensive than standard shipping by sea. As a result, we may not be able to obtain sufficient freight capacity on a timely basis or at favorable shipping rates and, therefore, we may not be able to timely receive merchandise from our vendors or deliver our products to our customers.We rely upon Sears Holdings and other third-party land-based carriers for merchandise shipments to our stores and customers. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activity, inclement weather and increased transportation costs, associated with such carriers' ability to provide delivery services to meet our inbound and outbound shipping needs. In addition, if the cost of fuel continues to rise or remains at current levels, the cost to deliver merchandise to our stores may rise which could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Failure to procure and deliver merchandise either to us or to our customers in a timely, effective and economically viable manner could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business. In addition, any increase in distribution costs and expenses could adversely affect our future financial performance.As a public company we have increased expenses and administrative burdens, in particular to comply with certain provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.As a public company, we are incurring legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur prior to the Separation. These increased costs and expenses have arisen from various factors, including financial reporting, costs associated with complying with federal securities laws (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), tax administration, and legal and human-resources related functions. Although a number of these functions continue to be performed for us by subsidiaries of Sears Holdings, we have been required to, among other things, create or revise the roles and duties of our board committees, adopt additional 17internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures, retain a transfer agent and adopt an insider trading policy in compliance with our obligations under the securities laws.Being a public company subject to additional laws, rules and regulations has required the investment of additional resources to ensure ongoing compliance with such laws, rules and regulations. In addition, these laws, rules and regulations have affected our ability to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee.Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley could have a material adverse effect on our business and the market price of our common stock.As a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting along with a report by our independent registered public accounting firm that addresses the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. During the course of our testing, we may at any time identify deficiencies which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet our deadline for compliance with Section 404. Testing and maintaining internal control can divert our management’s attention from other matters that are also important to the operation of our business. The imposition of these regulations has increased, and may continue to increase, our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we do not maintain effective internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial information on a timely basis, which could harm the trading price of our common stock, impair our ability to raise additional capital, or jeopardize our continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market or any other stock exchange on which our common stock may be listed.We could incur charges due to impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets.As of February 1, 2014 we had a goodwill balance of $167 million, which has been assigned to our Hometown Stores and Home Appliance Showrooms ("Hometown Reporting Unit") and is subject to periodic testing for impairment. Our long-lived assets, primarily stores, also are subject to periodic testing for impairment. A significant amount of judgment is involved in the periodic testing. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow within our Hometown Reporting Unit, or at individual store locations, could result in impairment charges for goodwill or fixed asset impairment for long-lived assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations. Relative to goodwill, the 2013 annual impairment test concluded that no goodwill impairment existed. However, the estimated fair value of the Hometown Reporting Unit exceeded its carrying value by 9.2%, which is a decrease from the step one test that was performed in 2012 that passed by 19.4%. A continued decline in the estimated fair value of our Hometown Reporting Unit below its carrying amount could trigger an impairment of some or all of its goodwill. Our goodwill impairment analysis also includes a comparison of the aggregate estimated fair value of all reporting units to our total market capitalization. If our stock trades below our book value a significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization could result in goodwill impairment charges. During times of financial market volatility, significant judgment will be used to determine the underlying cause of the decline and whether stock price declines are short-term in nature or indicative of an event or change in circumstances. Impairment charges, if any, resulting from the periodic testing are non-cash. For additional information see "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Risks Relating to our IndebtednessWe and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, which could substantially reduce our profitability, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, and reduce the value of your investment.At February 1, 2014 we had approximately $99.1 million of debt outstanding. The instruments governing our indebtedness do not prevent us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional debt in the future or other obligations that do not constitute indebtedness, which could increase the risks described below and lead to other risks. In addition, we may, subject to certain conditions, increase the borrowing capacity under our Senior ABL Facility without the consent of any person other than the institutions agreeing to provide all or any portion of such increase, by an amount not to exceed $100 million. The amount of our debt or such other obligations could have important consequences for holders of our common stock, including, but not limited to:18•our ability to satisfy obligations to lenders may be impaired, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of our indebtedness;•our ability to obtain additional financing for refinancing of existing indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures, product and service development, acquisitions, general corporate purposes and other purposes may be impaired;•a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt;•we may be increasingly vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates;•our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and the retail industry may be limited; and•we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry.Our Senior ABL Facility contains financial and operating covenants and restrictions that limit our operations and could lead to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with them.The Senior ABL Facility contains certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions relating to, among other things, excess availability and fixed charge coverage ratios, as well as limitations on indebtedness (including guarantees of additional indebtedness) and liens, mergers, consolidations and dissolutions, sales of assets, investments and acquisitions, dividends and other restricted payments (such as stock repurchases), and certain transactions with affiliates. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Senior ABL Facility” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Failure to comply with these financial and operating covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, or changes in general economic conditions, which may be beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the Senior ABL Facility that would permit the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we are unable to repay such amounts, lenders having secured obligations, such as the lenders under the Senior ABL Facility, could proceed against the collateral securing the secured obligations. In any such case, we may be unable to borrow under the Senior ABL Facility and may not be able to repay amounts due under such facility. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent. In addition, these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions (i) that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders or (ii) without which our business and operations could be harmed.Increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability.A significant portion of our outstanding debt, including amounts under the Senior ABL Facility, bears interest at variable rates. As a result, increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. Assuming our Senior ABL Facility was fully drawn in a principal amount equal to $250 million, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in a $2.5 million change in annual cash interest expense on our Senior ABL Facility.We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.Any reductions in our available borrowing capacity under the Senior ABL Facility, or our inability to renew or replace our Senior ABL Facility, when required or when business conditions warrant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The economic conditions, credit market conditions and economic climate affecting the retail industry, as well as other factors, may constrain our financing abilities. Our ability to secure additional financing, if available, and to satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance, the availability of credit generally, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The market conditions and the macroeconomic conditions that affect the retail industry could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure financing on favorable terms, if at all.We may be unable to secure additional financing or financing on favorable terms or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under the indebtedness outstanding from time to time. Furthermore, if financing is not available when needed, or is available on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution.Risks Relating to Our Common StockOur common stock has limited trading history. If our share price fluctuates, you could lose all or a significant part of your investment.19Our common stock has traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “SHOS” only since October 2012. There can be no assurance that an active and liquid trading market for our common stock will be sustained in the future. The lack of an active market may make it more difficult for you to sell our shares and could lead to our share price being depressed or more volatile.We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade in the future. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including the following:•Our business profile and market capitalization may not continue to fit the investment objectives of some stockholders and, as a result, these stockholders may sell our shares;•Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;•Our ability to decrease our reliance on products and services provided by Sears Holdings and ability to diversify our supply chain;•Success or failure of our business strategy;•Our relationship with Sears Holdings;•Actual or anticipated changes in the U.S. economy or the retailing environment;•Our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;•Our ability to obtain third-party financing as needed;•Announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;•The failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;•Changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;•The operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;•Overall market fluctuations;•Changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;•Actual or anticipated sales or distributions of our capital stock by our officers, directors or significant stockholders;•Terrorist acts or wars; and•General economic conditions and other external factors.In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like us. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.Our common stock may have a low trading volume and limited liquidity, resulting from a continued lack of analyst coverage and institutional interest.Our common stock may continue to receive limited attention from market analysts. Lack of up-to-date analyst coverage may make it difficult for potential investors to fully understand our operations and business fundamentals, which may limit our trading volume. Low trading volumes and lack of analyst coverage may limit your ability to resell your common stock.Our common stock price may decline if ESL decides to sell a portion of its holdings of our common stock.According to publicly available information ESL beneficially owns approximately 49% of our outstanding common stock. ESL will, in its sole discretion, determine the timing and terms of any transactions with respect to its shares in us, taking into account business and market conditions and other factors that it deems relevant. ESL is not subject to any contractual obligation to maintain its ownership position in us, although it may be subject to certain transfer restrictions imposed by securities laws. Consequently, we cannot assure you that ESL will maintain its ownership interest in us. Any sale by ESL of our common stock or any announcement by ESL that it has decided to sell shares of our common stock, or the perception by the investment community that ESL has sold or decided to sell shares of our common stock, could have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.Your percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future.Your percentage ownership in SHO may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that may be granted to our directors, officers and employees in the future. During our fiscal year 2013, we made awards of restricted stock to members of our senior management including our executive officers and we may decide to make additional equity-based awards, as well as establish equity incentive plans that may provide for the grant of common stock-based equity awards to our directors, officers and other employees. In addition, we may issue equity in order to raise capital or in connection with future acquisitions and strategic investments, which would dilute your percentage ownership.We do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.20We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in our operations. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock in the form of cash dividends.21Item 1B.
