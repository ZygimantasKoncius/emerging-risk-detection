ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The Company is subject to various risks, many of which are beyond the Company's control, which could have a negative effect on the Company and its financial condition. As a result of these and other factors, the Company may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. An investment in the Company's stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report"), and those that are detailed from time to time in the Company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, before you decide whether to purchase the Company's common stock. The Company was a plaintiff in a legal proceeding seeking recovery of damages for the loss of the Company's investment in Carteret which was settled in October 2012. The Settlement Agreement provides for a tax gross-up. There can be no assurance of a favorable outcome for the Company regarding receipt of the tax gross-up. The Company's tax return has not been reviewed by the IRS, there can be no assurance as to the amount of federal taxes ultimately imposed by the IRS. The Company cannot predict the final amount of any tax gross-up ultimately received by the Company pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The Company was a plaintiff in a legal proceeding seeking recovery of damages from the United States Government for the loss of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Carteret Savings Bank, F.A. This legal proceeding was commenced in 1993 (the "Supervisory Goodwill" legal proceedings). A Settlement Agreement in the Supervisory Goodwill legal proceedings between the Company, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Receiver ("FDIC-R") and the Department of Justice ("DOJ") on behalf of the United States of America (the "United States"), was executed (the "Settlement Agreement") which was subject to approval by the United States Court of Federal Claims (the "Court of Federal Claims"). On October 11, 2012, the Court of Federal Claims issued an order approving the Settlement Agreement, and on October 19, 2012, the United States paid $180,650,000 (one hundred eighty million, six hundred fifty thousand dollars) directly to AmBase. As the IRS has not reviewed the Company's 2012 federal income tax return, as filed, the Company cannot predict the amount of federal taxes ultimately imposed by the IRS or payable by the Company; and therefore, the Company cannot predict the final amount of any tax gross-up ultimately received by the Company pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The Company is subject to risks inherent in owning and leasing real estate. The Company is subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to leasing and owning real estate, many of which are beyond the Company's control. In addition to general risks related to owning commercial real estate, the Company's risks include, among others: - Deterioration in regional and local economic and real estate market conditions, - potential changes in supply of, or demand for rental properties similar to the Company's, - competition for tenants and changes in rental rates, - concentration in a single real estate asset and class, - difficulty in reletting properties on favorable terms or at all, - impairments in the Company's ability to collect rent payments when due, - the potential for uninsured casualty and other losses, - the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws, - adverse changes in zoning laws and other regulations, - changes in federal or state tax laws, and - acts of terrorism and war. Each of these factors could cause a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which means that the Company's ability to promptly sell the Company's property in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited. The Company is in a competitive business. The real estate industry is highly competitive. The Company competes for tenants for its unoccupied rental space with a large number of real estate property owners and other companies that sublet properties. The Company's principal means of competition are rents charged in relation to the income producing potential of the location. In addition, the Company expects other major real estate investors, some with much greater resources than the Company has, may compete with the Company for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include REITs, investment banking firms and private institutional investors. This competition has increased prices for commercial properties and may impair the Company's ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in the future. The Company may not be able to insure certain risks economically. The Company may experience economic harm if any damage to the Company's property is not covered by insurance. The Company cannot be certain that the Company will be able to insure all risks that the Company desires to insure economically or that all of the Company's insurers will be financially viable if the Company makes a claim. The Company may suffer losses that are not covered under the Company's insurance policies. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits should occur, the Company could lose capital invested in a property, as well as any future revenue from the property. Changes in the composition of the Company's assets and liabilities through acquisitions, divestitures or corporate restructuring may affect the Company's results. The Company may make future acquisitions or divestitures of assets or changes in how such assets are held. Any change in the composition of the Company's assets and liabilities or how such assets and liabilities are held could significantly affect the Company's financial position and the risks that the Company faces. The Company may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize the Company's deferred tax asset. The Company has federal income tax net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards and other tax attributes that have been assumed to be utilized due to the uncertain tax position reserve recognized by the Company. Because the Company from time to time maintains a majority of its assets in securities, the Company may in the future be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 resulting in additional costs and regulatory burdens. Currently, the Company believes that either it is not within the definition of "Investment Company" as the term is defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") or, alternatively, may rely on one or more of the 1940 Act's exemptions. The Company intends to continue to conduct its operations in a manner that will exempt the Company from the registration requirements of the 1940 Act. If the Company were to be deemed to be an investment company because of the Company's investments securities holdings, the Company would be required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act places significant restrictions on the capital structure and corporate governance of a registered investment company, and materially restricts its ability to conduct transactions with affiliates. Compliance with the 1940 Act could also increase the Company's operating costs. Such changes could have a material adverse affect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market, on which the Company's common stock trades, the markets in which the Company operates the Company's operations and the Company's results of operations. Terrorist attacks or armed conflicts could affect the Company's business or the businesses of the Company's tenants. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and the Company may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on the Company's business. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economy. They also could be a factor resulting in, or a continuation of, an economic recession in the U.S. or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on the Company's operating results and revenues and may result in volatility of the market price for the Company's common stock.
