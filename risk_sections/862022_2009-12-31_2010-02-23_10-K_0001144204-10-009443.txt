Item 1A, Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The only assets of and sources of income to the trust are the net profits interests, which generally entitle the trust to receive a share of the net profits from oil and gas production from the underlying properties. Consequently, the trust is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in oil and gas prices. The trust is a passive entity and, other than the trusts ability to periodically borrow money as necessary to pay expenses, liabilities and obligations of the trust that cannot be paid out of cash held by the trust, the trust is prohibited from engaging in borrowing transactions. The amount of any such borrowings is unlikely to be material to the trust. In addition, the trustee is prohibited by the trust indenture from engaging in any business activity or causing the trust to enter into any investments other than investing cash on hand in specific short-term cash investments. Therefore, the trust cannot hold any derivative financial instruments. As a result of the limited nature of its borrowing and investing activities, the trust is not subject to any material interest rate market risk. Additionally, any gains or losses from any hedging activities conducted by XTO Energy are specifically excluded from the calculation of net proceeds due the trust under the forms of the conveyances. The trust does not engage in transactions in foreign currencies which could expose the trust to any foreign currency related market risk. Item 8.

Trust Organization and Provisions Hugoton Royalty Trust was created on December 1, 1998 by XTO Energy Inc. (formerly known as Cross Timbers Oil Company). Effective on that date, XTO Energy conveyed 80% net profits interests in certain predominantly gas-producing working interest properties in Kansas, Oklahoma and Wyoming to the trust under separate conveyances for each of the three states. In exchange for the conveyances of the net profits interests to the trust, XTO Energy received 40 million units of beneficial interest in the trust. The trusts initial public offering was in April 1999. The majority of the underlying working interest properties are currently owned and operated by XTO Energy (Note 7). Bank of America, N.A. is the trustee for the trust. In 2007 the Bank of America private wealth management group officially became known as U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management. The legal entity that serves as the trustee of the trust did not change, and references in this Annual Report to U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management shall describe the legal entity Bank of America, N.A. The trust indenture provides, among other provisions, that:  the trust cannot engage in any business activity or acquire any assets other than the net profits interests and specific short-term cash investments;  the trust may dispose of all or part of the net profits interests if approved by 80% of the unitholders, or upon trust termination. Otherwise, the trust may sell up to 1% of the value of the net profits interests in any calendar year, pursuant to notice from XTO Energy of its desire to sell the related underlying properties. Any sale must be for cash with the proceeds promptly distributed to the unitholders;  the trustee may establish a cash reserve for payment of any liability that is contingent or not currently payable;  the trustee may borrow funds to pay trust liabilities if repaid in full prior to further distributions to unitholders;  the trustee will make monthly cash distributions to unitholders (Note 3); and  the trust will terminate upon the first occurrence of: - disposition of all net profits interests pursuant to terms of the trust indenture, - gross proceeds from the underlying properties falling below $1 million per year for two successive years, or - a vote of 80% of the unitholders to terminate the trust in accordance with provisions of the trust indenture. 2. Basis of Accounting The financial statements of the trust are prepared on the following basis and are not intended to present financial position and results of operations in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles:  Net profits income is recorded in the month received by the trustee (Note 3).  Trust expenses are recorded based on liabilities paid and cash reserves established by the trustee for liabilities and contingencies.  Distributions to unitholders are recorded when declared by the trustee (Note 3). The most significant differences between the trusts financial statements and those prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are:  Net profits income is recognized in the month received rather than accrued in the month of production. 28 TABLE OF CONTENTS HUGOTON ROYALTY TRUST NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2. Basis of Accounting  (continued)  Expenses are recognized when paid rather than when incurred.  Cash reserves may be established by the trustee for contingencies that would not be recorded under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This comprehensive basis of accounting corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts. Most accounting pronouncements apply to entities whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, directing such entities to accrue or defer revenues and expenses in a period other than when such revenues were received or expenses were paid. Because the trusts financial statements are prepared on the modified cash basis, as described above, most accounting pronouncements are not applicable to the trusts financial statements. In May 2009, the trust adopted the authoritative guidance of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. We have evaluated subsequent events through February 22, 2010. The initial carrying value of the net profits interests of $247,066,951 was XTO Energys historical net book value of the interests on December 1, 1998, the date of the transfer to the trust. Amortization of the net profits interests is calculated on a unit-of-production basis and charged directly to trust corpus. Accumulated amortization was $107,189,371 as of December 31, 2009 and $100,344,936 as of December 31, 2008. 3. Distributions to Unitholders The trustee determines the amount to be distributed to unitholders each month by totaling net profits income, interest income and other cash receipts, and subtracting liabilities paid and adjustments in cash reserves established by the trustee. The resulting amount is distributed to unitholders of record within ten business days after the monthly record date, which is the last business day of the month. Net profits income received by the trustee consists of net proceeds received in the prior month by XTO Energy from the underlying properties, multiplied by 80%. Net proceeds are the gross proceeds received from the sale of production, less costs. Costs generally include applicable taxes, transportation, legal and marketing charges, production expense, development and drilling costs, and overhead (Note 7). XTO Energy, as owner of the underlying properties, computes net profits income separately for each of the three conveyances (one for each of the states of Kansas, Oklahoma and Wyoming). If costs exceed revenues for any conveyance, such excess costs must be recovered, with accrued interest, from future net proceeds of that conveyance and cannot reduce net profits income from the other conveyances (Note 4). 4. Excess Costs Costs exceeded revenues by $513,475 ($410,780 to the trust) on properties underlying the Kansas net profits interests in October and November 2009. Lower gas prices due to reduced demand as a result of the U.S. recession and excess supply caused costs to exceed revenues on properties underlying the Kansas net profits interests. However, these excess costs did not reduce net proceeds from the remaining conveyances. XTO Energy advised the trustee that increased gas prices led to the partial recovery of excess costs of $410,957 ($328,766 net to the trust), plus accrued interest of $1,958 ($1,566 net to the trust) in December 2009 and the full recovery of excess costs, plus accrued interest in January 2010. Costs exceeded revenues by $970,780 ($776,624 net to the trust) on properties underlying the Wyoming net profits interests in November 2008. Scheduled pipeline maintenance and limited regional demand led to lower realized gas prices for production in the Rocky Mountain region. These lower gas prices caused costs to exceed revenues on properties underlying the Wyoming net profits interest, however, these excess costs did 29 TABLE OF CONTENTS HUGOTON ROYALTY TRUST NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 4. Excess Costs  (continued) not reduce net proceeds from the remaining conveyances. XTO Energy advised the trustee that the onset of winter demand and completion of scheduled pipeline maintenance led to a partial rebound of Rocky Mountain gas prices, resulting in the full recovery of excess costs plus accrued interest of $3,192 ($2,554 net to the trust) in December 2008. Costs exceeded revenues by $853,468 ($682,774 net to the trust) on properties underlying the Wyoming net profits interests in November and December 2007. Limited pipeline capacity and moderate regional demand led to lower realized regional gas prices for production in the Rocky Mountain region. These lower gas prices caused costs to exceed revenues on properties underlying the Wyoming net profits interests, however, these excess costs did not reduce net proceeds from the remaining conveyances. XTO Energy advised the trustee that with the onset of winter demand and the completion of the first phase of a major pipeline expansion in January 2008, Rocky Mountain gas prices increased and the excess costs, plus accrued interest of $10,090 ($8,072 net to the trust), were fully recovered by February 2008. 5. Development Costs The following summarizes actual development costs, budgeted development costs deducted in the calculation of net profits income, and the cumulative actual costs compared to the amount deducted: Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 Cumulative actual costs (over) under the amount deducted  beginning of period $ (7,314,084) $ (675,754 ) $ (3,410,174 ) Actual costs (12,776,439) (52,638,330 ) (40,015,580 ) Budgeted costs deducted 21,000,000 46,000,000 42,750,000 Cumulative actual costs under (over) the amount deducted  end of period $ 909,477 $ (7,314,084 ) $ (675,754 ) The development cost deduction was lowered to $3.75 million per month beginning with the February 2007 distribution. Due to lower than anticipated actual costs as a result of the timing of expenditures, the development cost deduction was lowered to $2.0 million for the April and May 2007 distributions, but was increased to $3.75 million with the June 2007 distribution and was maintained at $3.75 million for the remainder of 2007 through the August 2008 distribution. Due to higher than anticipated costs as a result of the timing of expenditures, the monthly development cost deduction was increased to $4.0 million beginning with the September 2008 distribution and was maintained at that level through the March 2009 distribution. As a result of decreased development activity and revisions to the 2009 development budget, the development cost deduction was decreased to $2.0 million beginning with the April 2009 distribution, to $1.0 million beginning with the June 2009 distribution and to $500,000 beginning with the September 2009 distribution and was maintained at the level for the remainder of 2009. The monthly deduction is based in the current level of development expenditures, budgeted future development costs and the cumulative actual costs under (over) previous deductions. XTO Energy has advised the trustee that this monthly deduction will continue to be evaluated and revised as necessary. 6. Federal Income Taxes Tax counsel has advised the trust that, under current tax laws, the trust will be classified as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes and, therefore, is not subject to taxation at the trust level. However, the opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service. For federal income tax purposes, unitholders of a grantor trust are considered to own the trusts income and principal as though no trust were in existence. The income of the trust is deemed to be received or accrued by the unitholders at the time such income is received or accrued by the trust, rather than when distributed by the trust. 30 TABLE OF CONTENTS HUGOTON ROYALTY TRUST NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 6. Federal Income Taxes  (continued) The trust is a widely held fixed investment trust (WHFIT) classified as a non-mortgage widely held fixed investment trust (NMWHFIT) for federal income tax purposes. The trustee is the representative of the trust that will provide tax information in accordance with the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the trust as a WHFIT or a NMWHFIT. 7. XTO Energy Inc. XTO Energy operates approximately 94% of the underlying properties. In computing net proceeds, XTO Energy deducts an overhead charge for reimbursement of administrative expenses on the underlying properties it operates. As of December 31, 2009, the overhead charge was approximately $911,000 ($728,800 net to the trust) per month and is subject to annual adjustment based on an oil and gas industry index as defined in the trust agreement. XTO Energy sells a significant portion of natural gas production from the underlying properties to certain of XTO Energys wholly owned subsidiaries under contracts in existence when the trust was created, generally at amounts approximating monthly published market prices. Most of the production from the Hugoton area is sold under a contract to Timberland Gathering & Processing Company, Inc. (TGPC) based on the index price. Much of the gas production in Major County, Oklahoma is sold to Ringwood Gathering Company (RGC), which retains approximately $0.31 per Mcf as a compression and gathering fee. TGPC and RGC sell gas to Cross Timbers Energy Services, Inc. (CTES), which markets gas to third parties. XTO Energy sells directly to CTES most gas production not sold directly to TGPC or RGC. Total gas sales from the underlying properties to XTO Energys wholly owned subsidiaries were $42.2 million for 2009, or 47% of total gas sales, $103.3 million for 2008, or 47% of total gas sales and $76.6 million for 2007, or 48% of total gas sales. On December 13, 2009, XTO Energy entered into a definitive merger agreement with Exxon Mobil Corporation under which XTO Energy would become a wholly owned subsidiary of ExxonMobil. The completion of this merger is subject to certain conditions, including approval of the merger agreement by XTO Energy stockholders and certain government and regulatory approvals. The merger is not expected to have a material effect on trust annual distributable income, financial position or liquidity. The merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2010. 8. Contingencies Litigation On October 17, 1997, an action, styled United States of America ex rel. Grynberg v. Cross Timbers Oil Company, et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma by Jack J. Grynberg on behalf of the United States under the qui tam provisions of the U.S. False Claims Act against XTO Energy. Grynberg alleges that XTO Energy underpaid royalties on natural gas produced from federal leases and lands owned by Native Americans in amounts in excess of 20% as a result of mismeasuring the volume of natural gas, incorrectly analyzing its heating content and improperly valuing the natural gas. Grynberg seeks treble damages for the unpaid royalties (with interest, attorneys fees and expenses), civil penalties between $5,000 and $10,000 for each violation of the U.S. False Claims Act, and an order for XTO Energy to cease the allegedly improper measuring practices. This lawsuit against XTO Energy and similar lawsuits filed by Grynberg against more than 300 other companies was consolidated in the United States District Court for Wyoming. In October 2002, the court granted a motion to dismiss Grynbergs royalty valuation claims, and Grynbergs appeal of this decision was dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction in May 2003. In response to a motion to dismiss filed by XTO Energy and other defendants, in October 2006 the district judge held that Grynberg failed to establish the jurisdictional requirements to maintain the action against XTO Energy and other defendants and dismissed the actions for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Grynberg filed an appeal of this decision to the United States Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. In March 2009, 31 TABLE OF CONTENTS HUGOTON ROYALTY TRUST NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 8. Contingencies  (continued) the Tenth Circuit affirmed the trial courts dismissal of the case and the U.S. Supreme Court has denied Grynbergs application for appeal. XTO Energy has entered into an agreement with the plaintiff whereby XTO Energy and the plaintiff dismissed all claims against each other. The court granted the dismissal of the claims on November 3, 2009, effectively ending this case. An amended petition for a class action lawsuit, Beer, et al. v. XTO Energy Inc., was filed in January 2006 in the District Court of Texas County, Oklahoma by certain royalty owners of natural gas wells in Oklahoma and Kansas. The plaintiffs allege that XTO Energy has not properly accounted to the plaintiffs for the royalties to which they are entitled and seek an accounting regarding the natural gas and other products produced from their wells and the prices paid for the natural gas and other products produced, and for payment of the monies allegedly owed since June 2002, with a certain limited number of plaintiffs claiming monies owed for additional time. XTO Energy removed the case to federal district court in Oklahoma City. A hearing on the class certification was conducted in October 2008. At the class certification hearing, the plaintiffs sought to certify a class of royalty owners whose wells were connected to a processing plant owned by a subsidiary of XTO Energy in the Hugoton Field, with two sub-classes consisting of owners in Oklahoma and Kansas. In March 2009, the District Court granted the motion to certify the class. The plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment for only the two named plaintiffs. The court granted the motion in the amount of $12,779. A motion for summary judgment related to the remainder of the class is pending. Trial on the merits is scheduled for 2010. The plaintiffs have not alleged in their petition an amount that they are seeking. XTO Energy has informed the trustee that it believes that it has strong defenses to this lawsuit and intends to vigorously defend its position. The case is set for trial in 2010. However, if XTO Energy ultimately makes any settlement payments or receives a judgment against it, the trust will bear its 80% share of such settlement or judgment related to production from the underlying properties. Additionally, if a judgment or settlement increases the amount of future payments to royalty owners, the trust would bear its proportionate share of the increased payments through reduced net proceeds. XTO Energy has informed the trustee that, although the amount of any reduction in net proceeds is not presently determinable, in its managements opinion, the amount is not currently expected to be material to the trusts annual distributable income, financial position or liquidity. It could, however, result in costs exceeding revenues on the properties underlying the Oklahoma and Kansas net profit interests for one or more monthly distributions, depending on the size of the judgment or settlement, if any, and the net proceeds being paid at that time. In September 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed against XTO Energy styled Wallace B. Roderick Revocable Living Trust, et al. v. XTO Energy Inc. in the District Court of Kearny County, Kansas. XTO Energy removed the case to federal court in Wichita, Kansas. The plaintiffs allege that XTO Energy has improperly taken post-production costs from royalties paid to the plaintiffs from wells located in Kansas, Oklahoma and Colorado. The plaintiffs also seek to represent all royalty owners in these three states as a class. The plaintiffs claims overlap the claims made by the plaintiffs in the Beer case as to certain properties. XTO Energy has answered, denying all claims, and has filed motions to dismiss a portion of the claims. The federal court recently granted XTO Energys motion for summary judgment concerning prior settled class actions that overlap plaintiffs proposed class action. The court also granted XTO Energys motion to dismiss those portions of plaintiffs class that are currently being prosecuted in the Beer class action discussed above. XTO Energy has informed the trustee that it believes that XTO Energy has strong defenses to this lawsuit and intends to vigorously defend its position. However, if XTO Energy ultimately makes any settlement payments or receives a judgment against it, the trust will bear its 80% share of such settlement or judgment related to production from the underlying properties. Additionally, if the judgment or settlement increases the amount of future payments to royalty owners, the trust would bear its proportionate share of the increased payments through reduced net proceeds. XTO Energy has informed the trustee that, although the amount of any reduction in net proceeds is not presently determinable, in its managements opinion, the amount is not currently expected to be material to the trusts annual distributable income, financial position or liquidity. It could, however, result in costs exceeding revenues on the properties underlying the Oklahoma and Kansas net 32 TABLE OF CONTENTS HUGOTON ROYALTY TRUST NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 8. Contingencies  (continued) profit interests for one or more monthly distributions, depending on the size of the judgment or settlement, if any, and the net proceeds being paid at that time. Certain of the underlying properties are involved in various other lawsuits and certain governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. XTO Energy has advised the trustee that it does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims will have a material effect on trust annual distributable income, financial position or liquidity. Other Several states have enacted legislation to require state income tax withholding from nonresident recipients of oil and gas proceeds. After consultation with its state tax counsel, XTO Energy has advised the trustee that it believes the trust is not subject to these withholding requirements. However, regulations could be issued by the various states which could change this conclusion. Should the trust be required to withhold state taxes, distributions to the unitholders would be reduced by the required amount, subject to the unitholders right to file a state tax return to claim any refund due. 9. Supplemental Oil and Gas Reserve Information (Unaudited) Oil and Natural Gas Reserves The trusts proved oil and gas reserves have been estimated by independent petroleum engineers. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulation before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well. Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available. The reserves actually recovered and the timing of production of these reserves may be substantially different from the original estimate. Revisions result primarily from new information obtained from development drilling and production history and from changes in economic factors. Standardized Measure The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes in such cash flows are prepared using assumptions required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Such assumptions include the use of 12-month average prices for oil and gas, based on the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period for 2009, and year end costs for estimated future development and production expenditures to produce the proved reserves. Prior to 2009, standardized measure was calculated using year end oil and gas prices and costs. Future net cash flows are discounted at an annual rate of 10%. No provision is included for federal income taxes since future net cash flows are not subject to taxation at the trust level. Estimated costs to plug and abandon wells on the underlying working interest properties at the end of their productive lives have not been deducted from cash flows since this is not a legal obligation of the trust. These costs are the legal obligation of XTO Energy as the owner of the underlying working interests and will only be deducted from net proceeds payable to the trust if net proceeds from the related conveyance exceed such costs when paid, subject to excess cost carryforward provisions (Note 3). The standardized measure does not represent managements estimate of our future cash flows or the value of proved oil and gas reserves. Probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. Furthermore, prices used to determine the standardized measure are influenced by supply and demand as effected by recent economic conditions as well as other factors and may not be the most representative in estimating future revenues or reserve data. 33 TABLE OF CONTENTS HUGOTON ROYALTY TRUST NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 9. Supplemental Oil and Gas Reserve Information (Unaudited)  (continued) The average realized gas prices used to determine the standardized measure were $3.28 per Mcf in 2009, $4.47 per Mcf in 2008, $6.72 per Mcf in 2007 and $5.60 per Mcf in 2006. Oil prices used to determine the standardized measure were based on average realized oil prices of $57.17 per Bbl in 2009, $42.13 per Bbl in 2008, $95.73 per Bbl in 2007 and $58.02 per Bbl in 2006. In 2009, we used average oil and gas prices, based on the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period. For periods prior to 2009, we used year end oil and gas prices.

Revisions of prior estimates of the proved gas reserves for the underlying properties in each year are primarily because of changes in the gas and oil prices. Higher upward and downward revisions for the net profits interests as compared with the underlying properties in each year were caused by changes in oil and gas prices and estimated future production and development costs which resulted in an increase or decrease in gas reserves allocated to the trust.

We also have audited Hugoton Royalty Trusts internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The trustee of Hugoton Royalty Trust is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the trusts internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the trustee, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As described in note 2 to the financial statements, these financial statements were prepared on the modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The trusts internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with the modified cash basis of accounting. The trusts internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the trust; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with the modified cash basis of accounting, and that receipts and expenditures of the trust are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the trustee; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the trusts assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities, and trust corpus of Hugoton Royalty Trust as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and its distributable income and changes in trust corpus for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with the modified cash basis of accounting described in note 2. Also in our opinion, Hugoton Royalty Trust maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on control criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. KPMG LLP Fort Worth, Texas February 22, 2010 37 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure There have been no changes in accountants and no disagreements with the trusts independent registered public accountants on any matter of accounting principles or practices or financial statement disclosures during the two years ended December 31, 2009. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The trustee conducted an evaluation of the trusts disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, the trustee has concluded that the trusts disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. In its evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, the trustee has relied, to the extent considered reasonable, on information provided by XTO Energy. Trustees Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The trustee, Bank of America, N.A., also known as U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The trustee conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the trusts internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the trustees evaluation under the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework, the trustee concluded that the trusts internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009. The effectiveness of the trusts internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. There were no changes in the trusts internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the trusts internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information None. 38 TABLE OF CONTENTS PART III Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance The trust has no directors, executive officers or audit committee. The trustee is a corporate trustee which may be removed, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all the units then outstanding. Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that beneficial owners of more than 10% of the registrants equity securities file initial reports of beneficial ownership and reports of changes in beneficial ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange. The Securities and Exchange Commission has taken the position that executive officers and directors of XTO Energy must also file initial ownership reports and reports of changes in beneficial ownership. Copies of the reports must be provided to the trustee. To the trustees knowledge, based solely on the information furnished to the trustee, the trustee is unaware of any person that failed to file on a timely basis reports required by Section 16(a) filing requirements with respect to the trust units of beneficial interest during and for the year ended December 31, 2009, other than one late filing of one transaction on Form 4 by Bob R. Simpson, the Chairman of the Board and Founder and Director of XTO Energy Inc. The transaction has now been reported. Because the trust has no employees, it does not have a code of ethics. Employees of the trustee, U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management, must comply with the banks code of ethics, a copy of which will be provided to unitholders, without charge, upon request by appointment at Bank of America Plaza, 17th Floor, 901 Main Street, Dallas, Texas 75202. Item 11. Executive Compensation The trustee received the following annual compensation from 2007 through 2009 as specified in the trust indenture: Name and Principal Position Year Other Annual Compensation(1) U.S. Trust, Bank of America 2009 $ 48,126 Private Wealth Management, Trustee 2008 45,602 2007 43,022 (1) Under the trust indenture, the trustee is entitled to an annual administrative fee, paid in equal monthly installments. Such fee can be adjusted annually based on an oil and gas industry index. Upon termination of the trust, the trustee is entitled to a termination fee of $15,000. Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Unitholder Matters The trust has no equity compensation plans. (a) Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners. The trustee is not aware of any person who beneficially owns more than 5% of the outstanding units. (b) Security Ownership of Management. The trust has no directors or executive officers. As of February 3, 2010, Bank of America, N.A. owned, in various fiduciary capacities, 235,017 units, with a shared right to vote 111,037 of these units and no right to vote 123,980 of these units. Bank of America, N.A. disclaims any beneficial interests in these units. The number of units reflected in this paragraph includes units held by all branches of Bank of America, N.A. (c) Changes in Control. The trustee knows of no arrangements which may subsequently result in a change in control of the trust. Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence In computing net profits income paid to the trust for the net profits interests, XTO Energy deducts an overhead charge for reimbursement of administrative expenses of operating the underlying properties. This charge at December 31, 2009 was approximately $911,000 per month, or $10,932,000 annually (net to the 39 TABLE OF CONTENTS trust of $728,800 per month or $8,745,600 annually), and is subject to annual adjustment based on an oil and gas industry index as defined in the trust agreement. XTO Energy sells a significant portion of natural gas production from the underlying properties to certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries under contracts in existence when the trust was created, generally at amounts approximating monthly published prices.
