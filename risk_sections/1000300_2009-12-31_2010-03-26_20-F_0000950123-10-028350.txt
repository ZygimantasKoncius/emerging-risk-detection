D. Risk Factors An investment in the Companys American Depository Shares (ADS) and ordinary shares involves a degree of risk. The Companys risks have been organized into two main categories, these being:  risks associated with the gold mining industry; and  risks specific to the Company. Some of the risk factors outlined in this document may not typically be associated with investing in equity securities of companies from the United States and on this basis investors should carefully consider these risks when making an investment in the ADSs and ordinary shares of the Company. 1. Risks associated with the gold mining industry 1.1 The Companys profitability is dependent on gold prices determined by the market The market price for gold may fluctuate as a result of numerous factors beyond the Companys control, such as:  speculative positions taken by investors or traders in gold;  changes in global demand for gold (as an investment and/or for other uses);  expectations regarding inflation;  the strength of the US dollar (the currency in which gold trades internationally);  gold hedging by producers;  decisions made by central banks and multilateral organisations to purchase, hold or sell portions of their gold reserves; and  changes in production costs in major gold producing nations including South Africa, China and various countries located in the former Soviet Union. The potential supply of gold consists of new mine production, plus existing stocks of bullion and fabricated gold held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and individuals. In addition, the central banks of several countries and multilateral organizations sell their gold reserves onto the open market. For this reason a variation in annual gold production may not necessarily have a significant flow on effect onto the supply or price of gold for that particular year and there is no guarantee that additional open market sales of gold will not result in a downward pressure on the global gold price. If the gold price were to decline over an extended period below the price used by the Company in estimating its reserve calculations, then this could render ore reserves at certain operations uneconomic, and require a re-evaluation and/or downward adjustment of those ore reserves. In the past, gold mining companies have sought to mitigate, in part, the effect of gold price volatility, through hedging strategies which have included periodic purchases or sales of put or call options, spot deferred sales and forward sales covering a portion of its gold production at fixed future prices, however as at December 31, 2009, the Companys gold sales are entirely unhedged. The following table sets forth the high, low and average afternoon fixing prices for gold on the London Bullion Market (the London P.M. Fix) for the periods indicated. 11 Table of Contents Price in $ Per Ounce of Gold Year High Low Average 1988 484 395 437 1989 416 356 381 1990 424 346 384 1991 403 344 362 1992 360 330 344 1993 406 326 360 1994 396 370 384 1995 396 372 384 1996 415 367 397 1997 366 283 331 1998 313 273 294 1999 326 253 279 2000 313 264 279 2001 293 256 271 2002 349 278 310 2003 416 319 363 2004 454 375 409 2005 537 411 445 2006 725 525 603 2007 841 608 695 2008 1,011 712 872 2009 1,213 810 972 2010 (to February 28, 2010) 1,153 1,058 1,107 LGLs profitability is dependent on the price of gold. There are many factors outside the Companys control which determine the gold price and it is impossible for management to predict future movements in gold prices. 12 Table of Contents 1.2 Exploration and Developmental risk Exploration and mining activity is speculative in nature and requires a significant financial investment to fund the exploration drilling necessary to quantify the grades of mineralized material. If mineralization is discovered, it may take additional time and further financial investment to determine whether an ore reserve exists and commission a feasibility study for the project. Feasibility studies are based on additional assumptions regarding:  gold and other metal prices;  anticipated tonnage, grades and the unique characteristic of the ore;  anticipated recovery rates;  anticipated capital expenditure and cash operating costs; and  the estimated return on investment. Each assumption introduces an additional element of risk into this feasibility calculation. Similarly, a Companys ore reserve estimates are merely expressions of judgment based on knowledge, experience and industry practice, and may require revision when new information becomes available. Changes in the forecast price of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may alter the economic status of the reserves and may result in the restatement of those reserves. Such changes could impact on depreciation and amortisation rates, asset carrying values, deferred stripping calculations and provisions for environmental cleanup costs. In summary, no assurance can be given that the indicated amount of gold will be recovered or at the rates estimated. 1.3 Fluctuations in oil prices Oil-based products, fuels and consumables (including chemicals, explosives, heavy fuel oil and diesel) are a large operating cost to any mining company. Diesel fuel is used to power the mining equipment while heavy fuel oil is used to generate electrical power. Whilst the development of alternative power (eg: geothermal) reduces the dependence on heavy fuel oil, the Company remains vulnerable to the impact of increases in oil prices for diesel and for its remaining heavy fuel oil requirements (eg: lubricants). 1.4 High demand for input production factors Due to the increased demand for most mineral commodities experienced over the last few years, there has been significant demand for many mining and processing inputs. The Company, like most other mining and processing operations worldwide, has faced shortages and delays in the procurement of some required parts and supplies. These market pressures have been reflected in the cost and availability of certain inputs. The above shortages may also lead to delays in the commissioning of the Companys operations. Suppliers and contractors appointed by the Company may fail to perform adequately which could lead to further costs, and/or delays, as the Company appoints alternative suppliers and/or contractors. The construction and commissioning schedules will also rely on the timely completion of a number of critical activities any of which, if delayed, could cause construction and commissioning activities to be delayed. The Company cannot guarantee that no equipment will be rendered inoperative due to lack of parts supply, or that there will be no other adverse effects from the Companys inability to obtain other mining and processing inputs. 13 Table of Contents 1.5 Insurance may not address all operating risks The Companys mines, processing plants or related facilities could be forced to shut down or operations could otherwise be disrupted by a variety of risks and hazards, some of which may be outside the control of the Company. These include environmental hazards, industrial accidents, technical failures, labour disputes, unusual or unexpected rock formations, geothermal and seismic activity, flooding and extended interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions, fires, explosions and other accidents at the mine, processing plant or related facilities. These risks and hazards could also result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury, environmental damage, business interruption, monetary losses and possible legal liability. While the Company can maintain insurance with a range of coverage consistent with industry practice, no assurance can be given that this coverage can be maintained at reasonable rates or that any coverage it arranges will be adequate and available to cover any claims.
