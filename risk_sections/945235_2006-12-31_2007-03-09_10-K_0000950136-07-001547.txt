Item 1A. Risk Factors M & F Worldwide’s holding company structure could limit its ability to pay its expenses and dividends on its common stock. M & F Worldwide is a holding company whose only material assets are the stock of its subsidiaries, approximately $19.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $30.0 million in marketable securities as of December 31, 2006. M & F Worldwide conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries, Clarke American and Mafco Worldwide. M & F Worldwide’s ability to pay its expenses and dividends on its common stock depends on its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand and on the payment of dividends and tax sharing payments to it by Clarke American and Mafco Worldwide. Payments to M & F Worldwide by those subsidiaries, in turn, depend upon their consolidated results of operations and cash flows and whether they meet the criteria to make dividend payments under the instruments governing their indebtedness. The Company may not be able to integrate successfully Harland’s business, and the Company may not be able to achieve the cost savings or synergies it currently expects, which could have a material and adverse effect on its business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Although the Company and Harland each have acquired businesses in the past, the Company may not be able to integrate successfully Harland’s business after the closing of the Harland Acquisition. The Company will not be able to begin implementing its integration plan until the closing of the Harland Acquisition. The process of integrating acquired businesses involves numerous risks, including, among others: • difficulties in assimilating operations and products; • diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns to focus on new businesses and integration issues; • risks of operating businesses in which we have limited or no direct prior experience; • potential loss of key employees or of those of the acquired businesses; • potential exposure to unknown liabilities; and • possible loss of the Company’s clients or of those of the acquired businesses. In addition, it may cost more than the Company has anticipated to achieve such synergies, and the Company may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and synergies to the degree or within the timeframes it currently expects. The Company’s acquisition of Harland will also greatly increase the size of the Company, and it may be unable to manage the increase in scale successfully. Furthermore, the Company’s clients may not remain as its clients following the Harland Acquisition, and a number of Clarke American’s and Harland’s contracts are terminable upon short notice or at will. The acquisition of Harland is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, and approval by the shareholders of Harland. The Merger Agreement also provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances in volving a competing proposal, Harland may be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $52.5 million. If the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances due to a failure to obtain the requisite HSR Act clearance, the Company has agreed to pay Harland a termination fee of $52.5 million and up to an additional $12.0 million with respect to certain retention bonuses. The Company cannot assure you that all of the closing conditions to the Harland Acquisition will be satisfied or waived. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure you that it will consummate the Harland Acquisition. The failure to complete the Harland Acquisition, successfully integrate Harland, achieve anticipated synergies, or manage the increase in scale successfully or the loss of a significant number of our clients as a result of the Harland Acquisition could have a material and adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Compa ny will be able to refinance existing Clarke American and Harland indebtedness on terms as favorable to the Company as the existing indebtedness. 14 Table of Contents Risks Related to the Company’s Indebtedness The Company’s subsidiaries have substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect the subsidiaries’ ability to operate their respective businesses and prevent them from fulfilling their obligations under their respective debt agreements. On December 31, 2006, Clarke American had total indebtedness of approximately $603.8 million (including a principal balance of $4.6 million from a capital lease obligation and excluding $1.8 million of unamortized original discount), and $34.6 million of additional availability under the Clarke American revolving credit facility (after giving effect to the issuance of $5.4 million of letters of credit). On December 31, 2006, Mafco Worldwide had total indebtedness of approximately $88.9 million, and $13.5 million of additional availability under the Mafco Worldwide revolving credit facility (after giving effect to the issuance of $1.5 million of letters of credit). On December 31, 2006, the Company had total aggregate indebtedness of approximately $692.7 million and $48.1 million of aggregate additional availability under the Clarke American and Mafco Worldwide revolving credit facilities. The Company’s substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could: • make it more difficult for the Company’s subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations with respect to their respective indebtedness; • increase the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; • require the Company’s subsidiaries to dedicate a substantial portion of their cash flow from operations to payments on their indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of the subsidiaries’ cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes; • limit the Company’s subsidiaries’ flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in their respective businesses and industries; and • limit the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds. Holdings has advised the Company that it has pledged shares of M & F Worldwide common stock to secure obligations and that additional shares of M & F Worldwide common stock may from time to time be pledged to secure obligations of Holdings. A default under any of these obligations that are secured by the pledged shares could cause a foreclosure with respect to such shares of common stock. A foreclosure upon any such shares of common stock or dispositions of shares of common stock could, in a sufficient amount, constitute a ‘‘change of control’’ under the Company’s subsidiaries financing agreements, which would permit the Company’s lenders to accelerate amounts outstanding under such inde btedness. Clarke American’s and Mafco Worldwide’s ability to make payments on their indebtedness depends on their ability to generate sufficient cash in the future. Clarke American’s and Mafco Worldwide’s ability to make payments on their respective indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on their ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond the Company’s control. Clarke American’s term loan facility requires that a portion of Clarke American’s excess cash flow be applied to prepay amounts borrowed under the term loan. Clarke American is required to repay this facility in full in 2011. If Clarke American does not have sufficient cash to be able to make such mandatory payments and cannot refinance the unpaid portions of their term loan facility, Clarke American will be in default under its term loan facility. Clarke American is required to make mandatory payments under their term loan facility of $18.8 million in 2007, $28.1 million in 2008, $32.8 million in 2009, $37.5 million in 2010 and $281.4 million in 2011. These payments have been adjusted for the effe ct of the 2006 excess cash flow payment of $26.4 million that was paid in the first quarter of 2007. Clarke American’s revolving credit facility will mature on December 15, 2010. 15 Table of Contents Mafco Worldwide is required to make mandatory quarterly payments under its term loan facility of $275,000. In addition, Mafco Worldwide’s term loan facility requires that a portion of its excess cash flow be applied to prepay amounts borrowed under that facility (there are no such amounts to be paid with respect to 2006). Mafco Worldwide is required to repay this facility in full in December 2011. If Mafco Worldwide does not have sufficient cash to be able to make such mandatory prepayments and cannot refinance the unpaid portions of its term loan facility it will be in default under its credit facility. Mafco Worldwide’s revolving credit facility will mature on December 8, 2010. Clarke American and Mafco Worldwide may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to them under their respective credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable Clarke American or Mafco Worldwide to repay their debt or to fund their other liquidity needs. If Clarke American’s or Mafco Worldwide’s future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay their obligations as they mature or to fund their liquidity needs, Clarke American or Mafco Worldwide, as the case may be, may be forced to reduce or delay its business activities and capital expenditures, sell assets, obtain additional debt or equity capital or restructure or r efinance all or a portion of its debt on or before maturity. Clarke American or Mafco Worldwide, as the case may be, may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of Clarke American’s and Mafco Worldwide’s existing and future indebtedness may limit their respective ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Despite the Company’s subsidiaries’ current indebtedness levels, the Company and its subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. Additional indebtedness could exacerbate the risks associated with Clarke American’s and Mafco Worldwide’s substantial leverage. The Company and its subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of Clarke American’s credit facilities or notes and Mafco Worldwide’s credit facilities do not fully prohibit Clarke American or Mafco Worldwide from doing so. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, there was $34.6 million of additional availability under Clarke American’s $40.0 million revolving credit facility (after giving effect to the issuance of $5.4 million of letters of credit) and $13.5 million of additional availability under Mafco Worldwide’s $15.0 million revolving credit facility (after giving effect to the issuance of $1.5 million of letters of credit). If new indebtedness, including indebtedness incurred in connection with the financing of the acquisition of Harland, is added to the Company’s current debt levels, the related risks that it now faces could intensify. Covenant restrictions under the Company’s subsidiaries’ indebtedness may limit each subsidiary’s ability to operate its respective business. The indenture governing the senior notes issued by Clarke American and the agreements governing Clarke American’s and Mafco Worldwide’s respective credit facilities contain covenants that restrict Clarke American’s, Mafco Worldwide’s and their respective subsidiaries’ ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. The credit facilities and indenture governing the Clarke American notes restrict, among other things, such entities’ ability to: • incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; • make certain investments; • make restricted payments; • pay certain dividends or make other distributions; • incur liens; • enter into transactions with affiliates; and • merge or consolidate or transfer and sell assets. In addition, Clarke American’s and Mafco Worldwide’s respective credit facilities contain covenants requiring them to maintain financial ratios, including, with respect to Clarke American, a 16 Table of Contents maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio, a maximum total consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and with respect to Mafco Worldwide, a maximum total debt ratio and a minimum consolidated interest expense ratio. These restrictions may limit Clarke American’s and Mafco Worldwide’s ability to operate their respective businesses and may prohibit or limit their ability to enhance their operations or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Risks Related to Clarke American’s Business and Industry The paper check industry overall is a mature industry and check usage is declining. Clarke American’s business will be harmed if check usage declines faster than expected. Check and related products and services, including delivery services, account for most of Clarke American’s revenues. Check printing is, and is expected to continue to be, an essential part of Clarke American’s business and the principal source of Clarke American’s operating income. The check industry overall is a mature industry. The number of checks written in the U.S. has declined in recent years, and Clarke American believes that it will continue to decline due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, smart cards, automated teller machines, direct deposit, wire transfers, electronic and other bill paying services, home banking applications and Internet-based p ayment services. The actual rate and extent to which alternative payment methods will achieve consumer acceptance and replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. Changes in technology or the widespread adoption of current technologies may also make alternative payment methods more popular. An increase in the use of any of these alternative payment methods could have a material adverse effect on the demand for checks and a material adverse effect on Clarke American’s business, results of operations and prospects. Consolidation among financial institutions may adversely affect Clarke American’s relationships with its clients and Clarke American’s ability to sell its products and may therefore result in lower revenues and profitability. Mergers, acquisitions and personnel changes at financial institutions may adversely affect Clarke American’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In 2006, financial institutions accounted for approximately 84% of Clarke American’s revenues. In recent years, the number of financial institutions has declined due to consolidation. The increase in general negotiating leverage possessed by such consolidated entities also presents a risk that new and/or renewed contracts with these institutions may not be secured on terms as favorable as those historically negotiated with these clients. Consolidation among financial institutions could therefore decrease Clarke American’s revenues and profitability.< /p> Clarke American is dependent on a few large clients and adverse changes in its relationships with these highly concentrated clients may adversely affect its revenues and profitability. Clarke American’s sales have been, and very likely will continue to be, concentrated among a small group of clients. In 2006, Clarke American’s top 20 financial institution clients represented approximately 51% of its revenues, with sales to Bank of America representing a significant portion. Clarke American’s contract with Bank of America permits it to terminate the contract ‘‘for convenience’’ upon written notice or ‘‘for cause.’’ A significant decrease or interruption in business from Bank of America or from any of Clarke American’s other significant clients, or the termination of Clarke American’s contracts with any of its most significant clients, c ould have a material adverse effect on Clarke American’s revenues and profitability. Clarke American’s financial results can also be adversely affected by the business practices and actions of its large clients in a number of ways, including timing, size and mix of product orders and supply chain management. Several contracts with Clarke American’s significant clients expire over the next several years. Clarke American may not be able to renew them on terms favorable to Clarke American, or at all. The loss of one or more of these clients or a shift in the demand by, distribution 17 Table of Contents methods of, pricing to, or terms of sale to, one or more of these clients could materially adversely affect Clarke American. The write-off of any significant receivable due from delays in payment or return of products by any of Clarke American’s significant clients could also adversely impact Clarke American’s revenues and profitability. Clarke American faces intense competition which could result in lower revenues, higher costs and lower profitability. The check printing industry is intensely competitive. In addition to competition from alternative payment methods, Clarke American also faces considerable competition from other check printers. The principal factors on which Clarke American competes are service, convenience, quality, product range and price. Clarke American may not be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. Clarke American may not successfully implement its business strategies or realize all of its expected cost savings, which could reduce Clarke American’s revenues and profitability. Clarke American’s business strategies include strengthening relationships with clients, achieving substantial cost savings, making technology investments, rolling out procurement initiatives, reducing general and administrative expenses and corporate overhead and engaging in other process improvements designed to reduce fixed costs. Clarke American may not be able to fully implement these business strategies or realize, in whole or in part or within the time frames anticipated, the efficiency improvements or expected cost savings from these strategies. Clarke American’s strategies are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond its control. Additionally, Clarke American’s business strategies may change from time to time. As a result, Clarke American may not be able to achieve its expected results of operations. Interruptions or adverse changes in Clarke American’s vendor or supplier relationships or delivery services could have a material adverse effect on Clarke American’s business. Clarke American has strong relationships with many of the country’s largest paper mills and ink suppliers. These relationships afford Clarke American certain purchasing advantages, including stable supply and favorable pricing arrangements. Clarke American’s supplier arrangements are by purchase order and terminable at will at the option of either party. While Clarke American has been able to obtain sufficient paper supplies during recent paper shortages and otherwise, in part through purchases from foreign suppliers, Clarke American is subject to the risk that it will be unable to purchase sufficient quantities of paper to meet its production requirements during times of tight supply. Clarke American also relies on a single service provider for the maintenance of its digital printers. An interruption in its relationship with this service provider could compromise Clarke American’s ability to fulfill pending orders for checks and related products. Any interruption in supplies or service from these or other vendors or suppliers or delivery services could result in a disruption to Clarke American’s business if it is unable to readily find alternative service providers at comparable rates. Increased production and delivery costs, such as fluctuations in paper costs, could materially adversely affect Clarke American’s profitability. Increases in production costs such as paper and labor could adversely affect Clarke American’s profitability, business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, Clarke American’s principal raw material is paper. Any significant increase in paper prices as a result of a short supply or otherwise would adversely affect Clarke American’s costs. In addition, disruptions in parcel deliveries or increases in delivery rates, which are often tied to fuel prices, could also increase Clarke American’s costs. Clarke American’s contracts with its financial institution clients may contain certain restrictions on Clarke American’s ability to pass on to clients increased production costs or price increases. In addition, competitive pressures in the check industry may have the effect of inhibiting Clarke American’s ability to reflect these increased costs in the prices of its products and services. 18 Table of Contents Softness in direct mail response rates could have an adverse impact on Clarke American’s operating results. Clarke American’s Direct to Consumer segment has experienced declines in response and retention rates related to direct mail promotional materials. Clarke American believes that these declines are attributable to a number of factors, including the decline in check usage, the overall increase in direct mail solicitations received by Clarke American’s target customers, and the multi-box promotional strategies employed by Clarke American and its competitors. To offset these factors, Clarke American may have to modify and/or increase its marketing efforts, which could result in increased expense. The profitability of the Direct to Consumer segment depends in large part on Clarke American’s ability to secure adequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates, as well as the consumer response rates generated by such advertising. Suitable advertising media may not be available at a reasonable cost, or available at all. Furthermore, the advertising Clarke American utilizes may not be effective. Clarke American may not be able to sustain its current levels of profitability as a result. Clarke American depends upon the talents and contributions of a limited number of individuals, many of whom would be difficult to replace, and the loss or interruption of their services could materially and adversely affect Clarke American’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Clarke American has entered into employment agreements with certain members of its senior management team, including Charles Dawson, Clarke American’s President and Chief Executive Officer. However, the service of these individuals may not continue or Clarke American may not be able to find individuals to replace them at the same cost to Clarke American or at all. The loss or interruption of the services of these executives could have a material adverse effect on Clarke American’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Account data breaches involving stored client data or misuse of such data could adversely affect Clarke American’s reputation, revenues and growth. Clarke American, its customers, and other third parties store customer account information relating to Clarke American’s checks. Any breach of the systems on which sensitive customer data and account information are stored or archived and any misuse by Clarke American’s own employees, by employees of data archiving services or by other unauthorized users of such data could lead to fraudulent activity involving Clarke American’s customers and Clarke American’s financial institution clients’ customers’ information and/or funds, damage the reputation of Clarke American’s brands and result in claims against Clarke American. If Clarke American is unsuccessful in defending any lawsuit involving such data security breaches or misuse, it may be forced to pay damages, which could materially and adversely affect its profitability and could have a material adverse impact on Clarke American’s transaction volumes, revenue and future growth prospects. In addition, such breaches could adversely affect Clarke American’s financial institution clients’ perception of Clarke American’s reliability, and could lead to the termination of client relationships. Legislation and contracts relating to consumer privacy protection could limit or harm Clarke American’s future business. Clarke American is subject to the federal financial modernization law known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the regulations implementing its privacy and information security requirements, as well as other privacy and data security federal and state laws and regulations. Clarke American is also subject to additional privacy and information security requirements in many of its contracts with financial institution clients, which are often more restrictive than the regulations. These laws, regulations and agreements require Clarke American to develop and implement policies to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers’ nonpublic personal information and to disclose these policies to consumers before a customer relat ionship is established and periodically thereafter. The laws, regulations, and agreements limit Clarke American’s ability to use its direct to consumer data in Clarke American’s other businesses and limit its ability to share customer information. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act does not prohibit state legislation or regulations that are more restrictive on Clarke American’s use of data. More restrictive legislation or regulations have been 19 Table of Contents introduced in the past and could be introduced in the future in Congress and the states. For example, legislation has been proposed that would require consumers to opt-in to any plan that would allow their nonpublic personal information to be disclosed. Clarke American is unable to predict whether more restrictive legislation or regulations will be adopted in the future. Any future legislation or regulations could have a negative impact on its business, results of operations or prospects. Additionally, future contracts may impose even more stringent requirements on Clarke American, which could increase its operating costs, as well as interfere with the cost savings Clarke American is trying to achieve. New laws and regulations may be adopted in the future with respect to the Internet, e-commerce or marketing practices generally relating to consumer privacy. Such laws or regulations may impede the growth of the Internet and/or use of other sales or marketing vehicles. As an example, new privacy laws could decrease traffic to Clarke American’s websites, decrease telemarketing opportunities and decrease the demand for Clarke American’s products and services. Additionally, the applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing property ownership, taxation, libel and personal privacy is uncertain and may remain uncertain for a considerable length of time. Clarke American may be unable to protect its rights in intellectual property, and third-party infringement or misappropriation may materially adversely affect its profitability. Despite Clarke American’s efforts to protect its intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate Clarke American’s intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products and services. In addition, the sale of products bearing trademarks or designs licensed from third parties accounts for a significant portion of Clarke American’s revenues. These license agreements typically provide for the retention of ownership of the tradename, know-how or other intellectual property by the licensor and the payment of a royalty to the licensor. In general, the term of each license is short, between two and three years, and some licenses may be terminated upon a change of c ontrol. Such licenses may not be available to Clarke American indefinitely or on terms that would allow it to continue to sell the licensed products profitably. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm Clarke American’s business and ability to compete. Clarke American relies on a combination of trademark, copyright and patent laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements to protect its trademarks, copyrights, software, inventions, trade secrets, know-how and other intellectual property. Clarke American may be required to spend significant resources to protect its trade secrets and monitor and police its intellectual property rights. Third parties may assert infringement claims against Clarke American in the future. In particular, there has been a substantial increase in the issuance of patents for Internet-related systems and business methods, which may have broad implications for participants in online commerce. Claims for infringement of these patents are increasingly becoming a subject of litigation. If Clarke American becomes subject to an infringement claim, it may be required to modify its products, services and technologies or obtain a license to permit its continued use of those rights. Clarke American may not be able to do either of these things in a timely manner or upon reasonable terms and conditions. Failure to do so could seriously harm Clarke A merican’s business, operating results and prospects as a result of lost business, increased expenses or being barred from offering its products or implementing its systems or business methods. In addition, future litigation relating to infringement claims could result in substantial costs to Clarke American and a diversion of management resources. Adverse determinations in any litigation or proceeding could also subject Clarke American to significant liabilities and could prevent Clarke American from using some of its products, services or technologies. Clarke American is dependent upon third-party providers for significant information technology needs, and an interruption of services from these providers could materially adversely affect Clarke American’s operations. Clarke American has entered into agreements with third-party providers for the licensing of certain software and the provision of information technology services, including software development 20 Table of Contents and support services, and personal computer, telecommunications, network server and help desk services. In the event that one or more of these providers is not able to provide adequate information technology services or terminates a license or service, Clarke American would be adversely affected. Although Clarke American believes that information technology services and substantially equivalent software and services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform or a termination by one or more of its service providers could cause a disruption in Clarke American’s business while it obtains an alternative source of supply and Clarke American may not be able to find such an alternative source on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Clarke American may experience processing errors or software defects that could harm its business and reputation. Clarke American uses sophisticated software and computing systems to process check orders for its customers. Clarke American may experience difficulties in installing or integrating its technologies on platforms used by its clients. Furthermore, certain financial institution clients have integrated their systems with Clarke American’s, permitting Clarke American’s operators to effect certain operations directly into its financial institution clients’ customers’ accounts. Errors or delays in the processing of check orders, software defects or other difficulties could result in: • loss of clients; • additional development costs; • diversion of technical and other resources; • negative publicity; or • exposure to liability claims. Clarke American faces uncertainty with respect to future acquisitions and unsuitable or unsuccessful acquisitions could materially adversely affect Clarke American’s profitability. Clarke American has acquired complementary businesses in the past and may pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses in the future. Clarke American cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be acquired on acceptable terms or whether future acquisitions, even if completed, will be successful. Future acquisitions by Clarke American could result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities, debt or amortization expenses relating to intangible assets which could materially adversely affect Clarke American’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, the success of any acquisition will depend upon Clarke American’s ability to integrate effectively the acquired businesses. The pro cess of integrating acquired businesses may involve numerous risks, including, among others: • difficulties in assimilating operations and products; • diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; • risks of operating businesses in which Clarke American has limited or no direct prior experience; • potential loss of Clarke American’s key employees or of those of the acquired businesses; • potential exposure to unknown liabilities; and • possible loss of Clarke American’s clients or of those of the acquired businesses. Clarke American cannot predict whether any acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to Clarke American’s revenues or earnings to any material extent. Clarke American may be subject to sales and other taxes, which could have adverse effects on its business. In accordance with current federal, state and local tax laws, and the constitutional limitations thereon, Clarke American currently collects sales, use or other similar taxes in state and local 21 Table of Contents jurisdictions where Clarke American has a physical presence. One or more state or local jurisdictions may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on Clarke American and other out-of-state companies which engage in remote or online commerce. Several U.S. states have taken various initiatives to prompt retailers to collect local and state sales taxes on purchases made over the Internet. Furthermore, tax law and the interpretation of constitutional limitations thereon are subject to change. In addition, any new operation of these businesses in states where they do not currently have a physical presence could subject shipments of goods by these businesses into such states to sales tax under current or future laws. If one or more state or local jurisdictions successfully asserts that Clarke American must collect sales or other taxes beyond its current practices, it could have a material, adverse affect on Clarke American’s business. Clarke American may be subject to environmental risks, and liabilities for environmental compliance or cleanup could have a material, adverse effect on Clarke American’s profitability. Clarke American’s plants are subject to many existing and proposed federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. Enforcement of these laws may require the expenditure of material amounts for environmental compliance or cleanup. Clarke American has sold former plants to third parties. In some instances, Clarke American has agreed to indemnify the buyer of the facility for certain environmental liabilities. Clarke American may also be subject to liability under environmental laws for environmental conditions at those former facilities or other locations where Clarke American’s wastes have been disposed. Although Clarke American is not aware of any fact or circumstance which would require the expenditure of material amounts for environmental compliance or cleanup, if environmental liabilities are discovered at its current or former printing plants, Clarke American could be required to spend material amounts for environmental compliance or cleanup. Risks Relating to Mafco Worldwide’s Business and Industry Mafco Worldwide’s business is heavily dependent on sales to the worldwide tobacco industry, and negative developments and trends within the tobacco industry could have a material adverse effect on Mafco Worldwide’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In 2006, approximately 71% of Mafco Worldwide’s licorice sales and 10% of the Company’s consolidated net revenues were to the worldwide tobacco industry for use as tobacco flavor enhancing and moistening agents in the manufacture of American blend cigarettes, moist snuff, chewing tobacco and pipe tobacco. Negative developments and trends within the tobacco industry, such as those described below, could have a material adverse effect on Mafco Worldwide’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Consumption of tobacco products worldwide has declined steadily for years. Worldwide consumption of American blend cigarettes has declined approximately 2% to 3% per year for the past five years. Manufacturers of cigarettes are subject to regulation in the U.S. at the federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries. Changing public attitudes toward tobacco products, a constant expansion of tobacco regulations in a number of countries and an increase in excise and other taxes on cigarettes have all contributed to this worldwide decline in consumption. U.S. production of chewing tobacco products has declined steadily for more than a decade. This decline has been partially offset by an increase in moist snuff volumes. The tobacco industry has been the subject of increased governmental regulation in recent years, and this trend is likely to continue. Producers of tobacco products are subject to regulation in the U.S. at the federal, state and local levels. There has been a constant expansion of tobacco regulations in the U.S. since the early 1970s and this trend is likely to continue. Restrictive foreign tobacco legislation has been on the rise in recent years as well, including restrictions on where tobacco may be sold and used, warning labels and other graphic packaging images and product constituent limitations. The sale and use of tobacco 22 Table of Contents products has been subject to opposition from government and health officials in the U.S. for more than 40 years, and more recently in other countries due to claims that tobacco consumption is harmful to an individual’s health. In addition, the World Health Organization has identified smoking as a significant world health risk. These claims have resulted in a number of substantial restrictions on the marketing, advertising, sale and use of cigarettes and other tobacco products, in diminished social acceptability of smoking and in activities by anti-tobacco groups designed to inhibit tobacco product sales. The effects of these claims together with substantial increases in state, federal and foreign regulation of tobacco products have resulted in lower tobacco consumption, which is likely to continue in the future, and could have a material adverse effect on Mafco Worldwide’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The tobacco industry has been the subject of substantial litigation. There has been substantial litigation between tobacco product manufacturers and individuals, various governmental units and private health care providers regarding increased medical expenditures and losses allegedly caused by use of tobacco products. As a result of settlements of some of this litigation in the U.S., the cigarette companies in the U.S. significantly increased the wholesale price of cigarettes in order to recoup the cost of the settlements. At this time Mafco Worldwide is unable to determine whether additional price increases in the future will reduce tobacco consumption or the effect of reduced consumption on its financial performance. Health-related litigation against the tobacco industry may increase, and Mafco W orldwide, as a supplier to the tobacco industry, may become party to such litigation regardless of the merit of any claim. This litigation, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on Mafco Worldwide’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Federal, state, local and foreign excise tax increases on tobacco products are likely to reduce demand for tobacco products. In recent years, federal, state, local and foreign governments have increased or proposed increases to excise taxes on tobacco products as a means of both raising revenue and discouraging the consumption of such products. Substantial increases in excise taxes on tobacco products have reduced, and are likely to continue to reduce, the demand for tobacco products, which could have a material adverse effect on Mafco Worldwide’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in consumer preferences could decrease Mafco Worldwide’s revenues and cash flow. Mafco Worldwide is subject to the risks of evolving consumer preferences and nutritional and health-related concerns. A portion of Mafco Worldwide’s revenues are derived from the sale of licorice to worldwide confectioners. To the extent that consumer preferences shift away from licorice flavored candy, operating results relating to the sale of licorice to worldwide confectioners could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on Mafco Worldwide’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a portion of Mafco Worldwide’s revenues are derived from the sale of licorice derivatives to food processors for use as flavoring or masking agents, including Mafco Worldwide&r squo;s Magnasweet brand flavor enhancer, which is used in various brands of chewing gum, lip balm, energy bars, non-carbonated beverages, chewable vitamins, aspirin, and other products and is identified in the U.S. as a natural flavor. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products that use licorice derivatives, operating results relating to the sale of licorice derivatives could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on Mafco Worldwide’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Mafco Worldwide is subject to transportation risks. An extended interruption in Mafco Worldwide’s ability to ship or distribute products could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. While the Company believes Mafco Worldwide is adequately insured, the Company cannot be sure that Mafco Worldwide would be able to transport its products by alternative means if it were to experience an interruption due to strike, natural disasters or otherwise, in a timely and cost-effective manner. Mafco Worldwide’s failure to accurately forecast and manage inventory could result in an unexpected shortfall or surplus of its products which could harm its business. Mafco Worldwide monitors its inventory levels based on its own projections of future demand. Because of the length of time necessary to harvest licorice root and produce licorice products, Mafco Worldwide must make production decisions well in advance of sales.

Risks Relating to the Company’s Contingent Liabilities The failure of Pneumo Abex’s indemnitors and insurers to pay their obligations timely and substantially in full could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Pneumo Abex has no operating business or regular source of revenue and is therefore dependent on its indemnitors and insurers for payment of obligations arising out of the defense and resolution of third-party claims asserted against it. Based upon the indemnitors’ active management of indemnifiable matters, discharging of the related liabilities when required, and financial positions based upon publicly filed financial statements, as well as the history of insurance recovery, the Company believes that the likelihood of failing to obtain reimbursement of amounts covered by insurance and indemnification is remote, although there can be no assurance.
