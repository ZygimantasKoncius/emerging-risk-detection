Risk FactorsRisks relating to operations outside of ChileOur Venezuela operations are subject to adverse political and economic conditions. VENEZUELA PRINCIPAL WOOD PRODUCTS SALES Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$) 2003 2004 2005 Solid Wood and Forestry Sawn lumber $ 2.6 $ 7.3 $ 14.9 Boards MDF 13.6 24.1 37.0 Particle board $ 6.2 $ 7.6 $ 9.1 Marketing and distribution We sell most of our products in Venezuela through approximately 74 independent distributors serving the furniture manufacturing and construction industries. Our 20 largest solid wood and forestry product customers, in terms of sales revenue, accounted for approximately 86% and 80% of our solid wood and forestry sales in Venezuela for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our largest solid wood and forestry products customer accounted for approximately 12% and 11% of such sales, respectively. Our principal solid wood products customers in Venezuela are Madera La Ojedeña C.A., Grupo Imeca, and Madenova C.A. 35 Table of Contents Our 20 largest board product customers, in terms of sales revenue, accounted for approximately 95% and 79% of our board sales in Venezuela for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our largest board products customer accounted for approximately 22% and 12% of such sales, respectively. Our principal board products customers in Venezuela are Grupo Imeca, Madenova C.A., and Aserradero El Sol C.A.. Although we do not believe that, under current market conditions, the loss of any one distributor or customer would have a material adverse effect on us, there can be no assurance that any such loss in the future will not have such a material adverse effect. Our products are stored in two warehouses, at our Macapaima plant and in Puerto Cabello and are shipped mainly by truck to domestic customer locations. We also have a sales office in Caracas, Venezuela. The wood products we sell in the Venezuelan market are produced at our Fibranova-Macapaima plant in Anazoñtegui, Venezuela. In 2004 and 2005, Masisa successfully expanded its Placacentros network in Venezuela. Masisa Venezuela has opened 18 stores throughout the country as of December 31, 2005, and expects to grow its network with approximately 10 new stores in Venezuela during 2006. Solid wood and forestry Sawn lumber market. We sell sawn lumber to distributors and pallet manufacturers and other industries in Venezuela. Our total sales of sawn lumber for the year ended December 31, 2005 were US$14.9 million compared to US$7.3 million for the same period in 2004. This increase is primarily due to a decrease in demand for native timber species that compete with our lumber, which come from man-made plantations, for market share and an increase in demand by pallet manufacturers for the food industry. All of the sawn lumber we sell in Venezuela is harvested at our plantations in the Uverito area, and processed at our Andinos sawmill, in the Macapaima complex in Anazoátegui, Venezuela. The sawn lumber market in Venezuela had historically been dominated by wood species native to Venezuela and imported radiata pine from Chile. Caribbean pine wood is relatively new to the Venezuelan market but is growing fast due to its high quality and demand for quality wood from the construction and pallet manufacturing industries. We believe demand from pallet manufacturers will be more important in the coming years due to the fact that the distribution industries are increasingly converting to palletized systems and new regulations in packaging. Our principal competitors in this market are smaller volume local sawmills including Pinoven, Forestal Soledad and Aserradero Carabobo. Boards MDF market. We sell MDF to distributors in Venezuela. Our total MDF sales in 2005 were US$37.0 million compared to US$24.1 million for the same period in 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher prices and physical volume sales resulting from improved domestic economic conditions. All of the MDF board we sell in Venezuela is produced at our Fibranova-Macapaima plant in Anzoátegui, Venezuela. We believe we have an advantage in this market as a domestic competitor. We also believe sales through Placacentros will enable us to grow sales significantly. Particle board market. Our businesses sell raw and melamine-coated particle board to distributors in Venezuela. Our total particle board sales in 2005 were US$9.1 million compared to US$7.6 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher prices and physical volume sales resulting from improved domestic economic conditions. All of the particle board we sell in Venezuela is produced at our Fibranova-Macapaina plant in Anzoátegui, Venezuela. Sales of particle board in Venezuela declined greatly in 2002 and 2003 as a result of economic instability and a general economic recession. The market began to improve in 2004, and continued this trend in 2005 and we are focusing on developing our boards and melamine products. 36 Table of Contents Argentina General For the 12 months ended December 31, 2005, GDP grew 9.2%, inflation was 9.6% and the trade balance surplus was US$11.3 billion. At December 31, 2005, the unemployment rate was 11.6% . The Argentinean economy showed strong growth in the period after several years of economic crisis. After depreciating by 237% in 2002, the Argentinean peso appreciated moderately in 2003 and has since stabilized. Additionally, most of the restrictions on cash withdrawals from bank accounts and on transfers of funds from Argentinean to foreign accounts that were imposed during the 2002 economic crisis had been lifted by the end of 2003. In June 2005, the government finished the process of renegotiating most of its defaulted debt. As a result, Argentinas risk ratings improved. Although 2003 and 2004 demonstrated that the economic situation in Argentina has improved, no assurance can be given that governmental measures or other factors will continue to improve Argentinas economy or that general improvement in its economy will lead to an increase in the demand for particle board and/or MDF. The following table shows our MDF, particle board, OSB and MDF mouldings sales in the Argentinean market for the periods indicated. ARGENTINA PRINCIPAL WOOD PRODUCTS SALES Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$) 2003 2004 2005 Boards MDF $ 14.7 $ 21.4 $ 28.1 Particle board 10.6 15.8 20.5 OSB 1.6 1.9 2.2 MDF mouldings $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ 0.3 Marketing and distribution We sell particle board and MDF to Argentinean furniture manufacturers through approximately 150 distributors. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, approximately 70% and 69% of Masisas sales revenue in the Argentinean market was generated by the 20 principal distributors. The largest customer accounted for approximately 10% and 9%, respectively, of these sales during such periods. Masisas principal distributors in Argentina are Cencosud S.A., Distribuidora Aglolam S.A., Madergold S.A., Distribuidora Argentina de Chapas S.A.C., Distribuidora Placasur S.A., Sacheco S.A., Dolinsky S.A., NBC Maderas S.R.L., Trumar S.A.I.C. and Amiano S.R.L.. Given the successful development of Masisas Placacentro program in Chile and Peru, Masisa Argentina started to develop this distribution channel in 2000. 42 stores were opened in Argentina as of December 31, 2005. Masisa Argentina expects to grow its network with approximately 7 stores in Argentina in 2006. Of Masisas sales in Argentina during 2005 and during 2004, approximately 42% were through Placacentros for each year. We are pursuing several strategies in Argentina to encourage the use of Masisas particle board and MDF products in lieu of other materials. As in Chile, Masisa holds regular meetings with Argentinean furniture manufacturers, offers service and technical assistance to these consumers and regularly participates in trade fairs and furniture shows. In addition, Masisa offers technical training courses for Masisa-product installers. We have focused our marketing efforts on furniture and cabinet manufacturers and on the construction industry. After the devaluation of the Argentinean peso in 2002 and in response to the adverse macroeconomic scenario in Argentina, Masisa Argentina redirected the majority of production from its Argentinean operations to export markets primarily in Brazil, Mexico, the United States and the Far East. However, with the recovery of the Argentinean local market, this trend has been reversed. 37 Table of Contents MDF Market. We have continued to actively develop the market for this product through advertising campaigns, events held directly with our customers and our participation in trade shows, all of which are designed to demonstrate the boards quality and multiple uses for furniture manufacturers, architects and decorators. Masisa is the largest MDF manufacturer in the Argentinean market. Our total MDF board sales in 2005 were US$28.1 million compared to US$21.4 million in 2004. The increase was due primarily to higher volume sales and prices as a result of strong demand in 2005. The large increase in sales in 2003 followed a steep decline in 2002, when, in order to minimize the impact of the devaluation, Masisa Argentina shifted the main part of its domestic sales of MDF to exports. The Argentinean MDF market was a fast-growing market that we estimate expanded approximately 530% between 1995 and 1999. However, the economic crisis of 2002 adversely affected the market. In 2003 and 2004, the market expanded rapidly compared to 2002. We believe the positive growth trend in the economy will continue in the short-term and that the market for wood board products will continue to recover as a result. However, there can be no assurance that the economy will continue to recover or that sales of wood board products will increase as a result. In the first half of 2002, Alto Paraná (Paneles Arauco) began operations at its new MDF plant in Argentina. In addition to Alto Paraná, there is only one other competitor in this market, Tableros Guillermina S.A. Particle Board Market. Argentina has more than twice the population of Chile and has a significant housing deficit. However, following the devaluation of its currency on January 2002, Argentinas per capita income was reduced to half of its pre-devaluation levels. The low per capita consumption is primarily the result of this economic crisis. As Argentinas economy has recovered, demand for Masisas products has begun to recover as well. We expect that future demand for Masisas products in Argentina will be largely dependent upon the growth of the Argentinean economy and particularly on the growth of the Argentinean construction and furniture manufacturing industries. Masisa is one of the three largest particle board manufacturers in the Argentinean market. Masisas principal Argentinean competitors in particle board are Faplac S.A., Sadepan Latinoamericana S.A. and Cuyoplacas S.A. The other smaller Argentinean particle board producers, such as Tableros del Paraná S.A. have a minimal market presence and use older and less efficient technology than Masisa utilizes at its Concordia facility. We also believe Masisas cost of production is lower than that of its Argentinean competitors. As in Chile, however, particle board products compete with other types of board products, such as gypsum, as well as solid wood and plywood. Our total particle board sales in 2005 increased to US$20.5 million compared to US$15.8 million in 2004, due to strong demand. The large increases in sales in 2005, 2004, and 2003 follow a steep decline in 2002, when, in order to minimize the impact of the devaluation, Masisa Argentina shifted the main part of its domestic sales of particle board to exports. Other markets Colombia We sell particle board and MDF products into the Colombian market mainly through exports from Venezuela. Our particle board sales in Colombia increased by 79% from US$6.0 million in 2004 to US$10.6 million in 2005. The growth of such sales was principally due to strong demand for particle boards. Our MDF board sales in Colombia increased by 23% in dollar terms, from US$9.5 million in 2004 to US$11.7 million in 2005. As in the case of particle board, the increase in MDF board sales was principally due to strong demand. As of December 31, 2005, 21 Placacentros stores have been opened in Colombia. We expect to grow the network with approximately 13 new stores in Colombia during 2006. Peru We sell particle board and MDF products into the Peruvian market mainly through exports from Chile. We established our Peruvian subsidiary, Masisa Peru, in 1999 to conduct commercial and distribution activities in that country. 38 Table of Contents Our board sales in Peru increased by 37% from US$11.6 million in 2004 to US$15.9 million in 2005. The increase in board sales was principally due to deeper market penetration of MDF board products, and strong demand for particle board. As of December 31, 2005, 21 Placacentros stores have been opened in Peru. We expect to grow the network with approximately 2 new stores in Peru during 2006. Other Our board businesses generally achieve higher margins from the sale of their principal products in the markets in which they participate directly (Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Mexico) than from exports through third parties. Accordingly, our board businesses have traditionally preferred to satisfy demand in these markets first, and then export any surplus products. However, we have built a solid business network outside the markets in which we directly participate in order to diversify our market risk and to enable us to respond promptly to changes in market conditions in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Mexico. After the political and economic crisis began in Argentina in 2002, we utilized this export network and experience to substitute sales to foreign markets for lost sales in the Argentinean market. This was possible as a result of the increased competitiveness of products produced in Argentina resulting from the currency devaluation in that country. Approximately 10.6% of our total consolidated revenues in 2005 were derived from U.S., Chilean, Mexican, Brazilian, Venezuelan and Argentinean export sales to markets other than the United States, Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina, compared to the approximately 11.1% represented by such sales in 2004. Production We own and operate production facilities in Chile, Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, the United States and Mexico. Our Chilean production facilities are located in Cabrero, Coronel, Chiguayante, Valdivia and Chillán. Our Venezuelan production facilities are located in Macapaima, near the city of Puerto Ordaz in the southern part of the state of Anzoátegui. Our Brazilian production facilities are located in Rio Negrinho in the State of Santa Catarina and Ponta Grossa in the State of Paraná. Our Argentinean production facilities are located in Concordia, in the province of Entre Rios. Our U.S. production facilities are located in Wando (Charleston), South Carolina. Our Mexican production facilities are located in Durango, in the state of Nuevo León. 39 Table of Contents Our production by country Chile The following table shows the product and the installed annual production capacity in cubic meters as of December 31, 2005, for each of our Chilean production lines. CHILE WOOD PRODUCTS PRODUCTION LINES Plant Line Product Annual installed capacity(1) Cabrero (Solid wood) Sawmill Various 337,000 Finger-joint mouldings Finger-joint mouldings 103,000 Cabrero (Boards) MDF MDF 160,000 MDF mouldings MDF mouldings 72,000 Chiguayante (Boards) Line 1 Particle board 82,000 Laminating Melamine board 45,000 Chillán (Solid wood) Doors Solid wood doors 42,000 Mapal (Boards) Line 1 Particle board 95,000 Line 2 Particle board 60,000 MDF MDF 140,000 Laminating Melamine board 110,000 Puschmann (Boards) Line 1 Particle board 86,000 Valdivia (Boards) Line 1 Particle board 90,000 Laminating Melamine board 50,000 Veneering Wood-veneered board 40,000 Doors Fiberboard doors 500,000 _______________________ (1) Units are in cubic meters, except fiberboard doors, which are in square meters. The annual installed capacity may vary slightly depending upon the thickness of the boards produced and other production factors. Actual production can exceed capacity because capacity is estimated assuming an average board thickness and actual board thickness may vary. Cabrero (Solid Wood). Our Cabrero solid wood facilities are located in city of Cabrero, Chile. Its operations include a sawmill and wood drying unit and plants for the production of finger-joint mouldings and solid wood doors. Sawmill. Our sawmill in Cabrero was constructed during 2000 and reached full operational capacity in May of 2001. It was constructed to replace our then-existing Cabrero sawmill which we had operated for 15 years and which we still partially operate. The new mill is a state-of-the-art facility equipped with a software control system that provides automatic control of the production line and allows for a high speed production line. The software system also uses special scanners and sensors for the cutting of wood and offers automatic packaging. With this new equipment, the volume of processed wood has increased to 106.8 cubic meters per hour, and the yield of wood per log has increased by 1%. Maintenance costs have also increased due to the technological change, but the labor requirement has fallen from around 180 people to approximately 52 people. Since the sawmill entered into full operation, it has increased wood processing volumes and volumetric output with a corresponding decrease in byproducts production. The mill currently has a maximum annual yield of 337,000 cubic meters of sawn wood, the majority of which is used in the production of finger-joint mouldings and solid wood doors. The solid wood industrial complexes also include drying facilities in Cabrero. Their annual operational capacity is sufficient to dry most saw lumber currently produced at the Cabrero sawmill. This enables us to manufacture our wood products with kiln-dried wood with a moisture content of 12% or less. 40 Table of Contents Finger-joint moulding plant. The finger-joint moulding plant has an annual production capacity of approximately 103,000 cubic meters. We designed and constructed this plant to produce high-quality linear mouldings and doorframes of various styles intended for use in interior architecture. Within these product lines, we manufacture products meeting a variety of standardized design specifications as well as custom made products designed and finished according to specifications supplied by our customers. Cabrero (Boards). This plant has been operating since August 1992. It has a single MDF board line with an annual production capacity of 160,000 cubic meters. Additionally, in order to produce a greater quantity of value added products, we added an MDF moulding line with an annual production capacity of 34,000 cubic meters which began production in June 2004. In August 2005, a new MDF moulding line was added to this facility, doubling our production capacity to 72,000 cubic meters per year. Mapal. Our Mapal industrial site, which is located in Coronel near the city of Concepción, 320 miles south of Santiago, has two particle board lines, one MDF line and one melamine-laminating line, which includes a melamine impregnating line. The two particle board production lines have an aggregate annual production capacity of approximately 155,000 cubic meters: one for thin particle board (60,000 cubic meters per year capacity) and another for thicker boards (95,000 cubic meters per year capacity). The MDF line commenced operations in January 1996, and has a production capacity of approximately 140,000 cubic meters of MDF per year. The melamine paper impregnating line produces most of the melamine paper used by our melamine-laminating lines. The Mapal facility laminates a portion of its total particle board and MDF production. A new melamine-laminating line in the Mapal plant began full operations in 2003, with an annual production capacity of 110,000 cubic meters, replacing the former line. We increased melamine production capacity through this new line in response to an increase in demand generated by our developing Placacentros network as well as an anticipated increase in demand for such boards in our Chilean and export markets. Chiguayante. Our Chiguayante facility is located 16 miles from our Mapal facility. The Chiguayante facility has a single particle board line with an annual production capacity of approximately 82,000 cubic meters. We upgraded the facility in 1994 so that particle board manufactured at Chiguayante would be similar in quality to that produced at the Mapal facility. The Chiguayante plant also has a melamine-laminating line with an annual production capacity of approximately 45,000 cubic meters. Chillán. The door plant, located in the city of Chillán, has an annual production capacity of approximately 42,000 cubic meters of solid wood doors. This plant was designed to manufacture products primarily for the United States and other North American markets. Its principal products are solid raised-panel pine wood interior stile and rail doors. We produce our solid wood doors in a range of widths and market them for use as interior and closet doors. The stiles and rails are composed of a finger-jointed center and face made of laminated clear pine and thin MDF boards. The panels are edge-glued solid wood pieces with a double-hip profile. This structure gives the door substantial stability. Valdivia and Puschmann. We have two production complexes in Valdivia, a city located approximately 520 miles south of Santiago. The main facility is referred to as the Valdivia plant and has an annual production capacity of approximately 90,000 cubic meters of particle board. The second facility is named Puschmann, in memory of Carlos Puschmann, a distinguished Masisa employee who passed away in 1999. Masisa acquired the Puschmann plant in August 1998 when it purchased the assets of Tableros Nobel S.A. (Nobel), which was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Infodema S.A. (lnfodema), for US$17.0 million. The Valdivia plants machinery employs a particle board production process similar to that used at our facilities in Mapal and Concordia, Argentina. In addition to producing raw particle board, the Valdivia plant produces melamine-laminated boards, wood-veneered particle board and all of the fiberboard doors and wood veneer strips produced by Masisa in Chile. Additionally, the melamine-laminating line purchased from Infodema was moved to Masisas Valdivia plant and has been operating at full capacity since February 1999. 41 Table of Contents The melamine-laminating line and the wood-veneering line have estimated annual production capacities of 50,000 cubic meters and 40,000 cubic meters, respectively. Our fiberboard door production line is located in the same facility and has an estimated annual production capacity of 500,000 square meters. The capacity utilization rate for our sawmill production facilities in Chile was 100% in 2005, compared to 92% in 2004 and 99% in 2003. The capacity utilization rate for our finger-joint moulding production facilities in Chile was 86% in 2005, compared to 93% in 2004 and 94% in 2003. The capacity utilization rate for our solid wood doors production facilities in Chile was 93% in 2005, compared to 88% in 2004 and 90% in 2003. The capacity utilization rate for our particle board production facilities in Chile was 87% in 2005, compared to 83% in 2004 and 75% in 2003. The capacity utilization rate for our MDF production facilities in Chile was 100% in 2005, compared to 103% in 2004 and 94% in 2003. The capacity utilization rate for our MDF moulding production facilities in Chile, that started production in June 2004, was 64% for 2005, compared to 82% for the second half of 2004. This decline in the capacity utilization rate reflects new MDF moulding capacity added in August, 2005. Actual production can exceed capacity because capacity is estimated assuming an average board thickness and actual board thickness may vary. Planned Facilities. We began the construction of a new MDF plant in Chile in early 2006 and estimate construction of the plant will be completed during 2007. The plan calls for the new plant to have an estimated annual production capacity of 340,000 cubic meters once it is completed and to cost an estimated US$82.0 million. It is intended for the new plants production to be destined principally for export. Brazil The following table shows, for each of our Brazilian production lines, the product manufactured and the installed annual production capacity in cubic meters as of December 31, 2005. BRAZIL WOOD PRODUCTS PRODUCTION LINES Annual installed Plant Line Product capacity(1) Ponta Grossa (Boards) Line 1 MDF 240,000 OSB OSB 300,000 Laminating Melamine board 220,000 Rio Negrinho (Solid wood) Finger-joint mouldings Finger-joint mouldings 65,000 Sawmill Various 220,000 _______________________ (1) Units are in cubic meters. The annual installed capacity may vary slightly depending upon the thickness of the boards produced and other production factors. Actual production can exceed capacity because capacity is estimated assuming an average board thickness and actual board thickness may vary. Ponta Grossa. In December 2000, we finished the construction of our MDF production facility in the city of Ponta Grossa, in the State of Paraná, Brazil. This facility has an annual installed production capacity of 240,000 cubic meters and reached full production during the second half of 2001. The capacity utilization rate for these MDF production facilities was 102% in 2005, compared to 108% in 2004 and 101% in 2003. In the same complex, we finished construction in May 2001 of a melamine-laminating plant that is used for coating MDF and particle board. Total cost was approximately US$4.0 million. This laminating plant has an annual production capacity of approximately 110,000 cubic meters and when producing the 15 millimeters thickness board, this capacity is equivalent to seven million square meters. In September 2005, we started up our second laminating line with the same capacity. The Ponta Grossa OSB plant is the first of its type in Brazil. The plant has an annual installed production capacity of 300,000 cubic meters and became fully operational during the fourth quarter of 2002. The capacity utilization rate for Masisa Brazil OSB production facilities in Brazil was 87% in 2005 and 71% in 2004. The OSB plants production was adjusted to correspond to the demand generated by this product. 42 Table of Contents Rio Negrinho. We began operations at Masisa Madeiras Limitada (Masisa Madeiras, formerly known as Terranova Brasil) in 1997 with the acquisition of eliotti and taeda pine plantations. The saw logs harvested from Masisa Madeiras plantations are processed at its sawmill located in Rio Negrinho in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The 32,000 square meter industrial plant includes a sawmill and a finger-joint moulding processing plant. Masisa Madeiras was an important investment by our group for a number of reasons. Brazil offers a well-developed market for forest products and is ranked as the worlds eleventh largest economy with a population of approximately 177 million in 2003. Additionally, a favorable climate and year-round rainfall allow a comparatively greater rate of tree growth compared to other pine growing countries. In addition, the Rio Negrinho area provides an adequate pool of skilled labor that currently supports approximately 500 furniture factories of varying sizes. Our knowledge and experience gained in Chile enabled Masisa Madeiras to supply finger-joint mouldings, primarily to Masisa USA for sale in the United States. Masisa Madeiras currently has three principal product lines which are sold into the three following markets: finger-joint mouldings (United States); door parts (Chile); and sawn lumber for pallet manufacturers (Brazil). Masisa Madeiras mouldings plant is designed to produce mouldings which meet specifications for sale into the U.S. market. The plants principal products are raw and primed seven, fourteen and sixteen foot finger-joint mouldings and door frames. These products are then sold through Masisa USA to distributors and wholesalers. Currently, all door parts produced at the Rio Negrinho plant are sold to our plant in Chillán, Chile, where our solid wood doors are produced. We produce door parts in a variety of widths (e.g., 21/2, 5 and 51/2 inches), lengths (e.g., 24 ½ and 45 inches and 7 feet), and thicknesses (e.g., 3/4, 5/4 and 6/4 inches). The total volume of door parts produced by Masisa Madeiras depends on the quality of the logs and the drying process. Currently, the Rio Negrinho plant produces up to 1,200 cubic meters per month of door components. Wood processed and sold for use in pallet manufacturing is taken from the center of the log. Most of the wood processed by Masisa Madeiras for this purpose is sold in Brazil where it undergoes further processing or is sold directly to the end-user. The capacity utilization rate for our finger-joint moulding production facilities in Brazil was 131% in 2005, compared to 115% in 2004 and 126% in 2003. The capacity utilization rate for our sawmill production facilities in Brazil was 87% in 2005, compared to 88% in 2004 and 96% in 2003. Venezuela The following table shows for each of our Venezuelan production lines the product manufactured and the installed annual production capacity in cubic meters as of December 31, 2005. VENEZUELA WOOD PRODUCTS PRODUCTION LINES Annual installed Plant Line Product capacity(1) Andinos (Solid wood) Sawmill Various 150,000 Fibranova (Boards) Lines 1 & 2 Particle board 120,000 Line 1 MDF 250,000 Line 1 Melamine boards 60,000 Line 1 MDF mouldings 12,000 _______________________ (1) Units are in cubic meters. The annual installed capacity may vary slightly depending upon the thickness of the boards produced and other production factors. Actual production can exceed capacity because capacity is estimated assuming an average board thickness and actual board thickness may vary. Andinos CA. We completed construction of our Andinos sawmill in November of 2000. The sawmill is located in Puerto Ordaz in the Macapaima Industrial Complex, in the southern part of the state of Anzoátegui, Venezuela. The mills equipment and machinery are designed to process logs of varying diameters as required by 43 Table of Contents the market and custom orders, with the capacity of 150,000 cubic meters annually. The mill includes a treated log yard with a 20,000 square meter paved area and dryer kilns where we dry 100% of the production. The pine-sawn lumber produced by the Andinos sawmill is characterized by high density, small firm knots, and greater hardness. Our sawn lumber is used primarily in the manufacturing of pallets and packages. A smaller percentage is sold for use in ceiling and furniture construction. We plan to expand the capacity of this sawmill during 2006. Fibranova C.A. Our Fibranova plant processes intermediate wood products to produce MDF board and particle board. Its facilities are located also in Puerto Ordaz and include two processing lines for the production of particle board and MDF board, and a third line for the covering of melamine-laminated board. From January 2003 through the effective time of our merger with Masisa in 2005, this plant was administered and managed by our former subsidiary, Masisa, pursuant to a management contract. Since the merger, the contract has been assumed by us. The raw material used in the production process is supplied by the Caribbean pine plantations managed by Terranova Venezuela and from the chips and other by-products produced by the Andinos sawmill. Fibranovas installations have a current annual production capacity of 120,000 cubic meters of particle board, 250,000 cubic meters of MDF board, 60,000 cubic meters of melamine-laminated boards and 12,000 cubic meters of MDF mouldings. During the same time period we also formed a joint-venture with Establecimientos Industriales Oxiquim S.A., a Chilean resins manufacturer, to set up a joint venture in Venezuela to provide resin to Fibranova C.A.s production processes. The joint venture was called Oxinova C.A., a Venezuelan corporation, which began operations in July 2001 and currently produces and supplies resin to our board production plants in Venezuela. The capacity utilization rate for our particle board production facilities in Venezuela was 78% in 2005 and 2004 compared to 46% in 2003. The lower capacity utilization rate from 2003 resulted principally because we were in the initial phase of production during the second quarter of that year. The capacity utilization rate for our MDF production facilities in Venezuela was 88% in 2005, compared to 85% in 2004 and 57% in 2003. Our MDF mouldings production facilities in Venezuela suspended its operations due to strong local market demand for MDF boards, which is the principal raw material for this product. As a result, the capacity utilization rate for our MDF mouldings production facilities in Venezuela declined to 2% in 2005, compared to 31% in 2004 and 11% in 2003. The capacity utilization rate for our sawmill production facilities in Venezuela was 95% in 2005, compared to 86% in 2004 and 63% in 2003. In 2003, the nationwide 63 day strike in Venezuela affected our operations by causing us to temporarily halt production. As a result, production at our sawmill was reduced and the start-up of our board plant was affected. 44 Table of Contents Argentina The following table shows, for each of our Argentinean production lines, the products manufactured and the installed aggregate annual production capacity in cubic meters as of December 31, 2005.

The annual installed capacity may vary slightly depending upon the thickness of the boards produced and other production factors. Actual production can exceed capacity because capacity is estimated assuming an average board thickness and actual board thickness may vary. Masisa Argentinas production facilities are located in Concordia, an industrial town in the Province of Entre Rios on the Uruguay River, approximately 250 miles north of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The Concordia particle board production facility has the capacity to produce 185,000 cubic meters per year of raw particle board in two lines. The particle board line for thin particle board (under nine millimeters) has an annual production capacity of 25,000 cubic meters. The particle board line for greater board thickness has an annual production capacity of 160,000 cubic meters. The Concordia facility commenced operations in June 1994. The capacity utilization rate for Masisa Argentinas particle board production facilities was 85% in 2005 compared to 81% in 2004 and 77% in 2003. In September 1995, Masisa Argentina completed the installation of an MDF facility adjacent to its particle board facilities, in 1997, Masisa increased this MDF facilitys annual production capacity from 120,000 cubic meters to 138,000 cubic meters. In 1999, Masisa further increased its production capacity to 150,000 cubic meters. In October 2001, Masisa Argentina completed the construction of a thin-MDF plant at the Concordia Industrial Complex. The plant, which became fully operational by mid-2002, has an installed capacity of 120,000 cubic meters per year and represented an investment of approximately US$30.0 million, which was financed internally. The capacity utilization rate for Masisa Argentinas MDF production facilities was 88% in 2005 compared to 93% in 2004 and 85% in 2003. The Concordia plant also includes a melamine-laminating line with an installed capacity of 200,000 cubic meters per year, and a new foil lining process with an installed capacity of 48,000 cubic meters per year. In March 2002, Masisa Argentina began construction of its first line of pre-painted MDF mouldings in Argentina at the Concordia Complex. Production at the moulding plant is primarily directed to the United States. This line became fully operational during the second quarter of 2003. An additional 36,000 cubic meters of production capacity was added during 2004. The current capacity of 104,400 cubic meters was reached in February 2005 with the addition of a new production line. The capacity utilization rate for Masisa Argentinas MDF mouldings production facilities was 51% in 2004 compared to 91% in 2004 and 49% in 2003. The low utilization rate during 2003 and 2005 was due mainly to the addition of increased capacity during these periods. 45 Table of Contents Mexico The following table shows, for each of our Mexican production lines, the product manufactured and the installed annual production capacity in cubic meters as of December 31, 2005.

In December 2001, Masisa reached an agreement with Weyerhaeuser Company Limited to purchase from Weyerhaeusers subsidiary, MacMillan Guadiana, a particle board plant located in the city of Durango, Mexico. The plant has a total installed capacity of 120,000 cubic meters per year in two independent production lines, as indicated in the table above. The plant also includes a small melamine-laminating line, with a total installed capacity of 21,600 cubic meters per year. In June 2005 the former Mapals melamine-laminating line started operating in Mexico, extending the capacity up to 63,600 cubic meters per year. The capacity utilization rate for Masisa Mexicos particle board production facilities was 92% in 2005 compared to 91% in 2004. Most of the 2005 and 2004 production at this plant was directed toward the local market.

Masisa USA (formerly Terranova Forest Products) was established to market and distribute our products in the United States as part of our strategy of locating our commercial operations as close to our customers as economically feasible. Terranova Forest Products was organized in 1993 as a joint venture with Fiberform Wood Products, Inc. under the name Fiberform Andinos Corporation. In January 1996, we purchased Fiberforms interest in the joint venture and changed its name to Terranova Forest Products. In April 2005, Masisa USA, moved its headquarters and marketing operations to Atlanta, Georgia. Atlantas Hartsfield-Jackson serves as a major connecting hub serving destinations around the globe, providing easier access to our customers throughout the U.S. and to our world headquarters in Chile. Our MDF mouldings line has a total installed capacity of 36,000 cubic meters per year. The capacity utilization rate for our MDF mouldings line was 78% in 2005 compared to 90% in 2004 and 67% in 2003. 46 Table of Contents Forestry Operations Overview We and our forestry subsidiaries manage and operate the cultivation of our tree stock in our nurseries and the establishment and management of our plantations and forests, log manufacturing, log sales and marketing, log trading, transport and supply chain activities. The logs and other raw materials produced by us and our forestry subsidiaries and affiliates are sold primarily to our production and processing subsidiaries. Our sales to unaffiliated third parties representing 56.3% and 52.5% of our consolidated forest products sales for the years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our forestry operations add value by optimizing the harvest from our forests and complying with our principles of sustainable management. Land ownership and rights As of December 31, 2005, our groups forestry assets included an interest in approximately 367,318 hectares of land, of which 243,235 hectares are planted with renewable trees. Of our forestry assets, approximately 256,456 hectares (70%) are owned by our group, and the remaining 110,862 hectares (30%) are held under leases, forestry rights and forestry licenses, mainly in Venezuela. Our leases enable us to use the land for terms ranging from 16 to 34 years, depending on the location, which is generally the equivalent of one to two rotations. Forestry rights permit a person other than the owner to establish, manage and harvest, or simply manage and harvest, an estate of trees on the land. Distribution of forestry assets Our forests are located in Chile, Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. On a consolidated basis, Caribbean, radiata/oregon and eliotti/taeda pines are softwood pine species which constitute approximately 43.2%, 34.4%, and 11.2% of our plantations, respectively. In addition, our forests also include 27,362 hectares of eucalyptus trees, equal to approximately 11.2% of our total plantations. The following table sets out the number of hectares and types of uses of our land holdings and rights at December 31, 2005 for each of our forestry operations. Forestry Assets (in hectares) Chile Argentina Venezuela Brazil Consolidated Total forestry holdings 143,363 47,185 148,958 27,813 367,318 Owned 143,167 47,185 40,244 25,860 256,456 Rights/Leased 196  108,714 1,953 110,862 Total planted land 87,583 33,451 105,102 16,099 243,235 Plantations: Caribbean pine   105,080  105,080 Radiata/oregon pine 83,611  21  83,632 Taeda/elliotti pine  11,062  16,098 27,160 Eucalyptus 3,973 23,389  1 27,362 To be replanted 5,747 1,860 25,227 572 33,406 Protected lands 25,773 4,191 2,064 3,569 35,597 Native forests 18,306   1,794 20,100 Other (Araucariaconnifer) 1,142 6,684  5 7,831 Legal reserve    4,783 4,783 Roads, encampments and other uses 4,811  16,565 990 22,366 As part of our effort to match the size and location of our forestry assets with our supply needs and proximity to our production facilities, respectively, and in order to reduce financial debt we determined that we should dispose of certain land holdings in Chiles Region VII, near Talca. Accordingly, during the third and fourth quarters of 2004, we conducted a private auction for approximately 21,000 hectares of land, 12,000 of which were planted with radiata pine. On November 5, 2004, our board of directors accepted an irrevocable bid from Araucos 47 Table of Contents affiliate, Forestal Celco S.A., in the amount of US$73,558,000. On December 7, 2004, we signed a definitive agreement with Forestal Celco and completed the sale transaction for a final purchase price of US$73,284,636, or approximately US$6,100/ha. Certain of our forestry assets in Chile and all of our forestry assets in Argentina are held through Forestal Tornagaleones S.A. and Forestal Argentina S.A., respectively. On October 26, 2005, Masisa entered into an agreement with the holder of a significant minority interest in each of these companies to acquire that holder's 34.5% interest in the common equity securities of Forestal Tornagaleones S.A. for approximately US$29.9 million in cash and its 29.2% interest in the common equity securities of Forestal Argentina S.A. for approximately US$14.5 million in cash. Before the acquisition, Masisa owned 60.45% of the outstanding equity securities of Forestal Tornagaleones S.A., and Forestal Tornagaleones S.A. owned 50.1% of the outstanding equity securities of Forestal Argentina S.A. The closing of the purchase of the significant minority shareholder's interest in Forestal Tornagaleones S.A. for US$29.9 million occurred on November 15, 2005. Masisa also made an offer to the remaining minority shareholder in Forestal Tornagaleones S.A. to purchase its interests at the same price per share of common equity that was paid to the significant minority shareholder under the Forestal Tornagaleones S.A. purchase agreement. That offer expired without being accepted. Under the terms of the current shareholders' agreement of Forestal Argentina S.A. entered into by Masisa, the holder of the significant minority interest and the remaining minority shareholders, the minority shareholders have (i) a right of first refusal to purchase the interest of the significant minority shareholder and (ii) a tag along right to sell their interests together with the significant minority shareholder. Pursuant to such shareholders' agreement, the significant minority shareholder has delivered to the remaining minority shareholders of Forestal Argentina S.A. a notice informing them of the purchase agreement entered into with Masisa and requesting such minority shareholders to give notice of their intent to exercise or not their right of first refusal or tag along right. During the first quarter of 2006, ten of the eleven remaining minority shareholders of Forestal Argentina S.A. exercised their tag along right. The total purchase price paid by Masisas subsidiary, Forestal Tornagaleones, including for shares purchased from the significant minority shareholder, was approximately $24.3 million. On December 20, 2005, the Comisión de Defensa de la Libre Competencia of Argentina declined to review the purchase of the significant minority interest, satisfying a condition to the closing of that transaction. As a result of the purchase of the minority interests, Forestal Tornagaleones now controls 98.68% of the share capital of Forestal Argentina S.A. Forest management Our forestry subsidiaries cultivate, administer and manage our forestry assets in Chile, Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil. We manage our forestry assets to maximize the value of the wood. We seek to achieve this through the use of planting, soil and site preparation, maintenance of optimum soil quality through monitoring and fertilization, underbrush control, and management of tree density through thinning and pruning. This management system in Chile, Argentina and Brazil increases our forests production of larger diameter trees with fewer knots and other defects and, as a result, can produce a higher overall yield of clear wood. Clear wood, whether sold to third parties as lumber or used by our production facilities to produce our processed wood products, generally commands a higher price than knotted wood. A significant variable affecting the profitability of our forestry operations is the age at which a tree is harvested, or the rotation length. The rotation length has a direct impact on timber quality, unit volume and economic return obtained from the investment. We currently consider our forestry management objectives, described above, to be achievable on an average rotation length of approximately 23, 24, 26 and 22 years for radiata, Caribbean, eliotti and taeda pine, respectively, and 12 years for eucalyptus. The optimal rotation length can vary depending on past management practices, the cost of capital and prevailing market conditions. 48 Table of Contents The following tables set forth the age profile by hectares of our forests at December 31, 2005 on a consolidated basis and for each of our forestry operations.

Sustainable development and forestry management systems We adhere to ISO management systems and certification under the Forestry Stewardship Council (FSC). FSC is an international organization funded to support environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial and economically viable management of the worlds forests. The FSC certification standard is recognized by The Home Depot, one of the key end-users to which our products are marketed through Masonite in the United States. Certification of our forest products and management systems has enabled us to access international markets such as the United States, where chain of custody certification of products is frequently preferred by customers. It has also given our products greater environmental credibility in the international marketplace by allowing our customers to readily and reliably determine that the product they are purchasing comes from a forest managed according to internationally agreed social and environmental principles and criteria. Forest protection Our forestry assets are exposed to risk of loss due to fire, wind, pests and disease. Accordingly, our forestry subsidiaries have established programs for the prevention and control of each of these risk factors. Our forestry operations prevention efforts include, among others, identifying risks neighboring our forests, public education of communities located near our forests and maintenance of firebreaks. We also cooperate with other forestry companies when possible to undertake joint prevention measures with respect to pest and disease control. 49 Table of Contents Insurance We insure our assets and operations against a variety of risks associated with our business activities. The types and amounts of coverage we maintain depend on the kind of facility or asset being insured as well as its location. These plans include insurance policies against fire damage, loss attributed to natural disasters, risks related to the construction of projects, losses resulting from delays in commencing such projects and business interruption. In Chile, we maintain coverage of our fixed assets in an aggregate amount of US$650.9 million. This amount includes US$315.6 million for losses on our plantations and US$335.3 million for losses due to interruptions in the operations of our plants and broken equipment. In Brazil, we maintain coverage of our fixed assets in an aggregate amount of US$323.1 million. This amount includes US$71.2 million for losses on our plantations and US$251.9 million for losses due to interruptions in the operations of our plants and broken equipment. In Venezuela, we maintain coverage of US$259.4 million for losses due to interruptions in the operations of our plants and broken equipment. Our plantations in Venezuela are not insured because Venezuelas insurance market did not offer insurance coverage for these types of risks. In Argentina, we maintain coverage of our fixed assets in an aggregate amount of US$249.5 million. This amount includes US$40.1 million for losses on our plantations and US$209.5 million for losses due to interruptions in the operations of our plants and broken equipment. In Mexico, we maintain coverage of US$51.7 million for losses due to interruptions in the operations of our plants and broken equipment. In United States, we maintain coverage of US$24.9 million for losses due to interruptions in the operations of our plants and broken equipment. We maintain coverage of US$10.0 million for liabilities arising out of civil corporate responsibility claims. As of December 31, 2005, a high number of our personnel have travel and life insurance. Raw Materials and Suppliers Solid wood & forestry business The most significant direct costs associated with our solid wood products and forestry operations are adhesives, fertilizers, wood fungicides, lumber, water-based paint, plants, chemicals, logs, labor and energy. In general, the prices of raw materials we use in our forestry operations are relatively stable. The prices of raw materials we use in our wood products operations depend on factors such as wood, pulp and oil prices and tend to fluctuate according to economic cycles and world supply. For example, wood prices in Chile increased by approximately 15% during 2004 and 7% during 2005. The increase in 2005 is primarily due to increased demand for wood based products and higher transportation costs due to higher energy costs. Our principal suppliers in each country in which we have industrial facilities and the products or raw materials they supply to us in connection with our solid wood and forestry business are listed in the following table: 50 Table of Contents PRINCIPAL SUPPLIERS OF RAW MATERIALS FOR SOLID WOODS & FORESTRY BUSINESSES CHILE PRODUCT BRAZIL PRODUCT Arauco Distribución S.A.

The services contracted by our forestry operations range from logistical support (meals, transport, cleaning and maintenance, security, reception and dispatch of products, among others) to production activities (harvest, transport, planting, thinning, pruning, road construction, and others). In the industrial sector, our subsidiaries and affiliates subcontract with third-party providers for a variety of services at our sawmills and manufacturing facilities. These services include, among others, packaging, separating sticks, movement of logs and lumber, and industrial cleaning. Specific contracts are established for each of these services outlining technical, economic and administrative specifications. Boards business The most significant direct costs associated with the production of particle board, MDF and OSB in connection with our board operations are chemicals, wood, labor and energy. In 2005, chemical adhesives used in the production of particle board and MDF in Chile and Argentina were manufactured by the chemical plants of Georgia Pacific Resinas Ltda. (formerly GPM) and Resinas Concordia S.A., respectively. These two plants also manufactured most of the chemical catalysts used by the Company in those countries. Until early 2001, Masisa had a 50% interest in both companies under a joint venture with Georgia-Pacific. In January 2001, Masisa sold its participation in those companies to Georgia-Pacific. However, before this transaction, Masisa Chile and Masisa Argentina reached long-term resin supply contracts with GPM and Resinas Concordia S.A. to ensure the normal supply of resins for existing and future operations, including calculations for future growth of the Company in Chile and Argentina. In Brazil, the principal chemical adhesives used in the production of MDF and OSB were supplied by Borden Químicos Indústria e Com. Ltd. and Synteko Produtos Químicos S.A. In Mexico, the principal chemical adhesives used in the production of the particle boards were supplied by Dynea Mexico S.A. de C.V. In Venezuela, we have a partnership relationship as well as a long-term resin supply contract with Oxinova, which supplies 100% of our resin needs. Oxinova was formed as a partnership by Terranova and Oxiquim, and it is managed by Oxiquim. We have a long-term resin supply contract with Georgia Pacific Resins Ltd. in Chile to ensure the normal supply of resins for existing and future operations, taking into account the future growth of the Company. Payments made under the contract in 2005 totaled US$38.8 million. The contract is not a financial obligation since it does not oblige us to purchase a minimum amount from Georgia Pacific Resins Ltd. In Argentina, Resina Concordia, an affiliate of Georgia-Pacific Resins Ltd., supplies Masisa with resin. We believe that the market for the chemicals our board operations need is sufficiently competitive and accessible such that we could satisfy our chemical requirements through other suppliers on terms similar to those obtained from our current suppliers. There is more than one producer of chemical raw materials in each country in which we have industrial facilities, granting us flexibility as to our suppliers. We also have a number of suppliers for the raw materials used in its production processes. We believe that the loss of any one of these suppliers, individually, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company. Raw materials are also available from countries in the region as well as more distant ones, such as the United States and Japan. Fluctuations in resin prices affect our production costs because adhesives, a combination of resin and chemical additives, represent approximately 35% of our board production costs. Urea and Methanol, components of 52 Table of Contents resin, are derived from natural gas. The increased price of natural gas during 2005 therefore led to increased resin prices. Historically, Forestal Tornagaleones provided Masisas Chilean plants with small supplies of wood. Masisa, however, has not purchased a material amount of wood from Forestal Tornagaleones since 2000. In Argentina, approximately 92% of the wood consumed by Masisa Argentina in 2003 was purchased from several unrelated saw mills and forest growers and the other 8% of the wood was purchased from Forestal Argentina. The wood consumed by Masisa for the production of MDF in Brazil was purchased either from owned forests or several unrelated saw mills and forest growers. With respect to the particle board plant in Mexico, Masisa obtains wood from suppliers that serviced the plant under its previous ownership. We believe that adequate supplies of wood are available. We do not use material amounts of native wood for our production processes. With respect to wood supply, we have several alternatives in forestry companies, including our subsidiaries Forestal Tornagaleones and Forestal Argentina. We may also obtain supplies from the forest plantations that we own in Brazil. The steam we use in our manufacturing operations is largely generated by burning our own scrap wood and defective wood products. Other energy requirements, such as electricity, are obtained from commercial suppliers. In general, the prices of raw materials we use in our forestry operations are relatively stable. The prices of raw materials we use in our wood products operations depend on factors such as wood, pulp and oil prices and tend to fluctuate according to economic cycles and world supply. In 2005, high and steadily rising oil prices increased our energy costs as well as the cost for the adhesives we use to manufacture board products. 53 Table of Contents Masisas principal suppliers in Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico and the products or raw materials they supply to us in connection with our board businesses, are listed in the following table: PRINCIPAL SUPPLIERS OF RAW MATERIALS FOR BOARDS BUSINESSES CHILE PRODUCT ARGENTINA PRODUCT Aserraderos Arauco S.A.

Our business philosophy is based on sustainable development principles, and our policy is to maintain high standards of environmental performance and to make all efforts to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. During 2003, 2004 and 2005, we spent on a consolidated basis US$5.7 million, US$3.2 million and US$ 3.6 million, respectively, on environmental projects related to complying with environmental regulation. We expect to continue to make the necessary expenditures to comply with such environmental requirements. Certifications: The ISO 14,001 certification is a voluntary procedure in which an operations environmental practices are evaluated against a specified set of criteria. Our forestry and production operations have obtained the International Organization for Standardization (the ISO) 14,001 compliance certifications. Our solid wood 54 Table of Contents operations in Chile and plants in Brazil will recertify under a unified management system in September 2006, including OHSAS 18001. Additionally, all of our forestry and production operations, except our forestry operations in Argentina and our solid wood and board production facilities in Venezuela, have obtained the Occupational Health and Safety Management System (the OHSAS) 18,001 compliance certifications. We are in process of achieving OHSAS 18,001 compliance certifications for all our production operations by the end of 2006. Our forestry operations also obtained Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) compliance certifications regarding sustainable management of forestry assets, except in Argentina where we expect to achieve FSC certification during 2006. Our solid wood and particle board production operations in Venezuela will obtain the Chain of Custody FSC certification that allows identifying the products with the FSC seal. This certification was already obtained for our MDF production in Venezuela and solid wood production in Chile and Brazil. In addition, in 2003 our MDF production plants in Chile, Brazil, and Argentina obtained the Certificate for Recycled Content granted by the Scientific Certification System (SCS). This certificate confirms that the raw material used in production comes from material recycled from other forestry processes. This practice helps reduce the demand for forestry resources, recycle materials considered waste in other lines of business and reduce manufacturing costs. We are subject to extensive and frequently changing environmental regulation in the countries in which we operate. Such regulations cover, among other things, the discharge of water and discharges into the water and air. A discussion of some of the key environmental regulations for each country in which our most significant operations are located is set forth below. Chile: Chilean companies, including Masisa, are subject to several national and local environmental laws, regulations, decrees and municipal ordinances concerning, among other things, discharges into air and water, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and health. Chilean environmental regulations have become increasingly stringent in recent years, particularly for the approval of new projects, and this trend is likely to continue. We have made and will continue to make substantial expenditures to comply with such environmental laws, regulations, decrees and ordinances. We have further developed our environmental activities and compliance in Chile by subscribing, along with 13 other companies, to the Acuerdo de Producción Limpia, an environmental cooperation agreement between environmental authorities and industry for managing our solid wood operations in Chile. We are currently discussing a similar Agreement for the production of boards. Chilean legislation to which we are subject includes the Chilean Environmental Basic Law (Law 19,300 of 1994), based upon article 19 No. 8 of the National Constitution, which establishes the general structure of the Chilean environmental law. Law 19,300 defines the Government agencies responsible, among other things, for assessing environmental impact studies, overseeing the implementation of projects in accordance with their environmental impact statements and coordinating environmental regulations.These agencies are Comisión Nacional del Medio Ambiente (National Environmental Commission or CONAMA) and Comisiones Regionales del Medio Ambiente (Regional Environmental Commissions or COREMA). We are subject to other regulations, such as: DS 146 (Ministry of Health) on environmental noise, DS 609 (Public Works Ministry) on potable water and DFL 725 (Ministry of Health) on human health. DS 594 (Ministry of Health), and DS 298 (Transportation Ministry) on handling and transportation of waste and hazardous waste, and DFL 1 (Ministry of Health), DFL 725 (Ministry of Health) and DS 594 (Ministry of Health) on health issues in the work place. Regulation DS 95 (Ministry of the Presidency) requires us and all companies in Chile to conduct environmental impact studies of any future projects or activities that may effect the environment. 55 Table of Contents During 2005 our plant in Valdivia was fined by the Superintendencia de Servicios Sanitarios, the effluents control agency, because of a delay in the submission of discharge information. The sanction was applied by the authority at its minimum level (approximately US$3,500). We immediately paid the fine and submitted all the information requested. New norms to be applied in 2006 include DS 46 (Ministry of the Presidency) on discharges of industrial effluents to underground water bodies, DS 90 (Ministry of the Presidency) on discharges of industrial effluents to surface water bodies, DS 148 (Ministry of the Health) regarding management of hazard industrial waste. Masisa believes it has made the necessary investments in order to fully comply with these new norms. In 2006, we expect new legislation with a three year compliance period with respect to air emissions. Affected persons, including private citizens, public agencies and local governmental authorities, can sue under the Chilean Environmental Basic Law to enforce environmental compliance. Enforcement remedies can include temporary or permanent closure of facilities and fines. Private citizens are also allowed to object to the plans or environmental impact studies submitted by project owners. While we seek to implement our business strategy by complying with environmental legislation and by being proactive with environmental and community matters, the application of environmental laws may have an adverse affect on our operations. Brazil: We are subject to Brazilian environmental legislation, including regulation by municipal, provincial and federal governmental authorities. We believe that our operations are currently in material compliance with applicable local and national environmental regulations. In addition, because our production processes are based on wood from planted trees and because all of our forestry operations involve planted trees, we do not believe that there are material environmental concerns applicable to us that result from the use of natural forest resources. Laws 6938/81, 9605/98, and 4771/65 give the general framework for environmental legislation in Brazil. Other norms applicable to Masisa in Brazil include Resolution 237/97 on environmental licenses, SEMA 41/02, which defines norms for air emissions, Law 9433/97 and Resolution 357/05 which regulate effluents, Law 12493/99 that regulates management of waste and dangerous waste and Resolution 01/90 on noise. Regional norms applicable to our plant in Ponta Grossa include Law Paraná 13.448/02 on environmental audits, and Law Paraná 13.806/02  Resolution SEMA 41/02 on air emissions. We expect such requirements on air emissions to be extended to our plant in Rio Negrinho by 2007. Our plants in Brazil possess the necessary environmental permits and licenses issued by FATMA (Foundation for the Environment) and lAP (Environmental Institute of Paraná), SUDERHSA (Superintendência de Recursos Hídricos do Paraná), and IBAMA (Instituto Brasileiro de Meio Ambiente). All of Masisas operations in Brazil have obtained ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certifications. Our forestry plantations and Chain of Custody are certified under FSC, and our Ponta Grossa plant has been audited to obtain FSC certification this year. As a result of the merger between Masisa and Terranova, we have to update certifications for both plants and will obtain a new integrated system certification in 2006. Venezuela: Our Venezuelan operations are subject to Venezuelan environmental legislation, including regulation by municipal, provincial and national governmental authorities. Masisa Venezuela already complies with the new Organic Law for Prevention, Conditions and Work Environment, published in 2005, and expects some minor regulatory changes because of decrees enforcing this law in 2006. Decree 638 regulates air emissions, and norm COVENIN 2253:2001 regulates emissions in the work place. Management of waste and hazardous waste is regulated by Decree 1257, Decree 2635 and Decree 2216. Transportation and management of chemical products is regulated by Decree 1847 and by norms COVENIN 2268:96 and 2817:91. Effluents to water are regulated by Decree 883, and Decree 2217 regulates environmental noise. Safety at the workplace is regulated by the Organic Law of Prevention, Conditions, and Workplace Environment. In 2006 Masisa Venezuela will apply for the FSC Chain of Custody certification for solid wood and particle boards, and will obtain OHSAS 18001 certification together with its recertification of ISO 14001. Mexico: Our plant in Durango possesses an Environmental License (Licencia Ambiental Única) from the State of Durango, and we believe that we are in material compliance with all environmental laws and regulations affecting our facilities and products in Mexico. Our operations in Mexico are subject to the National Environmental 56 Table of Contents Law2001 (Ley General de Equilibrio Ecológico y la Protección al Medio Ambiente, 1998), and to the local Environmental Law issued by the State of Durango (Ley Estatal del Equilibrio Ecológico y Protección al Ambiente, 2001, enforced by the Secretaría de Recursos Naturales y Medio Ambiente, Durango. Air emissions are covered by NOM-043-SEMARNAT-1993, enforced by the State of Durango, Secretaría de Recursos Naturales y Medio Ambiente, and by the national norm, "Reglamento de la Ley General del Equilibrio Ecológico y la Protección al Ambiente en materia de Registro de Emisiones y Transferencia de contaminantes", 2004. Federal Laws 052 and 054 and the General Law for Prevention and Management of Waste, 2003, enforced by local authorities, regulate management of dangerous waste. We believe national waste norms will probably be modified in the near future, but we expect those changes will not require significant investment by Masisa Mexico. Water management is regulated by the National Water Law of 2003 and 2004, the Federal Rule on Wastewater Control of 2003 (Reglamento del Gobierno del Estado sobre Control de Aguas Residuales), and by local norm NOM-002-ECOL-1996. Masisa Mexico obtained ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certifications in 2004. Argentina: In Argentina we have made new investments in management of waste water to allow its complete re-utilization. Industrial facilities have ventilation systems, including the moulding plant, where systems were installed in 2005. We possess Sanitary Authorization from the Department of Development, Ecology and Environmental Control from the Province of Entre Ríos. All companies in Argentina, including Masisa, are subject to several national and local environmental laws, regulations, decrees and municipal ordinances concerning, among other things, discharges into air and water, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and health. Provincial Law No. 6260 Contamination Prevention by the Industries with its Reglamentary Decree No. 5837 regulates the wastewater discharges and air quality, solid waste handling, noises and vibrations. National Law No. 24051 Hazardous Wastesgeneration, handling, transport and treatment and its Reglamentary Decree No. 831 regulate the management of hazardous wastes and air emissions. Our Integrated Management System is externally verified and ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certified. The next audit to maintain our external certifications is scheduled for October 2006. We also have the SCS certification (Scientific Certification Systems), which certifies that our boards have 100% recycled and reclaimed fiber content. United States: our production facility operates under several environmental permits and regulations. The Conditional Major Air Quality Permit is issued under the provisions of the Pollution Control Act, Sections 48-1-50(5) and 48-1-110(a), and the 1976 Code of Laws of South Carolina, Regulation 61-62. The permit allows an emission rate of 100 TPY of VOCs and PM emissions, and we have successfully maintained levels of less than 1.3 TPY VOCs and less than 30 TPY PM Emissions. The facility operates a closed loop waste water recycling system that is permitted under the Clean Water Act, CERCLA 40 CFR 302 and the NPDES General Permit No. SCR000000. The production facility does not generate any hazardous wastes and maintains an extensive recycling program for waste disposal under South Carolina US Code Title 44. As a result of the recycling efforts the company has recycled 94.7%, 92.3% and 73.2% of all waste products, by volume, in 2004, 2005 and thus far in 2006 respectively. The Masisa USA operation does not foresee issues with environmental legislation in the USA, but continues to monitor trends and to seek out opportunities to further reduce its environmental impact. Masisa USA was certified ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 in December of 2003 and has successfully maintained these certifications with no major non conformities. Our operating philosophy is to minimize all environmental impacts through sound engineering and operational practices and continuous improvement. As part of the GrupoNueva group, we are committed to transparency in our environmental and social performance, and publish sustainability reports every two years. 57 Table of Contents Item 4A. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects Introduction Operating and Financial Review and Prospects begins with a brief Overview of our business and products, the most important events affecting our financial performance for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 and other issues which are material to a readers understanding of the information presented in this section. The Overview concludes with our business outlook for 2006 and an overview of significant factors affecting the comparability of our historical results of operations and financial condition for each of the periods compared in our Results of Operations discussion. This is followed by a discussion of our Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 and for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in 2003. The next section provides an analysis of our Liquidity and Capital Resources, including changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and discusses our financial commitments. The last two sections discuss the impact of currency devaluation on our results and our critical accounting policies. The following discussion is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the Notes thereto, included elsewhere in this document. This section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the Business outlook section. These uncertainties and risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Overview Business and products  Our primary source of revenue is the sale of MDF, particle board, mouldings, sawn lumber, OSB and solid wood doors. Our business strategy is to be an integrated Latin American forestry and wood products company with plantations in rapid growth regions, a competitive industrial capacity, a strong distribution channel in Latin America and an important presence in the United States. We have production facilities in six principal markets Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, Mexico and the United States  with access to environmentally-friendly, long-term, low-cost supplies of wood, principally in Chile, Argentina and Brazil. Although we also export to other Latin American and world-wide markets, our performance in our principal markets is, and will continue to be, fundamental to our strategy and results of operations. In an effort to diversify, we have recently expanded our distribution channels to non-principal markets, such as Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, by opening new commercial offices and increasing the number of Placacentro stores throughout Latin America. We are also actively seeking to incorporate into our product mix higher margin products such as melamine-laminated wood paneling and expand into new products that have significant synergies with our core boards business. For example, we are studying the possibility of producing and selling plywood.  Demand for our products is principally driven by the construction and furniture industries. Demand for our products is significantly influenced by growth in the construction and furniture industries, which are highly correlated with regional economic conditions. Our most important market currently, and in our strategy for the future, is the United States. Additionally, the strength of the U.S. economy helps stimulate the Mexican economy, leading to increased levels of housing starts and increased demand for our sawn lumber and board products in that market. Latin America, our primary market for boards, has recently shown strong economic growth resulting in increased market demand and pricing for our board products. 58 Table of Contents  Most of our products are commodity products which are currently benefiting from a global high cycle for commodities Most of our productshave experienced increased demand as a result of the global increase in demand for commodity products. Although this trend may prompt our competitors to add new capacity in the regions where we produce and sell our products, we do not expect such additional capacity to exceed the increased demand. For OSB, the increase in demand is being accompanied by new capacity added, particularly in the United States. As a result, the growth of our OSB sales depends significantly on the Brazilian market. Because our products are commodity products, prices are subject to certain volatility, and we have limited control over the degree and timing of price fluctuations of our products.  Our strategy is to balance our sales in a number of markets representing a portfolio of currencies. The majority of our sales and transactions are indexed to U.S. dollars in the medium-term. This means that in the short-term, a Latin American currency appreciation can significantly increase our sales when translated into U.S. dollars. In contrast, a devaluation in Latin American currencies decreases our local performance, but can significantly increase our competitiveness and ability to export to the US and other export markets. Impact of general economic conditions As explained above, regional economic conditions have a significant impact on our results of operations. The table below presents the GDP growth rates for each of our most important markets in addition to forecasts by the International Monetary Fund for growth in 2006. Year ended December 31, Forecast 2003 2004 2005 2006 United States 3.0% 4.4% 3.5% 3.4% Chile 3.3% 6.0% 6.3% 5.5% Argentina 8.8% 9.0% 9.2% 7.3% Venezuela (7.7)% 17.3% 9.3% 6.0% Brazil 0.5% 5.2% 2.3% 3.5% Mexico 1.6% 4.4% 3.0% 3.5% Source: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook, Globalization and Inflation, April 2006 Business outlook We do not expect significant changes in market conditions during 2006. In addition, we expect continued economic stability in Latin America due to the strong cycle for commodities. This should positively affect the demand for our board products in these markets. Even with weakening housing prospects in the United States, we expect increased demand for our mouldings there due to lower inventory levels in the distribution channels and reduced supplies caused by mill closings in Brazil However, several factors could negatively impact our performance during 2006. Prices for our products periodically fluctuate in price cycles, which are highly unpredictable. A decline in the housing market could affect demand for our products and reduce prices. Higher oil prices could result in further increases in the cost of resin, an important raw material for boards production which could negatively affect our costs. Additionally, increased oil prices affect energy prices which could further increase our costs. The appreciation of local currencies where we operate, particularly the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, against the U.S. dollar could negatively affect our export business. Significant factors affecting the comparability of our historical results of operations and financial condition The following is a summary of the most significant factors that affected our results for each of the periods compared in our Results of Operations discussion, which follows this Overview. Although these are not the only factors 59 Table of Contents which affected our results, we believe these factors are key to understanding our financial performance for the periods specified. Year ended December 31, 2005: High and steadily rising oil prices during 2005, leading to further price increases for the adhesives we use to manufacture board products. Currency appreciation, particularly in Chile and Brazil, increasing labor and other local raw material costs. Higher administrative and sales expenses, mainly due to the merger between Masisa and Terranova during 2005. Continued market strength in all our board markets. Oversupplied conditions in the U.S. finger-joint market, leading to lower prices but partially recovering by the end of the year. Year ended December 31, 2004: Higher OSB prices cycles in the United States during the first quarter of 2004, declining moderately in the second and third quarter and increasing again in the fourth quarter. Strong demand and high prices for MDF mouldings in the United States, particularly during the second and third quarters of 2004. Economic recovery in Argentina, strong growth in Brazils economy, and significant growth in each of Mexico and Chile, thereby improving demand for our products. High and steadily rising oil prices during 2004, leading to price increases for the adhesives we use to manufacture board products. High freight costs resulting from high oil prices and scarcity of container and shipping availability. Year ended December 31, 2003: Pricing pressure in particle board and MDF during the first half of the year. Significant price pressure on finger-joint mouldings and solid wood products in general in the United States. Economic recovery in Argentina and stabilization of regional currencies, leading to greater demand and higher prices for our products and decreased low cost imports of particle board from Argentina into Chile. Higher OSB prices in the United States in the second half of 2003. Results of Operations Consolidated The discussion below analyzes and compares on a consolidated level the period-on-period comparisons of our results of operation for the year ended December 31, 2005 to 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2004 to 60 Table of Contents 2003. A more detailed understanding of our business segments and product performance can be obtained by reading the geographic segments and product sections that follow. The following table summarizes our consolidated financial results for the periods indicated. Under Chilean GAAP, the merger between Masisa S.A. and Terranova S.A. has been accounted for as a merger of commonly controlled companies on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2005. As such, the historical financial statements for the periods prior to the merger are not restated under Chilean GAAP. Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$, except where noted) 2003 2004 2005 Net sales $ 480.1 $ 651.0 $ 744.0 Gross margin 105.9 189.2 192.1 Operating income 21.6 95.1 79.5 Non-operating results (47.5) (11.2) (47.6) Net income(1) (20.0) 56.8 24.4 Depreciation, amortization and depletion(2) 63.5 70.6 75.0 Physical volume sales (thousands of cubic meters)(4) 3,040.3 3,788.4 3,696.4 Average price per cubic meter (US$)(3) 152 166 196 Net sales growth % 62.8% 35.6% 14.3% Gross margin %* 22.1% 29.1% 25.8% Operating income margin %* 4.5% 14.6% 10.7% Net income margin %* (4.2%) 8.7% 3.3% * Amounts are expressed as percentages of net sales. (1) Due to the incorporation of Masisa into and with the Company and the acquisition of part of the minority interest in Forestal Tornagaleones, and its effect on minority interest, net income for 2004 and 2005 are not comparable. Please see the discussion on Minority Interest below for further information. (2) Depletion, which is included in costs of sales, are costs attributed to timber harvested and are determined by each identifiable farm block that is in the harvesting stage based on the relationship of unamortized timber costs to the estimated volume of recoverable timber multiplied by the amount of timber cut. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Includes MDF, particle board, finger-joint mouldings, OSB, sawn lumber, solid wood doors, MDF mouldings and saw and pulp logs. Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004 Net sales increased 14.3% to US$744.0 million in 2005 compared to US$651.0 million in 2004. The increase was due mainly to strong or moderate growth in net sales across all our geographic segments and for most of our products, with the exception of solid wood doors. The average price of our principal wood products per cubic meter in 2005 was US$196 compared to US$166 per cubic meter in 2004. Consolidated sales of our principal wood products by physical volume decreased by 2.4% to 3,696.4 thousand cubic meters in 2005, compared to 3,788.4 thousand cubic meters in 2004. Gross margin increased from US$189.2 million in 2004 to US$192.1 million in 2005, but decreased as a percentage of net sales from 29.1% of net sales, in 2004, to 25.8%, in 2005 due to higher raw material and energy costs leading to higher average costs of sales. Selling and administrative expenses totaled US$112.6 million, or 15.1% of net sales, in 2005, representing a 19.6% increase from US$94.1 million, or 14.5% of net sales, in 2004. This increase was due primarily to increased sales, local currency appreciation and merger related expenses. Operating income decreased by 16.4% to US$79.5 million, or 10.7% of net sales, in 2005 compared to US$95.1 million, or 14.6% of net sales, in 2004. The decrease in operating income is attributable mainly to higher selling and administrative expenses and higher costs of sales, offset partially by higher sales. 61 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$) 2004 2005 NON-OPERATING RESULTS Financial income $ 1.9 $ 3.9 Share of income from unconsolidated affiliates 1.3 0.7 Other non-operating income 47.3 2.8 Amortization of goodwill (0.8) (0.8) Amortization of negative goodwill 3.3 3.4 Financial expenses (39.3) (38.8) Other non-operating expenses (21.8) (8.4) Price-level restatements 0.5 0 Foreign exchange (losses) gains (3.7) (10.4) Non-operating results $ (11.2) $ (47.6) Non-operating results worsened from a loss of US$11.2 million in 2004 to a loss of US$47.6 million in 2005. Foreign exchange losses were US$10.4 million in 2005 compared to a foreign exchange loss of US$3.7 million in 2004. The foreign exchange loss in 2005 was due principally to the effect of the appreciation of the Chilean peso on our debt denominated in UF. We use derivative instruments, such as swaps or cross currency contracts, which are based directly or indirectly upon interest rates and currencies, to manage and reduce the risk inherent in currency and interest rate fluctuations. Financial income increased 105.3% from US$1.9 million in 2004 to US$3.9 million in 2005 due to higher interest earning cash balances. Share of income from unconsolidated affiliates decreased 46.2% from US$1.3 million in 2004 to US$0.7 million in 2005. Other non-operating income decreased 94.1% from US$47.3 million in 2004 to US$2.8 million in 2005 due to a non-recurring gain on the sale of mainly forestry assets for approximately US$44.3 million in 2004. Amortization of goodwill was flat in 2005, compared to the same period in 2004. Amortization of negative goodwill increased 3.0% from US$3.3 million in 2004 to US$3.4 million in 2005. Financial expense decreased 1.3% from US$39.3 million in 2004 to US$38.8 million in 2005 mainly due to reduced levels of debt. Other non-operating expenses decreased 61.5% from US$21.8 million in 2004 to US$8.4 million in 2005 due to (i) a provision for idle assets recognized by the company during the fourth quarter of 2004; and (ii) a provision for a non-operational doubtful account in 2004; partially offset by the expenses incurred, as well as depreciation and amortization generated by the temporary shutdown of Masisas industrial plants during 2005. Minority interest benefit was US$5.7 million in 2005 compared to an expense of US$15.4 million in the year 2004. This reflects primarily losses at our Venezuelan subsidiaries and the incorporation of the former Masisa into and with the Company during 2005, as well as the purchase of a significant part of the minority interest in Forestal Tornagaleones S.A., and the resulting elimination of the associated minority interest expense. Income tax expense increased 16.1% to US$13.6 million in 2005, compared to US$11.7 million in the year 2004. We reported net income of US$24.4 million, or 3.3% of net sales, in 2005 compared to net income of US$56.8 million, or 8.7% of net sales, in 2004. However, these results are not comparable due to the incorporation of the former Masisa into and with the Company and the resulting elimination of the associated minority interest expense. 62 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003 Net sales increased 35.6% to US$651.0 million in 2004 compared to US$480.1 million in 2003. The increase was due mainly to higher average prices and significantly higher physical volume sales across a majority of our product and geographic segments. The average price of our principal wood products per cubic meter in 2004 was US$166 compared to US$152 per cubic meter in 2003. Consolidated sales of our principal wood products by physical volume increased 24.6% to 3,786.6 thousand cubic meters in 2004, compared to 3,040.3 thousand cubic meters in 2003. Gross margin increased from US$105.9 million, or 22.1% of net sales, in 2003 to US$189.2 million, or 29.1% of net sales, in 2004. This was mainly due to higher sales and increased gross margin as a percentage of sales due to higher average prices while average costs of sales decreased slightly. Selling and administrative expenses totaled US$94.1 million, or 14.5% of net sales, in 2004, representing an 11.6% increase from US$84.3 million, or 17.6% of net sales, in 2003. This increase was due primarily to higher selling expenses associated with significantly increased sales and merger related expenses. Operating income increased by 340.4% to US$95.1 million, or 14.6% of net sales, in 2004 compared to US$21.6 million, or 4.5% of net sales, in 2003. The increase in operating income is attributable mainly to significantly higher sales and gross margin. Non-operating results improved from a loss of US$47.5 million in 2003 to a loss of US$11.2 million in 2004 principally due to a significant one-time gain on the sale of forests, and a decrease in foreign exchange losses and despite a significant increase in other non-operating expenses. The table below summarizes the principle components of our non-operating results. 63 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$) 2003 2004 NON-OPERATING RESULTS Financial income $ 3.9 $ 1.9 Share of income from unconsolidated affiliates 0.8 1.3 Other non-operating income 5.9 47.3 Amortization of goodwill (0.9) (0.8) Amortization of negative goodwill 3.0 3.3 Financial expenses (40.0) (39.3) Other non-operating expenses (7.3) (21.8) Price-level restatements (0.2) 0.5 Foreign exchange (losses) gains (12.5) (3.7) Non-operating results $ (47.5) $ (11.2) Financial income declined 50.3% to US$1.9 million in 2004 from US$3.9 million in 2003 due to lower interest earning average cash balances. Share of income from unconsolidated affiliates increased 76.6% to US$1.3 million in 2004 from US$0.8 million in 2003 principally due to higher income from our investment in Oxinova. Other non-operating income increased to US$47.3 million in 2004 from US$5.9 million in 2003 mainly due to a gain of $42.0 million on the sale of approximately 21,000 hectares of our Chilean forests to an affiliate of Arauco. Additionally, we recognized a gain on the sale of goods and services and compensation from insurance due to damages to our plant in Venezuela. Amortization of goodwill declined 16.5% to US$0.8 million in 2004 from US$0.9 million in 2003 mainly due to the conclusion of the amortization period in 2003 of our investment in Maderas y Paneles S.A. Amortization of negative goodwill increased 11.2% to US$3.3 million in 2004 from US$3.0 million in 2003 mainly due to the acquisition of Terranova International in October 2003. Financial expense decreased slightly to US$39.3 million in 2004 from US$40.0 million in 2003. Other non-operating expenses increased 197.6% to US$21.8 million in 2004 from US$7.3 million in 2003 due mainly to the following: US$9.2 million provision for idle assets. During the fourth quarter of 2004 we recognized a US$4.9 million provision for wood scanners in Chile and Brazil that after a testing period and negotiations with the supplier were determined to be unusable for their intended purpose. The provision was for the total cost of the equipment. Additionally, we recognized a provision for US$1.0 million during 2004 as a result of obsolete particle board line equipment in Masisa Mexico. The equipment was partially used to recondition a different particle board line and the remaining balance was completely written off since the expected recoverable value is negligible. We recognized a provision for US$0.6 million during 2004 for equipment on Masisa Argentinas impregnation line considered obsolete. The provision was for the entire book value of the equipment. The remaining provisions were for various obsolete plant and equipment in Terranova Chile and Venezuela and were for the entire book value of such equipment since the expected recoverable value is negligible. US$2.8 million write off for doubtful non-operational accounts. We recognized a write off for a doubtful loan to our unconsolidated affiliate. US$2.1 million in severance indemnities. During the fourth quarter of 2004, several executives either left the company or transferred to affiliates of the company which triggered contractual severance payments. Price-level restatements were US$0.5 million in 2004 compared to US$0.2 million in 2003 but did not materially affect our results of operations. Foreign exchange losses were US$3.7 million in 2004 compared to a foreign exchange loss of US$12.5 million in 2003 due mainly to the impact of the appreciation of the Chilean peso on our debt issued in UF. Minority interest expense was US$15.4 million in 2004 compared to a benefit of US$5.2 million in 2003. Income tax expense was US$11.7 million in 2004 compared to a benefit of US$0.6 million in 2003 due to significant increase in income before minority interest and income taxes. Income tax expense increased despite the 64 Table of Contents recognition of a tax loss from a previous period of approximately US$10.3 million which reduced our tax expense in 2004. We reported net income of US$56.8 million, or 8.7% of net sales, in 2004 compared to net loss of US$20.0 million, or 4.2% of net sales, in 2003. The increase in net income in 2004 compared to 2003 reflects significantly improved sales, operating income and non-operating results offset by higher income tax expense. Geographic segments The following discusses our results of operations by geographic segments based on the location in which the sale is originated, as reported in Note 23(2)(e) of the Consolidated Financial Statements. You should also note that since the merger of our former subsidiary Masisa into and with us, we have been in the process of implementing, but have not yet completed, a reorganization of our businesses into three divisions: the Boards Division, the Solid Wood Division and the Forestry Division. For certain corporate level management purposes, as of the date of this document we group our geographic segments by country of origin only. However, our historical financial segment presentation for 2003, and for 2004 when compared to 2003, remain grouped by the former Terranova and Masisa businesses that existed prior to our merger on May 31, 2005 and represent the way management viewed our business. Accordingly, our period-on-period comparisons for our geographic segments for such annual periods are grouped and discussed by the former Terranova and Masisa business divisions. You should also note that some of our geographic segments include significant inter-company sales, especially in Chile, Brazil and Venezuela. To better understand our business and results of operations we have included inter-company sales separately in the tables below. Years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 compared by geographic segment United States Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$, except percentages) 2004 2005 Net Sales to Third Parties $ 139.6 $ 191.5 Inter-company Sales   Net Sales 139.6 191.5 Gross Margin 15.6 15.0 Selling and Administrative Expenses (8.9) (13.0) Operating Income 6.7 2.0 Depreciation, amortization and depletion(1) $ 0.7 $ 0.7 Net Sales Growth %  37.2% Gross Margin % * 11.2% 7.8% Operating Income Margin % * 4.8% 1.0% * Amounts are expressed as percentages of net sales.

See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. In the United States, net sales increased 37.2% to $191.5 million in 2005 compared to US$139.6 million in 2004. The sales increase was due mainly to the strong growth in physical volume sales of MDF mouldings and the introduction of OSB as part of Masisa USAs product mix. Gross margin declined 4.0% despite the increased volume as market prices for all product lines fell throughout 2005. Gross margin as a percent of sales declined due to the introduction of lower priced OSB and MDF moulding through Masisa USAs commercial network. Despite an increase in physical volume sales, operating income decreased to US$2.0 million, or 1.0% of net sales, in 2005. The decrease in operating income is attributable to a reduction in gross margin as a consequence of increased outbound freight expenses resulting from higher overall volumes, 65 Table of Contents increased fuel prices and increased payroll expenses for the larger sales force and logistical team required to handle the increased unit volume.

See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. In Chile, net sales increased 3.1% to US$245.6 million in 2005 compared to US$238.3 million in 2004. This was mainly due to higher physical volume sales and prices of particle board in the local market and higher physical volume export sales of MDF moulding to the United States, partially offset by lower physical volume sales of finger-joint mouldings. Gross margin decreased to US$53.8 million, or 22.8% of net sales in 2005 compared to US$57.0 million or 23.9% of net sales in 2004. The decrease in gross margin is due primarily to increase costs due to higher prices of wood, resin and energy, and the appreciation of the Chilean peso. Operating income decreased slightly to US$18.2 million or 8.3% of net sales compared to US$20.8 million or 7.4% of net sales. This decrease is due mainly to lower gross margin partially offset by lower selling and administrative expenses. 66 Table of Contents Brazil Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$, except percentages) 2004 2005 Net Sales to Third Parties $ 117.9 $ 102.5 Inter-company Sales 36.5 54.0 Net Sales 154.4 156.4 Gross Margin 53.9 35.6 Selling and Administrative Expenses (11.8) (14.5) Operating Income 42.1 21.1 Depreciation, amortization and depletion(1) $ 16.1 $ 19.5 Net Sales Growth %  1.3% Gross Margin % * 34.9% 22.7% Operating Income Margin % * 27.3% 13.5% * Amounts are expressed as percentages of net sales.

See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. In Brazil, net sales increased 1.3% to US$156.4 million in 2005 compared to US$154.4 million in 2004. The increase was mainly due to higher prices in the local boards market and a shift in our MDF product mix to higher priced laminated MDF, which was partially offset by lower price of OSB and finger-joint mouldings in the United States export market. The increase in sales was also due to the appreciation of the Brazilian real. Gross margin decreased to US$35.6 million, or 22.7% of net sales, during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to US$53.9 million, or 34.9% of net sales, for the same period in 2004. Despite an increase in net sales, gross margin declined due to lower OSB and finger-joint mouldings prices, combined with higher wood and resin costs and the appreciation of the Brazilian real. Operating income decreased to US$21.1 million, or 13.5% of net sales, in 2005 compared to US$42.1 million, or 27.3% of net sales, in 2004. The decrease in operating income is attributable to lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expenses due to the strengthening of the Brazilian real. 67 Table of Contents Venezuela Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$, except percentages) 2004 2005 Net Sales to Third Parties $ 45.0 $ 70.7 Inter-company Sales 36.9 28.8 Net Sales 82.0 99.5 Gross Margin 17.8 18.6 Selling and Administrative Expenses (13.5) (15.1) Operating Income 4.4 3.5 Depreciation, amortization and depletion(1) $ 15.2 $ 16.6 Net Sales Growth %  21.5% Gross Margin % * 21.7% 18.7% Operating Income Margin % * 5.3% 3.5% * Amounts are expressed as percentages of net sales.

See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. In Venezuela, net sales increased 21.5% to US$99.5 million in 2005 compared to US$82.0 million in 2004. The increase was mainly due to higher physical volume sales in the local board market, which resulted in higher average prices compared to our export prices, and, to a lesser extent, increased physical volume sales of sawn lumber. Gross margin increased 4.5% in 2005 to US$18.6 million, or 18.7% of net sales, compared to US$17.8 million, or 21.7% of net sales, in 2004. This increase was mainly due higher net sales partially offset by increased production costs due to higher resin prices. Operating income decreased to US$3.5 million, or 3.5% of net sales, in 2005 compared to US$4.4 million, or 5.3% of net sales, in 2004. The decrease in operating income is attributable to higher selling and administrative expenses as a result of a new collective labor agreement and higher inland freight costs, partially offset by a higher gross margin. 68 Table of Contents Mexico Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$, except percentages) 2004 2005 Net Sales to Third Parties $ 103.5 $ 113.3 Inter-company Sales 0.2 0.2 Net Sales 103.7 113.5 Gross Margin 18.0 17.8 Selling and Administrative Expenses (10.8) (17.1) Operating Income 7.3 0.7 Depreciation, amortization and depletion(1) $ 1.5 $ 1.8 Net Sales Growth %  9.5% Gross Margin % * 17.4% 15.7% Operating Income Margin % * 7.0% 0.6% * Amounts are expressed as percentages of net sales.

See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. In Mexico net sales increased 9.5 % to US$113.5 million in 2005 compared to US$103.7 million in 2004. The increase was mainly due to a higher prices and physical volume sales of MDF and particle board offset by lower physical volume sales in sawn lumber. Gross margin increased to US$17.8 million, or 15.7% of net sales, in 2005 compared to US$18.0 million, or 17.4% of net sales, in 2004. This increase was mainly due to higher net sales partially offset by higher raw material costs and provisions for deficit in inventories. Operating income decreased to US$0.7 million, or 0.6% of net sales, in 2005 compared to US$7.3 million, or 7.0% of net sales, in 2004. This decrease in operating income was due to higher selling and administrative expenses as a result of higher sales commissions, provisions for employees benefits (profit sharing), and provisions for a doubtful receivables account. 69 Table of Contents Argentina Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$, except percentages) 2004 2005 Net Sales to Third Parties $ 77.7 $ 81.5 Inter-company Sales 12.2 23.4 Net Sales 90.0 104.9 Gross Margin 23.2 29.0 Selling and Administrative Expenses (8.6) (9.5) Operating Income 14.6 19.5 Depreciation, amortization and depletion(1) $ 11.0 $ 10.0 Net Sales Growth %  16.6% Gross Margin % * 25.8% 27.7% Operating Income Margin % * 16.3% 18.6% * Amounts are expressed as percentages of net sales.

See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. In Argentina, net sales increased 16.6% to US$104.9 million in 2005 compared to US$90.0 million in 2004. The increase was mainly due to continued improvement in the Argentinean local market as a result of the economic recovery and higher prices and export sales in regional markets which were partially offset by weaker export sales of MDF mouldings to the United States. The improved local market for boards has allowed us to reduce our lower margin export sales, leading to improved board pricing. Gross margin increased to US$29 million, or 27.7% of net sales, in 2005 compared to US$23.2 million, or 25.8% of net sales, in 2004. This increase was mainly due to higher net sales, as discussed above, which were partially offset by increased cost of sales due to higher resin, wood and energy prices. Operating income increased to US$19.5 million, or 18.6% of net sales, in 2005 compared to US$14.6 million, or 16.3% of net sales, in 2004. The increase in operating income was attributable to higher sales and gross margin partially offset by a moderate increase in selling and administrative expenses due to, among other things, higher export expenses. 70 Table of Contents Years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 compared by geographic segment Our historical financial segment presentation for 2003, and for 2004 when compared to 2003, remain grouped by the former Terranova and Masisa businesses that existed prior to our merger on May 31, 2005 and represent the way management viewed our business. Accordingly, our period-on-period comparisons for our geographic segments for such annual periods are grouped and discussed by the former Terranova and Masisa business divisions. Terranova USA Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$, except percentages) 2003 2004 Net Sales to Third Parties $ 118.0 $ 139.6 Inter-company Sales   Total Net Sales 118.0 139.6 Gross Margin 9.9 15.6 Selling and Administrative Expenses (8.2) (8.9) Operating Income 1.7 6.7 Depreciation $ 0.7 $ 0.7 Net Sales Growth % (1.2)% 18.2% Gross Margin % * 8.4% 11.2% Operating Income Margin % * 1.5% 4.8% * Amounts are expressed as percentages of net sales. Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In the United States, net sales increased 18.2% to US$139.6 million in 2004 compared to US$118.0 million in 2003. The increase was due mainly to a moderate increase in the price of finger-joint mouldings and higher physical volume sales of our solid wood doors. While average prices of our solid wood door sales decreased slightly during the period, they began to recover beginning in the second quarter of 2004. Gross margin increased from US$9.9 million, or 8.4% of net sales, in 2003 to US$15.6 million, or 11.2% of net sales, in 2004. This increase is due mainly to increased sales as described above and higher sales of MDF moulding that we produce in our U.S. plant, which contributes to a higher gross margin as a percentage of sales. Operating income increased to US$6.7 million, or 4.8% of net sales, in 2004 compared to US$1.7 million, or 1.5% of net sales, in 2003. The increase in operating income is attributable to higher sales and gross margin partially offset by a moderate increase in selling and administrative expenses. 71 Table of Contents Terranova Chile Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$, except percentages) 2003 2004 Net Sales to Third Parties $ 10.7 $ 13.6 Inter-company Sales 66.8 82.0 Total Net Sales 77.5 95.6 Gross Margin 19.3 20.9 Selling and Administrative Expenses (15.9) (15.1) Operating Income 3.4 5.8 Depreciation $ 6.1 $ 5.4 Net Sales Growth % (23.6)% 23.4% Gross Margin % * 24.8% 21.8% Operating Income Margin % * 4.3% 6.1% * Amounts are expressed as percentages of net sales. Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In Chile, net sales increased 23.4% to US$95.6 million in 2004 compared to US$77.5 million in 2003. This was due mainly to higher sales to Masisa USA and an increase in sales of saw and pulp logs that resulted from selling damaged trees knocked down during a severe wind storm. Gross margin was US$19.3 million, or 24.8% of net sales, in 2003 compared to US$20.9 million, or 21.8% of net sales, in 2004. Despite higher finger-joint moulding prices in the U.S. market, our gross margin as a percentage of sales declined due to a US$4.1 million write-off of certain timber stands whose actual cost was greater than the estimated real harvest value, and selling lower margin damaged saw and pulp logs. Operating income increased to US$5.8 million, or 6.1% of net sales, in 2004 compared to US$3.4 million, or 4.3% of net sales, in 2003. This was mainly due to lower selling and administrative expenses that resulted from cost savings from a reduction in our workforce which we carried out as part of the reorganization of our business units in 2003, which were offset by merger related expenses in the fourth quarter of 2004. Terranova Brazil Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$, except percentages) 2003 2004 Net Sales to Third Parties $ 1.2 $ 3.9 Inter-company Sales 28.9 33.0 Total Net Sales 30.1 36.9 Gross Margin 4.0 10.1 Selling and Administrative Expenses (3.2) (2.7) Operating Income 0.8 7.4 Depreciation $ 3.3 $ 3.4 Net Sales Growth % (10.0)% 22.8% Gross Margin % * 13.2% 27.3% Operating Income Margin % * 2.5% 20.1% * Amounts are expressed as percentages of net sales. Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In Brazil, net sales increased 22.8% to US$36.9 million in 2004 compared to US$30.1 million in 2003. This was due mainly to higher finger-joint moulding sales to Masisa USA as a result of higher finger-joint moulding prices in the U.S. market. Gross margin increased from US$4.0 million, or 13.2% of net sales, in 2003 to US$10.1 million, or 27.3% of net sales, in 2004. This increase is due mainly to higher net sales as discussed above while average costs were flat and physical 72 Table of Contents volume sales of finger-joint mouldings declined. Operating income increased to US$7.4 million, or 20.1% of net sales, in 2004 compared to US$0.8 million, or 2.5% of net sales, in 2003. The increase in operating income is attributable to higher gross margin.

Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In Venezuela, net sales increased 64.6% to US$94.3 million in 2004 compared to US$57.3 million in 2003. The increase is due mainly to the incorporation of twelve months of board sales in 2004 versus only nine months during 2003 when our board plant was in a start-up phase from January to March. Additionally, net sales of sawn lumber to Terranova Mexico increased due to significantly higher physical volume sales that were partially offset by lower prices. Gross margin increased from a loss of US$0.4 million, or 0.6% of net sales, in 2003 to US$17.8 million, or 18.9% of net sales, in 2004. This increase is due mainly to higher net sales and the incorporation of full period results for our board sales. Also, high average production costs and low prices for our board products during 2003 were reversed during 2004 as our board business moved towards profitability. However, the increase in our gross margin was partially offset by a shift from shaved sawn lumber to lower margin rough sawn lumber. Operating income increased from a loss of US$11.5 million, or 20% of net sales, in 2003 to US$4.4 million, or 4.6% of net sales, in 2004. The increase in operating income is attributable to higher sales and gross margins. However, selling and administrative expense increased as a result of fully incorporating our board operations administrative expenses and higher selling expenses due to increased physical volume sales. 73 Table of Contents Terranova Mexico Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$, except percentages) 2003 2004 Net Sales to Third Parties $ 36.3 $ 48.1 Inter-company Sales 1.4 9.4 Total Net Sales 37.6 57.5 Gross Margin 2.2 5.8 Selling and Administrative Expenses (3.2) (3.7) Operating Income (1.1) 2.1 Depreciation $ 0.3 $ 0.2 Net Sales Growth % 30.9% 52.9% Gross Margin % * 5.7% 10.2% Operating Income Margin % * (2.9)% 3.7% * Amounts are expressed as percentages of net sales. Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In Mexico, net sales increased 52.9% to US$57.5 million in 2004 compared to US$37.6 million in 2003. The increase is due mainly to higher physical volume sales and prices of sawn lumber, some of which is imported from Terranova Venezuela. Gross margin increased from US$2.2 million, or 5.7% of net sales, in 2003 to US $5.8 million, or 10.2% of net sales, in 2004. This increase is due mainly to higher sales which were partially offset by increased overseas shipping costs. Operating income increased from a loss of US$1.1 million, or 2.9% of net sales, in 2003 to US$2.1 million, or 3.7% of net sales, in the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in operating income is attributable to higher gross margin which was partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses due to higher volume sales.

Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In Chile, net sales increased 23.2% to US$144.7 million in 2004 compared to US$117.5 million in 2003. This was due mainly to higher physical volume sales and average prices in both particle board and MDF in the local market. We have benefited from strong economic growth in Chile leading to a surge in the construction sector. In addition, Argentinas strong economic recovery has reduced import price pressure. Gross margin increased from US$27.9 million, or 23.8% of net sales, in 2003 to US$36.1 million, or 24.9% of net sales, in 2004. This was due mainly to increased sales offset by average costs increases as a result of higher raw material costs such as resin and wood. Operating income increased to US$15.0 million, or 10.4% of net sales, in 2004 compared to US$10.0 million, or 8.5% of net sales, in 2003. 74 Table of Contents This was mainly due to higher gross margin partially offset by higher selling expenses due to increased sales, merger related expenses and a moderate appreciation of the Chilean peso relative to the U.S. dollar.

Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In Argentina, net sales increased 31.9% to US$90.8 million in 2004 compared to US$68.9 million in 2003. The increase was due mainly to the continued economic recovery in Argentina leading to higher physical volume sales and prices in the local market for both particle board and MDF. Local particle board prices increased by more than 18% and local MDF prices rose more than 7% in 2004. Additionally, Masisa Argentina began selling significant quantities of our new MDF mouldings to the U.S. market towards the end of 2003 and which continued to increase steadily throughout 2004. Gross margin increased from US$12.0 million, or 17.4% of net sales, in 2003 to US$23.2 million, or 25.6% of net sales, in 2004. This increase is due mainly to increased sales and higher margins resulting from strong recovery in prices in particle board and MDF and an increase in sales of higher margin MDF mouldings. Operating income increased to US$14.6 million, or 16.1% of net sales, in 2004 compared to US$4.4 million, or 6.5% of net sales, in 2003. The increase in operating income is attributable to higher gross margin partially offset by higher selling expenses due to increased sales.

Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In Brazil, net sales increased 61% to US$118.7 million in 2004 compared to US$73.8 million in 2003. The increase is due mainly to strong demand and pricing for OSB 75 Table of Contents exports to the United States and significantly higher physical volume sales of MDF in the local market. OSB prices in the United States increased by approximately 65%. Gross margin increased from US$19.3 million, or 26.2% of net sales, in 2003 to US$43.8 million, or 36.9% of net sales, in 2004. This increase is due mainly to higher sales and an expansion of the gross margin as a percentage of sales due to higher OSB prices in the United States. Operating income increased to US$34.7 million, or 29.2% of net sales, in 2004 compared to US$12.9 million, or 17.4% of net sales, in 2003. The increase in operating income is attributable to the substantially higher gross margin that was only partially offset by increased selling expenses and a moderate appreciation of the Brazilian real relative the U.S. dollar. Masisa Mexico Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$, except percentages) 2003 2004 Net Sales to Third Parties $ 34.8 $ 55.4 Inter-company Sales 0.1 0.2 Total Net Sales 34.9 55.6 Gross Margin 5.0 12.2 Selling and Administrative Expenses (6.8) (7.0) Operating Income (1.8) 5.2 Depreciation $ 0.9 $ 1.0 Net Sales Growth % 223.1% 59.4% Gross Margin % * 14.4% 21.9% Operating Income Margin % * (5.2)% 9.3% * Amounts are expressed as percentages of net sales. Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In Mexico, net sales increased 59.4% to US$55.6 million in 2004 compared to US$34.9 million in 2003. The increase is due mainly to significantly higher physical volume sales and moderately higher prices for particle board and MDF. In addition to producing and selling particle board, Masisa Mexico also distributes and sells MDF and OSB imported from Masisas other subsidiaries. Gross margin increased from US$5.0 million, or 14.4% of net sales, in 2003 to US$12.2 million, or 21.9% of net sales, in 2004. This increase is due mainly to higher sales and higher particle board prices which increased gross margins as perrcentage of sales. Operating income increased from a loss of US$1.8 million, or 5.2% of net sales, in 2003 to US$5.2 million, or 9.3% of net sales, in 2004. The increase in operating income is attributable to higher gross margin and that was only partially offset by a small increase in selling and administrative expenses. 76 Table of Contents Product sections MDF Year ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 Net sales (millions of US$) $ 154.6 $ 215.9 $ 250.2 Physical volume sales (thousands of cubic meters) 783.5 931.6 880.9 Average price per cubic meter (US$) 197 232 284 % of consolidated net sales 32.2% 33.2% 33.6% Net sales growth %  39.6% 15.9% Volume growth %  18.9% (5.4)% Price change %  17.4% 22.6% Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. MDF sales generated US$250.2 million, or 33.6% of our total net sales, in 2005 compared to US$215.9 million, or 33.2% of net sales, in 2004. MDF physical volume sales decreased by 5.4% from 931.6 thousand cubic meters in 2004 to 880.9 thousand cubic meters in 2005. This decrease is mainly attributable to greater use of raw MDF for MDF mouldings and lower physical volume sales in the Brazilian market partially offset by higher physical volume sales in the Venezuelan market. Average prices in U.S. dollars for consolidated MDF sales increased 22.6% to US$284 per cubic meter in 2005, compared to US$232 in 2004. The increase in MDF prices is mainly due to an increase in market prices for MDF in all of our principal markets. Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. MDF sales generated US$215.9 million, or 33.2% of our total net sales, in 2004 compared to US$154.6 million, or 32.2% of net sales, in 2003. MDF physical volume sales increased by 18.9% from 783.5 thousand cubic meters in 2003 to 931.6 thousand cubic meters in 2004. This increase in physical volume sales is mainly attributable to strong demand in all our principal markets, especially in Argentina as result of its continued economic recovery and in Brazil as a result of an increase in the overall market for MDF. Average prices in U.S. dollars for consolidated MDF sales increased 17.4% to US$232 per cubic meter in 2004, compared to US$197 in 2003. The increase in MDF prices is mainly due to strong demand in all our principal markets offsetting, in the case of Brazil, an increase in competition. Particle board Year ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 Net sales (millions of US$) $ 100.6 $ 125.9 $ 154.0 Physical volume sales (thousands of cubic meters) 608.2 649.7 700.1 Average price per cubic meter (US$) 165 194 220 % of consolidated net sales 20.9% 19.3% 20.7% Net sales growth %  25.2% 22.4% Volume growth %  6.8% 7.8% Price change %  17.2% 13.6% Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Particle board sales generated US$154.0 million, or 20.7% of our total net sales, in 2005 compared to US$125.9 million, or 19.3% of net sales, in 2004. Particle board physical volume sales increased by 7.8% from 649.7 thousand cubic meters in 2004 to 700.1 thousand cubic meters in 2005. The small increase in physical volume sales is mainly attributable to improved overall market conditions in our local markets, except for a small decrease in Brazils physical volume sales. Average prices in U.S. dollars for consolidated particle board sales increased 13.6% to US$220 per cubic meter in 2005, compared to US$194 in 2004. The increase in particle board prices is mainly due to improved local market conditions in Brazil and Chile that allowed us to reduce lower margin export sales. 77 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Particle board sales generated US$125.9 million, or 19.3% of our total net sales, in 2004 compared to US$100.6 million, or 20.9% of net sales, in 2003. Particle board physical volume sales increased by 6.8% from 608.2 thousand cubic meters in 2003 to 649.7 thousand cubic meters in 2004. This increase in physical volume sales is mainly attributable to strong demand in all our principal markets, especially Argentina as a result of its continued economic recovery. Average prices in U.S. dollars for consolidated particle board sales increased 17.2% to US$194 per cubic meter in 2004, compared to US$165 in 2003. The increase in particle board prices is mainly due to strong demand in all our principal markets. Finger-joint mouldings Year ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 Net sales (millions of US$) $ 75.6 $ 81.4 $ 83.1 Physical volume sales (thousands of cubic meters) 193.7 171.6 180.0 Average price per cubic meter (US$) 390 474 462 % of consolidated net sales 15.8% 12.5% 11.2% Net sales growth %  7.6% 2.0% Volume growth %  (11.4)% 4.8% Price change %  21.5% (2.7)% Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Finger-joint moulding sales generated US$83.1 million, or 11.2% of our total nets sales, in 2005 compared to US$81.4 million, or 12.5% of net sales, in 2004. Finger-joint moulding physical volume sales increased by 4.8% from 171.6 thousand cubic meters in 2004 to 180.0 thousand cubic meters in 2005. The increase in physical volume is mainly attributable to increased sales focus and new customers. Average prices in U.S. dollars for consolidated finger-joint moulding sales declined 2.7% to $462 per cubic meter in 2005, compared to US$474 in 2004. The decline in finger-joint prices is mainly due to increased industry capacity and our distributors high inventory levels. The majority of finger-joint moulding production sold by Masisa USA is produced by Masisa. Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Finger-joint moulding sales generated US$81.4 million, or 12.5% of our total net sales, in 2004 compared to US$75.6 million, or 15.8% of net sales, in 2003. Finger-joint moulding physical volume sales decreased by 11.4% from 193.7 thousand cubic meters in 2003 to 171.6 thousand cubic meters in 2004. This decrease in physical volume sales is mainly attributable to a shift in Chilean production to solid wood doors. Average prices in U.S. dollars for consolidated finger-joint moulding sales increased 21.5% to US$474 per cubic meter in 2004, compared to US$390 in 2003. The increase in finger-joint moulding prices is mainly due to strong demand in the U.S. construction sector and the resulting recovery from depressed prices during 2002 and 2003. All of our finger-joint moulding production and sales are from Terranova. OSB Year ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 Net sales (millions of US$) $ 27.7 $ 53.4 $ 59.7 Physical volume sales (thousands of cubic meters) 178.1 241.6 261.1 Average price per cubic meter (US$) 155 221 229 % of consolidated net sales 5.8% 8.2% 8.0% Net sales growth %  93.3% 11.8% Volume growth %  35.7% 8.1% Price change %  42.5% 3.4% Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. OSB sales generated US$59.7 million, or 8.0% of our total net sales, in 2005 compared to US$53.4 million, or 8.2% of net sales, in 2004. OSB physical volume sales increased by 78 Table of Contents 8.1% from 241.6 thousand cubic meters in 2004 to 261.1 thousand cubic meters in 2005, mainly due to increased physical volume sales in the United States. This year was the first year that Masisa USA marketed OSB with the initial sales completed in February. Average prices in U.S. dollars for consolidated OSB sales increased 3.4% to US$229 per cubic meter in 2005, compared to US$221 in 2004. The increase in OSB prices is mainly due to an increase in the Brazilian market price, offset by a lower price cycle in the U.S. Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. OSB sales generated US$53.4 million, or 8.2% of our total net sales, in 2004 compared to US$27.7 million, or 5.8% of net sales, in 2003. OSB physical volume sales increased by 35.7% from 178.1 thousand cubic meters in 2003 to 241.6 thousand cubic meters in 2004. This increase in physical volume is mainly attributable to strong demand for OSB in the United States for construction. Average prices in U.S. dollars for consolidated OSB sales increased 42.5% to US$221 per cubic meter in 2004, compared to US$155 in 2003. The increase in OSB prices is mainly due to strong demand in the United States in the housing construction sector. All of our OSB sales and production are from our Masisa Brazil segment. Sawn lumber Year ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 Net sales (millions of US$) $ 37.2 $ 56.0 $ 66.6 Physical volume sales (thousands of cubic meters) 240.7 299.7 327.8 Average price per cubic meter (US$) 155 187 203 % of consolidated net sales 7.7% 8.6% 9.0% Net sales growth % 50.5% 19.0% Volume growth % 24.5% 9.4% Price change % 20.9% 8.8% Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Sawn lumber sales generated US$66.6 million, or 9.0% of our total net sales, in 2005 compared to US$56.0 million, or 8.6% of net sales, in 2004. Average prices in U.S. dollars for consolidated sawn lumber sales increased 8.8% to US$203 per cubic meter in 2005, compared to US$187 in 2004. This price increase mainly reflects the scarcity of wood and higher raw material costs. Sawn lumber physical volume sales increased by 9.4% from 299.7 thousand cubic meters in 2004 to 327.8 thousand cubic meters in 2005. This increase in physical volume sales is mainly attributable to increased trading activities. Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Sawn lumber sales generated US$56.0 million, or 8.6% of our total net sales, in 2004 compared to US$37.2 million, or 7.7% of net sales, in 2003. Sawn lumber physical volume sales increased by 24.5% from 240.7 thousand cubic meters in 2003 to 299.7 thousand cubic meters in 2004. This increase in physical volume sales is mainly attributable to higher sawn lumber sales to Mexico from Venezuela as well as from our Forestal Argentina subsidiary. Average prices in U.S. dollars for consolidated sawn lumber sales increased 20.9% to US$187 per cubic meter in 2004, compared to US$155 in 2003. The increase in sawn lumber prices is mainly due to a general recovery in the wood market. 79 Table of Contents Solid wood doors Year ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 Net sales (millions of US$) $ 32.8 $ 37.9 $ 32.8 Physical volume sales (thousands of cubic meters) 36.1 42.6 35.7 Average price per cubic meter (US$) 909 889 920 % of consolidated net sales 6.8% 5.8% 4.4% Net sales growth %  15.3% (13.4)% Volume growth %  17.8% (16.4)% Price change %  (2.2)% 3.5% Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Solid wood door sales generated US$32.8 million, or 4.4% of our total net sales, in 2005 compared to US$37.9 million, or 5.8% of net sales, in 2004. Solid wood door physical volume sales decreased by 16.4% from 42.6 thousand cubic meters in 2004 to 35.7 thousand cubic meters in 2005. This decrease in physical volume was due to both lower production levels in Chile and reduced inventory purchasing during the second half of 2005 by Masisas largest US door customer. Our production volume decreased primarily because we shifted some of our resources to the production of doors that require less wood. Our largest US door customer reduced its inventory purchasing for operational reasons. Average sales prices in U.S. dollars for consolidated solid wood door sales increased by 3.5% to US$920 per cubic meter in 2005 compared to US$889 in 2004. Solid wood door prices increased mainly due to new pricing agreed with our main customer. All solid wood door sold in the United States, are produced by Masisa in Chile. Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Solid wood door sales generated US$37.9 million, or 5.8% of our total net sales, in 2004 compared to US$32.8 million, or 6.8% of net sales, in 2003. Solid wood door physical volume sales increased by 17.8% from 36.1 thousand cubic meters in 2003 to 42.6 thousand cubic meters in 2004. This increase in physical volume sales is mainly attributable to a recovery in demand for premium door products in the United States. Average prices in U.S. dollars for consolidated solid wood door sales decreased 2.2% to US$889 per cubic meter in 2004, compared to US$909 in 2003. The decrease in solid wood door prices is mainly due to continued competitive pressure from premium door producers in Brazil and South Africa. All of our solid wood door production and sales are from Terranova. MDF mouldings Year ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 Net sales (millions of US$) $ 16.6 $ 32.8 $ 47.3 Physical volume sales (thousands of cubic meters) 48.1 90.3 113.7 Average price per cubic meter (US$) 345 363 416 % of consolidated net sales 3.5% 5.0% 6.4% Net sales growth %  97.9% 44.3% Volume growth %  87.8% 25.9% Price change %  5.4% 14.6% Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. MDF moulding sales generated $47.3 million, or 6.4% of total net sales, in 2005 compared to US$32.8 million, or 5.0% of net sales, in 2004. MDF moulding physical volume sales increased by 25.9% from 90.3 thousand cubic meters in 2004 to 113.7 thousand cubic meters in 2005. The increase in physical volume sales is mainly attributable to additional production capacity in Chile, increased capacity in Argentina and growing acceptance of MDF mouldings by customers in the United States. Average prices in U.S. dollars for consolidated MDF moulding sales increased 14.6% to US$416 per cubic meter in 2005, compared to US$363 in 2004. Beginning in 2005, Masisa began marketing most of its MDF mouldings sales in the United States through Masisa USA leading to increased sales in that market 80 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. MDF moulding sales generated US$32.8 million, or 5.0% of our total net sales, in 2004 compared to US$16.6 million, or 3.5% of net sales, in 2003. MDF moulding physical volume sales increased by 87.8% from 48.1 thousand cubic meters in 2003 to 90.3 thousand cubic meters in 2004. This increase in physical volume sales is mainly attributable to the additional sales of MDF mouldings from Argentina whose production did not reach full capacity until the end of 2003. Average prices in U.S. dollars for consolidated MDF moulding sales increased 5.4% to US$363 per cubic meter in 2004, compared to US$345 in 2003. The increase in MDF mouldings prices was primarily due to strong construction demand for mouldings and constrained supply as a result of limited shipping availability into the United States from moulding producing countries. Saw and pulp logs Year ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 Net sales (millions of US$) $ 18.2 $ 27.1 $ 30.1 Physical volume sales (thousands of cubic meters) 951.9 1361.4 1,197.0 Average price per cubic meter (US$) 19 20 25 % of consolidated net sales 3.8% 4.2% 4.0% Net sales growth %  49.3% 11.1% Volume growth %  43.0% (12.1)% Price change %  4.4% 26.3% Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Saw and pulp log sales generated US$30.1 million, or 4.0% of our total net sales, in 2005 compared to US$27.1 million, or 4.0% of net sales, in 2004. Saw and pulp log physical volume sales decreased by 12.1% from 1,361.4 thousand cubic meters in 2004 to 1,197.0 thousand cubic meters in 2005. This increase in sales is mainly driven by higher prices in our principal markets, partially offset by lower physical volume sales. Higher prices are mainly attributable to the scarcity of logs in Brazil, Argentina and Chile. The decrease in physical volume sales is mainly attributable to a decreased supply of trees due to a severe wind storm that knocked down trees in Chile, as well as an increase in intercompany log sales for our production and processing subsidiaries, especially in Brazil and Argentina. We expect to continue to increase our sales of saw and pulp logs to third parties. Average prices in U.S. dollars for consolidated saw and pulp log sales were US$25 per cubic meter in 2005, compared to US$20 in 2004. Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Saw and pulp log sales generated US$27.1 million, or 4.2% of our total net sales, in 2004 compared to US$18.2 million, or 3.8% of net sales, in 2003. Saw and pulp log physical volume sales increased by 43.0% from 951.9 thousand cubic meters in 2003 to 1,361.4 thousand cubic meters in 2004. This increase in physical volume sales is mainly attributable to sales that resulted from selling damaged trees knocked down during a severe wind storm in Chile as well as a general trend of having more saw and log capacity than our wood products production requires. We expect to continue to increase our sales of saw and pulp logs to third parties. Average prices in U.S. dollars for consolidated saw and pulp log sales were US$20 per cubic meter in 2004, compared to US$19 in 2003. Other products Other products include principally wood chips, sawdust, door parts, fiberboard doors and wood plies. Year ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 Net sales (millions of US$) $ 16.9 $20.6 $ 20.0 % of consolidated net sales 3.5% 3.2% 2.7% Net sales growth %  22.3% (2.7)% Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Other product sales generated US$20.0 million, or 2.7% of our total net sales, in 2005 compared to US$20.6 million, or 3.2% of net sales, in 2004. 81 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Other products sales generated US$20.6 million, or 3.2% of our total net sales, in 2004 compared to US$16.9 million, or 3.5% of net sales, in 2003. The increase in other product sales was due mainly to higher sales of wood chips, wood plies and door parts while fiberboard door sales were flat. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our principal sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, cash generated from operations and our ability to borrow under credit facilities. We are not seeking to raise new net long-term capital as we believe current cash reserves and operating sources are sufficient to cover our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Therefore, our financing activities relate principally to replacing our existing long-term credit sources as they periodically mature or when cost of debt may be reduced. However, if our planned capital expenditures change or increase, we may need to seek additional financing. The most significant financing events thus far in 2006 were (i) the issuance of public bonds by Masisa for an amount of US$163 million, which was used to prepay Terranovas A and B long term bond obligations and (ii) a new syndicated loan for an amount US$110 million, which was primarily used to prepay long term debt. The most significant financing event during 2005 after the Merger between Masisa and Terranova was the capital increase of US$117.5 million which is being used to finance the Companys plans for investment and construction of new plants. The capital increase was completed into two phases. The first phase, completed on December 7, 2005, yielded proceeds of US$75 million. The second phase of this process was completed on January 5, 2006. See Financing Activities in this Item. The company ended this period with cash and a cash equivalent balance of US$97.8 million. The most significant financing events during 2004 were five new long-term bank loans for an aggregate amount of US$47 million and the sale of US$73.2 million in forestry assets in Chile not deemed necessary for current operations. Cash generated in operating activities during the year and part of proceeds from the sale of forestry assets were used to pay or prepay short and long term financial debt, which was reduced by US$95.9 million during 2004. Although the company intended to further reduce financial debt, some of the maturing debt could not be prepaid in December 2004 due to contractual restrictions. The company ended the year with cash and a cash equivalent balance of US$58.5 million, which was mainly used to pay or prepay maturing debt during the first half of 2005. The most significant financing events during 2003 involved the issuance of public bonds by each of Terranova and Masisa, in aggregate amounts equal to US$148.8 million and US$91.2 million, respectively, and a capital increase by Terranova of US$90.6 million. Proceeds from the bonds and capital increase were used primarily to repay then existing bank and other borrowings with December 2003 and 2004 maturities. Dividend payments and the payment to shareholders of Terranova and Masisa that exercised their rights to withdraw from the respective company in which they held shares, which arose as a result of the merger of Terranova with Masisa, were financed by Terranova with existing cash balances and by Masisa with existing cash balances and new short-term borrowings. Operating activities Our net cash provided by operating activities was US$103.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to US$49.8 million for 2004. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 is explained in part by a 20% increase in collections from US$734.0 million in 2004 to US$879.9 million in the same period in 2005, which was mostly offset by a 15% increase in payments to suppliers, from US$650.5 million in 2004 to US$748.2 million in 2005. The increase in collections is explained by growth in net sales, due to higher physical volume sales, in conjunction with overall higher prices. Cash payments to suppliers also increased as a consequence of higher physical volumes produced and sold. In addition, financial revenues increased from US$1.9 million in 2004 to US$3.9 million in 2005. During 2005 the Company increased its income taxes and IVA 82 Table of Contents (value added tax) cash payments compared to 2004. Income tax payments have increased from US$6.9 million in 2004 to US$11.5 million in 2005, principally due to increased income tax payments in some of our Chilean and Venezuelan subsidiaries. Interest payments decreased from US$31.5 million in 2004 to US$27.8 million in 2005. This decrease is due mainly to lower consolidated financial debt and a lower interest rate environment. Our net cash provided by operating activities was US$49.8 million for the year 2004, compared to US$9.8 million for the same period in 2003. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 is mainly explained by a 38% increase in collections, from US$530.3 million in 2003 to US$734.0 million in 2004, which was partially offset by a 34% increase in payments to suppliers, from US$486.0 million in 2003 to US$650.5 million in 2004. The increase in collections is explained by the growth in net sales, as a result of the increases in volume sales, in conjunction with overall higher prices. Cash payments to suppliers also increased as a consequence of higher volumes produced and sold. During 2004 the Company reduced cash disbursements for interest payments, income taxes payments and VAT payments compared to 2003. Interest expense disbursements were reduced from US$36.3 million in 2003 to US$31.5 million in 2004. Reductions of interest payments are the consequence of: having a lower consolidated financial debt, the fact that the issuance expenses of the bonds issued by Masisa and Terranova were paid during 2003, and an environment with lower interest rates. Income tax payments have been reduced from US$13.9 million in 2003 to US$6.9 million in 2004, mainly due to the net loss experienced by the company during 2003. The corporate restructuring of Terranova in 2003 (merger of Millalemu S.A., Andinos S.A. and Forestal Terranova S.A.) permitted the Company to optimize its use of VAT tax credits in Chile. The Chilean tax authorities have challenged our treatment of these losses. For more information, see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income received is attributable primarily to VAT recovery due to exports. VAT recovery was lower in 2004, since stronger Latin American economies led the company to substitute exports for higher margin domestic sales. Net working capital rose as a consequence of higher sales. There were no material credit policy changes during this period. See, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 at page F-5. Investing activities The table below summarizes our significant capital spending by geographic segment for the 2005. For certain corporate level management purposes, as of the date of this document we group our geographic segments by country of origin only. However, our historical financial segment presentation for 2003, and for 2004, remain grouped by the former Terranova and Masisa businesses that existed prior to our merger on May 31, 2005 and represent the way management viewed our business. Accordingly, our period-on-period comparisons for our geographic segments for such annual periods are grouped and discussed by the former Terranova and Masisa business divisions. 83 Table of Contents Investing activities for the year ended 2005 Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$) 2005 United States $ 0.6 Chile 35.2 Venezuela 8.2 Brazil 18.6 Mexico 1.6 Argentina 8.8 Other 0.2 Total $73.2 Our capital expenditures incurred during 2005 were funded with internal cash generation, short-term and long-term bank loans.

All of these investments will be financed from operating cash flow and through some adjustments to the forestry portfolio by a divestment of approximately US$50 million. In Chile, the principal investment is the construction of a new MDF plant, and other investments that are expected to include new forest plantations, industrial upgrading and improvements. In Venezuela, the investment plan includes new forest plantations and industrial improvements. In Argentina, the investment plan includes mainly new forest plantations. In Brazil, the investments are expected to include chiefly new forest plantations and industrial efficiency improvements. In addition to our planned investments described above, we are in the advanced stages of studying several additional investments including an MDF plant in Brazil, a plywood plant in Chile and new forestry plantations in Chile, Argentina and Brazil. As part of the normal course of our business, we continue to review investment and acquisition opportunities in North America, Latin America and other regions in the world. 84 Table of Contents The table below summarizes our significant capital spending by geographic segment for 2003 and 2004.

Financing activities The most significant financing activities of Masisa are its long-term borrowings and long-term financing facilities, since short-term debt is mainly raised and repaid to adjust short-term needs to cash availability. Accordingly, the following paragraphs describe the long-term borrowings Masisa subscribed and/or repaid during the indicated periods. No seasonal factors materially affect our financing activities. 86 Table of Contents On January 12, 2006, Masisa announced the completion of a local bond offering for approximately US$163 million, denominated in Unidades de Fomento, a Chilean inflation  indexed currency unit. Among the offering participants were local pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, stockbrokers and banks. The most significant financing events during 2005 were: The successful completion of the merger by incorporation of Masisa into and with Terranova. The successful completion of a capital increase, with total proceeds of approximately US$117.5 million, divided into two phases. The first phase, completed on December 7, 2005, yielded proceeds of US$75 million. Of this amount, 66% was placed in the U.S. market via the Companys ADR program. The second phase of this process was completed on January 5, 2006, upon the completion of a preemptive rights offering period. The principal objectives of the capital increase were to finance part of the Companys investment projects, which include a new MDF plant in Chile. The signing of a syndicated credit contract between our subsidiary Masisa Overseas Ltd., as debtor, and the Cooperative Centrale Raiffelsen-Boerenleenbank B.A. (Rabobank International New York Branch, henceforth also known as Rabobank), as agency bank and creditor, together with a syndicate of banks, for US$110 million. This credit agreement has a six-year term and is guaranteed by Masisa and its subsidiaries, Masisa Argentina S.A. and Masisa do Brazil Ltd. The funds will be used for refinancing the companys financial liabilities. Masisas principal financing activities in 2005 related mainly to paying maturing long-term borrowings and dividends with cash and new short-term borrowings. Our short-term borrowings and long-term borrowings maturing within one year increased by US$239.8 million during 2005, from US$136.6 million on December 31, 2004. Our significant new short-term borrowings during the same period were bank loans, for an aggregate amount of US$66.3 million relating to several bank financings. Significant repayment of long-term borrowings during 2005 included the payment of US$35 million of partial maturities of long term debt and US$9 million of a partial maturity of a private placement. Masisas principal financing activities in the year 2004 related mainly to reducing short-term borrowings, replacing maturing long-term borrowings and the sale of approximately 21,000 hectares of our Chilean forests for US$73.2 million. Our short-term borrowings and long-term borrowings maturing within one year declined by US$80.9 million during 2004, from US$217.6 million on December 31, 2003 to US$136.6 million on December 31, 2004.
