Defined Terms Except as the context otherwise requires, the terms "Fluor" or the "Registrant" as used herein are references to Fluor Corporation and its predecessors and references to the "company," "we," "us," or "our" as used herein shall include Fluor Corporation, its consolidated subsidiaries and divisions. PART I Item 1. Business Fluor Corporation was incorporated in Delaware on September 11, 2000 prior to a reverse spin-off transaction involving the company's coal business. However, through our predecessors, we have been in business for over a century. Our principal executive offices are located at 6700 Las Colinas Boulevard, Irving, Texas 75039, and our telephone number is (469) 398-7000. Our common stock currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "FLR". Fluor Corporation is a holding company that owns the stock of a number of subsidiaries. Acting through these subsidiaries, we are one of the largest professional services firms providing engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and modularization, commissioning and maintenance as well as project management services on a global basis. We are an integrated solutions provider for our clients in a diverse set of industries worldwide including oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, transportation, mining and metals, power, life sciences and manufacturing. We are also a service provider to the U.S. 1 Table of Contents federal government and governments abroad; and we perform operations and maintenance activities globally for major industrial clients. Our business is aligned into five principal segments. The five segments are Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure, Government, Global Services and Power. Fluor Constructors International, Inc., which is organized and operates separately from the rest of our business, provides unionized management and construction services in the United States and Canada, both independently and as a subcontractor on projects in each of our segments. Financial information on our segments, as defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, is set forth on page F-46 of this annual report on Form 10-K under the caption "Operating Information by Segment," which is incorporated herein by reference. Competitive Strengths As an integrated world class solutions provider of engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication, maintenance and project management services, we believe that our business model allows us the opportunity to bring to our clients on a global basis capital efficient business offerings that combine excellence in execution, safety, cost containment and experience. In that regard, we believe that our business strategies, which are based on certain of our core competencies, provide us with some significant competitive advantages: Excellence in Execution Given our proven track record of project completion and client satisfaction, we believe that our ability to design, engineer, construct, commission and manage complex projects often in geographically challenging locations gives us a distinct competitive advantage. We strive to complete our projects meeting or exceeding all client specifications. In an increasingly competitive environment, we are also continually emphasizing cost and schedule controls so that we meet our clients' performance requirements as well as their schedule and budgetary needs. Financial Strength We believe that we are among the most financially sound companies in our industry. We strive to maintain a solid financial condition, placing an emphasis on having a strong balance sheet and an investment grade credit rating. Our financial strength provides us a valuable competitive advantage in terms of access to surety bonding capacity and letters of credit which are critical to our business. Our strong balance sheet also allows us to fund our strategic initiatives, pay dividends, repurchase stock, pursue opportunities for growth and better manage unanticipated cash flow variations. Safety One of our core values and a fundamental business strategy is our constant pursuit of safety. The maintenance of a safe and secure workplace is a key business driver for us and our clients. In the areas in which we provide our services, we have delivered and continue to deliver excellent safety performance, with our safety record being better than the industry average. In our experience, whether in an office or at a job-site, a safe environment decreases risks, assures a proper environment for all workers, enhances their morale and improves their productivity, reduces project cost and generally improves client relations. We believe that our safety record is one of our most distinguishing features. Global Execution Platform As the largest U.S.-based, publicly-traded engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and maintenance company, we have a global footprint with employees situated throughout the world. Our global presence allows us to build local relationships that permit us to capitalize on opportunities near these locations. It also allows us to mobilize quickly to project sites around the world. Market Diversity The company serves multiple markets across a broad spectrum of industries across the globe and offers a wide variety of engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and modularization, commissioning and maintenance services. We feel that our market diversity is a key strength of our company that helps to mitigate the impact of the cyclicality in the markets we serve. Just as important, our concentrated attention on market diversification allows us to achieve more consistent growth and deliver solid returns. We believe that our continued strategy of maintaining a good mixture within our entire business portfolio permits us to both focus on our more stable business markets and to 2 Table of Contents capitalize on developing our cyclical markets when the timing is appropriate. This strategy also allows us to better weather any downturns in a specific market by emphasizing markets that are strong. Client Relationships Our culture is based on putting the customer at the center of everything we do. We actively pursue relationships with new clients while at the same time building on our long-term relationships with existing clients. We continue to believe that long-term relationships with existing, sometimes decades-old, clients serves us well by allowing us to better understand and be more responsive to their requirements. Regardless of whether our clients are new or have been with us for many years, our ability to successfully foster relationships is a key driver to the success of our business. Risk Management We believe that our ability to assess, understand, gauge, mitigate and manage project risk, especially in difficult locations or circumstances or in a complicated contracting environment, provides us with a proven ability to deliver the project certainty our clients demand. We have an experienced management team, and utilize a systematic and disciplined approach towards managing risks. We believe that our comprehensive risk management approach allows us to better control costs and schedule, which in turn leads to clients who are satisfied with the delivered product. Integrated Solutions Through our integrated solutions offering, we can deliver to clients our broad range of engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication, equipment services, maintenance and management services and offerings in an integrated package. This approach spans the entire lifecycle of a project  from initial scoping and front end engineering to construction, fabrication, equipment and supply chain to post-completion operations and maintenance  thereby allowing us to bring our full breadth of resources to better solve client challenges and create opportunities. Our integrated solutions approach allows us to exercise better overall control of a project, in collaboration with our clients, which in turn results in more predictable and profitable results while enhancing the value, safety and efficiencies we can bring to a project. We believe we are one of the few industry players who have the capability to deliver integrated solutions to our client, which we believe is a clear differentiator for us. General Operations Our services fall into six broad categories: engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication, maintenance and project management. We offer these services independently as well as on a fully integrated basis. Our services can range from basic consulting activities, often at the early stages of a project, to complete design-build and maintenance contracts.  In engineering, our expertise ranges from traditional engineering disciplines such as piping, mechanical, electrical, control systems, civil, structural and architectural to advanced engineering specialties including process engineering, chemical engineering, simulation, enterprise integration, integrated automation processes and interactive 3-D modeling. As part of these services, we often provide master planning and conceptual design services, which allow us to align each project's function, scope, cost and schedule with the client's objectives in order to optimize project success. Also included within these services are such activities as feasibility studies, project development planning, technology evaluation, risk management assessment, global siting, constructability reviews, asset optimization and front-end engineering.  Our procurement organization offers traditional procurement services as well as supply chain solutions aimed at improving product quality and performance while also reducing project cost and schedule. Our clients benefit from our global sourcing and supply expertise, global purchasing power, technical knowledge, processes, systems and experienced global resources. Our traditional procurement activities include strategic sourcing, material management, contracts management, buying, expediting, supplier quality inspection and logistics.  In construction, we mobilize, execute, commission and demobilize projects on a self-perform or subcontracted basis. Generally, we are responsible for the completion of a project, often in difficult locations and under challenging circumstances. We are frequently designated as a program manager, where a client has facilities in multiple locations, complex phases in a single project 3 Table of Contents location, or a large-scale investment in a facility. Depending upon the project, we often serve as the primary contractor or we may act as a subcontractor to another party.  We also provide a variety of fabrication and modularization services, including integrated engineering and modular fabrication and assembly, modular construction and asset support services. We offer a range of options designed to meet the specific needs of our clients. By operating self-perform fabrication yards in key regions of the world, our off-site fabrication solutions help our clients achieve cost and schedule savings by reducing on-site craft needs and shifting work to inherently safer and more controlled work environments.  Under our operations and maintenance contracts, our clients ask us to operate and maintain large, complex facilities for them. We do so through the delivery of total maintenance services, facility management, plant readiness, commissioning, start-up and maintenance technology, small capital projects, turnaround and outage services, all on a global basis. Among other things, we can provide key management, staffing and management skills to clients on-site at their facilities. Our operations and maintenance activities also include routine and outage/turnaround maintenance services, general maintenance and asset management, emissions reduction technologies and services, and restorative, repair, predictive and prevention services. In December 2015, we announced the acquisition of Stork Holding B.V, a global provider of maintenance, modification and asset integrity services. Through this acquisition, we will significantly increase our operations and maintenance business while also enhancing our integrated solutions capabilities. This transaction is expected to close in the spring of 2016.  Project management, the primary responsibility of managing all aspects of the effort to deliver projects on schedule and within budget, is required on every project. We are often hired as the overall program manager on large complex projects where various contractors and subcontractors are involved and multiple activities need to be integrated to ensure the success of the overall project. Project management services include logistics, development of project execution plans, detailed schedules, cost forecasts, progress tracking and reporting, and the integration of the engineering, procurement and construction efforts. Project management is accountable to the client to deliver the safety, functionality and financial performance requirements of the project. We operate in five principal business segments, as described below. Oil & Gas Through our Oil & Gas segment, we have long served the global oil and gas production, processing, and chemical and petrochemical industries, as an integrated solutions provider offering a full range of design, engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and project management services to a broad spectrum of energy-related industries. We serve a number of specific industries including chemicals and petrochemicals, downstream refining, pipelines, upstream oil and gas production, liquefied natural gas ("LNG") and offshore production. While we perform projects that range greatly in size and scope, we believe that one of our distinguishing features is that we are one of the few companies that have the global strength and experience to perform extremely large projects in difficult locations. As the locations of large scale oil, gas and chemicals projects have become more challenging geographically, geopolitically or otherwise, we believe that clients will continue to look to us based upon our size, strength, global reach, experience and track-record to manage their complex projects. As the global economy becomes increasingly competitive, clients are placing more emphasis on capital efficient project execution. Also, in many of the countries where we work, clients are requiring more local content in their projects by mandating use of in-country talent and procurement of in-country goods and services. To meet these challenges, we continue to expand our footprint in growth regions by establishing local offices, forming strategic alliances with local partners, and emphasizing local training programs. We are also increasing our use of distributed execution centers such as our offices in Manila, Cebu and New Delhi where we can continue to provide superior services on a very cost-efficient basis. 4 Table of Contents With each specific project, our role can vary. We may be involved in providing front-end engineering, program management and final design services, construction management services, self-perform construction, or oversight of other contractors and we may also assume responsibility for the procurement of materials, equipment and subcontractors. We have the capacity to design and construct new facilities, upgrade, revamp and expand existing facilities, and rebuild facilities following fires and explosions. We also provide consulting services ranging from feasibility studies to process assessment to project finance structuring and studies. In the upstream sector, our clients need to develop additional and new sources of supply. Our typical projects in the upstream sector revolve around the production, processing and transporting of oil and gas resources, including the development of infrastructure associated with major new fields and pipelines, as well as LNG projects. We are also involved in offshore production facilities and in conventional and unconventional gas projects in various geographical locations. In the downstream sector, we continue to pursue significant global opportunities relating to refined products. Our clients are modernizing and modifying existing refineries to increase capacity and satisfy environmental requirements. We continue to play a strong role in each of these markets. We also remain focused on markets, such as clean fuels, where an increasing number of countries are implementing stronger environmental standards. In the chemicals and petrochemicals market, we have been very active for several years with major projects involving the expansion of ethylene based derivatives. The most active markets have been in the United States, Middle East and Asia, where there is significant demand for chemical products. With our partner Grupo ICA, we maintain a joint venture known as ICA Fluor, through which we continue to participate in the Mexican and Central American oil, gas, power, chemical and other markets. We are also focused on meeting the fabrication and modularization needs of our clients through a range of on-site and off-site options. We provide self-perform fabrication, integrated modular engineering fabrication and assembly, modular construction and asset support services to customers around the globe from our joint venture yards in Mexico, the Philippines, Russia and Canada. In 2015, we entered into a joint venture agreement to create an entity known as COOEC Fluor Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. ("CFHI"), which will provide us with the ability to produce cost effective and very large fabrication solutions to both the on-shore and off-shore markets, in a world-class, state-of-art facility located near Zhuhai, China. Through our procurement services, we also provide clients access to many independent fabrication facilities throughout the world. Industrial & Infrastructure The Industrial & Infrastructure segment provides design, engineering, procurement, construction, operations and maintenance and project management services to the transportation, commercial and institutional, manufacturing, life sciences, mining and metals, telecommunications, microelectronics and water sectors. These projects often require application of our clients' state-of-the-art processes and intellectual knowledge. We focus on providing our clients with capital efficiencies through solutions that seek to reduce costs and compress delivery schedules. By doing so, we are able to complete our clients' projects on a quick and more cost efficient basis. In addition, we also work closely with clients in these and other sectors, including clients in the oil and gas and chemicals industries, by providing operations and maintenance services to help them achieve operational improvements at new or existing facilities thereby allowing our clients to remain focused on their core business functions. In transportation, we focus on infrastructure projects, such as roads, highways, bridges and rail, with particular interest in large, complex projects. We provide a broad range of services including consulting, design, planning, financial structuring, engineering and construction, domestically and internationally. Our projects may involve the use of public/private partnerships, which allow us to develop and finance deals in concert with public entities for projects such as toll roads and rail lines that would not have otherwise been undertaken, had only public funding been available. And, from time to time, we may also be an equity 5 Table of Contents investor in such public/private partnership projects. As the global population continues to grow (especially in emerging countries) and existing infrastructure continues to age (especially in developed countries), we have won and will continue to pursue transportation projects on a global basis. In manufacturing, we provide design, engineering, procurement, consulting, construction and construction management services to a wide variety of industries. In life sciences, we provide design, engineering, procurement, construction and construction management services to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. We also specialize in providing validation and commissioning services where we not only bring new facilities into production but we also keep existing facilities operating. The ability to complete projects on a large scale basis, especially in a business where time to market is critical, allows us to better serve our clients and is a key competitive advantage. In mining and metals, we provide a full range of services to the iron ore, copper, diamond, gold, nickel, alumina, aluminum and other commodity-based industries. These services include feasibility studies through detailed engineering, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning and start-up support. We see many of these opportunities being developed in extreme altitudes, topographies and climates, such as the Andes Mountains, Mongolia, Western Australia and Africa. We are one of the few companies with the size and experience to execute large scale mining and metals projects in these difficult locations. Activities in the operations and maintenance markets include providing facility start-up and management, plant and facility maintenance, operations support and asset management services to the oil and gas, chemicals, life sciences, mining and metals, consumer products and manufacturing industries. We are a leading supplier of operations and maintenance services, providing our service offerings both domestically and internationally. This business often benefits from large projects that originate in another of our segments which can lead to long-term maintenance or operations opportunities. Conversely, our long-term maintenance contracts can lead to larger capital projects for our other business segments when that need arises. Government Our Government segment is a provider of engineering, construction, logistics, base and facilities operations and maintenance, contingency response and environmental and nuclear services to the U.S. government and governments abroad. Because the U.S. and other governments are the largest purchasers of outsourced services in the world, government work represents an attractive opportunity for the company. For the energy sector, we provide site management, environmental remediation, decommissioning, engineering and construction services and have been very successful in addressing the myriad environmental and regulatory challenges associated with these sites. Fluor performs significant activities as part of a joint venture that has responsibility for the Savannah River site near Aiken, South Carolina. Fluor-led teams are also responsible for certain decommissioning activities for the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE"), including the Gaseous Diffusion Plants in Pike County, Ohio (Portsmouth) and Paducah, Kentucky. Additionally, a Fluor-led team is providing operations and maintenance services with the Department of Energy at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in New Orleans, Louisiana. We are also serving government customers outside of the United States. For example, Fluor is part of a joint venture that is providing nuclear decommissioning services at 12 sites under the Magnox/Research Site Restoration Limited contract for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority in the United Kingdom and site and lab management services for Atomic Energy of Canada Limited at Chalk River, which is Canada's largest research and development complex for science and technology. The Government segment also provides engineering and construction services, logistics and life-support, as well as contingency operations support, to the defense sector. We support military logistical and infrastructure needs around the world. Specifically, we provide life-support, engineering, procurement, construction and logistical augmentation services to the U.S. military and coalition forces in various 6 Table of Contents international locations, with a primary focus on the United States military-related activities in and around the Middle East and more specifically in Afghanistan and Africa. Because of our strong network of global resources, we believe we are well-situated to efficiently and effectively mobilize the resources necessary for defense operations, even in the most remote and difficult locations to both traditional and U.S. government classified customers around the world. In combination with our subsidiary, Fluor Federal Solutions, we are a leading provider of outsourced services to the U.S. government. We provide operations and maintenance services at military bases and education and training services to the Department of Labor, particularly through Job Corps programs. In addition, we provide construction services to new and existing facilities for the U.S. military, the intelligence community and in support of foreign military sales programs. The company is also providing support to the Department of Homeland Security. We are particularly involved in supporting the U.S. government's rapid response capabilities to address security issues and disaster relief, the latter primarily through our long-standing relationship with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Global Services Consistent with our integrated solutions offerings, the Global Services segment represents a combination of other operating segments that provide a wide array of solutions to support projects across Fluor groups all over the world. Capabilities within Global Services include site equipment and tool services, industrial fleet services and staffing services. Global Services provides Site Services® and fleet management services through AMECO®. AMECO provides integrated construction equipment, tool, and fleet service solutions to the company and third party clients on a global basis for construction projects and plant sites. AMECO supports large construction projects and plants at locations throughout North and South America, Africa, the Middle East, Australia and Southeast Asia. Global Services serves the staffing market through TRS®. TRS is a global enterprise of staffing specialists that provides the company and third party clients with recruiting and permanent placement services and the placement of contract technical professionals. Power In the Power segment, we provide a full range of services to the gas fueled, solid fueled, environmental compliance, renewables, nuclear and power services markets. Our services include engineering, procurement, construction, program management, start-up and commissioning, operations and maintenance and technical services. Through the gas fueled market, we offer a full range of services for simple and combined cycle reference plant designs, as well as integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) projects. In the United States, investment in gas fueled plants is continuing to improve, driven by coal-fired plant retirements and low cost gas. We are also expanding our international operations in this market. Through the solid fueled and environmental compliance markets, we offer a full range of services for subcritical, supercritical, ultra-supercritical and circulating fluidized bed (CFB) technologies, as well as emissions reduction solutions including selective catalytic reduction (SCR), flue gas desulphurization (FGD), and particulate and mercury controls designs. As part of our environmental compliance service offering, we design, install and commission emissions reduction equipment in order to assist our clients with environmental guideline compliance which allows owners to comply with current emissions regulations. We also offer comprehensive solutions for post-combustion carbon capture and sequestration for solid fueled and gas fueled facilities on a global basis, offering our commercially demonstrated proprietary Econamine FG PlusSM CO2 capture technology. 7 Table of Contents In the renewables market, we offer a wide range of technology choices for solar, biomass and geothermal solutions on a global basis. For solar, we are strongly focused globally on thermal technologies such as photovoltaic (PV) as well as concentrating solar power (CSP) applications. In the biomass market, we bring proven expertise with small boiler and circulating fluidized bed technologies for projects using woody biomass and/or agricultural waste fuels. In nuclear, we announced in January 2016 that we had entered into contracting arrangements with Westinghouse Electric Company to manage the construction workforce at nuclear power plants located in Georgia and South Carolina (the "WEC Contracts"). With these awards and our 70 years of experience in the nuclear industry, we are strategically positioned to offer our extensive experience for new build plants, capital modifications, extended power uprate (EPU) projects and operations and maintenance services on a global basis. We also continue to invest in NuScale Power, LLC ("NuScale"), an Oregon-based small modular nuclear reactor ("SMR") technology company. NuScale is a leader in the development of light water, passively safe SMRs, which we believe will provide us with significant future opportunities. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Energy and NuScale entered into a cooperative agreement whereby the government will reimburse certain NuScale research and development efforts through 2019. Through our power services business line, we offer a variety of services to owners including fossil, renewable and nuclear plant maintenance, facility management, operations support, asset performance improvement, capital modifications and improvements, operations readiness and start-up commissioning on a global basis. We have annual maintenance and modification contracts covering full generation fleets within the utility generation market. Additionally, we provide a solution to the transmission and distribution market in the United States and South Africa. In the U.S. market, the scope of services is focused on the design and construction of new transmission lines to connect new capacity from the renewable energy facilities to existing distribution centers. Other Matters Backlog Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. The following table sets forth the consolidated backlog of the company's segments at December 31, 2015 and 2014: December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 (in millions) Oil & Gas $ 28,796 $ 28,493 Industrial & Infrastructure 5,600 7,194 Government(1) 3,560 4,741 Global Services   Power 6,770 2,054 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 44,726 $ 42,482 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (1)As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, total backlog includes $912 million and $2.1 billion, respectively, of unfunded government contracts. 8 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our consolidated backlog at December 31, 2015 and 2014 by region: December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 (in millions) United States $ 18,167 $ 14,424 Asia Pacific (including Australia) 2,678 3,153 Europe, Africa and Middle East 13,351 12,211 The Americas (excluding the United States) 10,530 12,694 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 44,726 $ 42,482 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ For purposes of the preceding tables, backlog for the Industrial & Infrastructure segment includes our operations and maintenance activities that have yet to be performed. U.S. government agencies operate under annual fiscal appropriations by Congress and fund various federal contracts only on an incremental basis. With respect to backlog in our Government segment, if a contract covers multiple years, we include the full contract award, whether funded or unfunded, excluding option periods. For our contingency operations, we include only those amounts for which specific task orders have been awarded. For projects related to proportionately consolidated joint ventures, we include only our percentage ownership of each joint venture's backlog. In 2016, we expect to perform approximately 38 percent of our total backlog reported as of December 31, 2015. In comparison, during the last five years we expected to annually perform an average of 54 percent of our total year end backlog in the subsequent fiscal year. The primary reason for the expected decline in the pace of performance of our backlog in 2016 relative to the average expected pace of performance over the past five years is due to client-driven delays in the execution of our contracts. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations, deferrals or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, and deferrals, as appropriate. Due to additional factors outside of our control, such as changes in project schedules, we cannot predict the portion of our December 31, 2015 backlog estimated to be performed annually subsequent to 2016. For additional information with respect to our backlog, please see "Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," below. Types of Contracts While the basic terms and conditions of the contracts that we perform may vary considerably, generally we perform our work under two types of contracts: (a) cost reimbursable contracts and (b) fixed-price, lump-sum and guaranteed maximum contracts. In some markets, we are seeing "hybrid" contracts containing both fixed-price and cost reimbursable elements. As of December 31, 2015, the following table breaks down the percentage and amount of revenue associated with these types of contracts for our existing backlog: December 31, 2015 (in millions) (percentage) Cost Reimbursable $ 34,705 78% Fixed-Price, Lump-Sum and Guaranteed Maximum $ 10,021 22% Under cost reimbursable contracts, the client reimburses our cost of performing a project and pays us a pre-determined or fixed fee, or a fee based upon a percentage of the cost incurred in completing the project. Our profit may be in the form of a fee, a simple mark-up applied to labor cost incurred in performing the contract, or a combination of the two. The fee element may also vary. The fee may be an incentive fee based upon achieving certain performance factors, milestones or targets; it may be a fixed amount in the contract; or it may be based upon a percentage of the cost incurred. 9 Table of Contents Our Government segment, primarily acting as a prime contractor or a major subcontractor for a number of government programs, generally performs its services under cost reimbursable contracts subject to applicable statutes and regulations. In many cases, these contracts include incentive fee arrangements. The programs in question often take many years to complete and may be implemented by the award of many different contracts. Some of our government contracts are known as indefinite delivery indefinite quantity ("IDIQ") agreements. Under these arrangements, we work closely with the government to define the scope and amount of work required based upon an estimate of the maximum amount that the government desires to spend. While the scope is often not initially fully defined or does not require any specific amount of work, once the project scope is determined, additional work may be awarded to us without the need for further competitive bidding. Fixed-price contracts include both lump-sum contracts and negotiated fixed-price contracts. Under lump-sum contracts, we typically bid against our competitors on a contract based upon specifications provided by the client. This type of contracting presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, or economic and other changes that may occur during the contract period. Under negotiated fixed-price contracts, we are selected as contractor first, and then we negotiate price with the client. Negotiated fixed-price contracts frequently occur in single-responsibility arrangements where we perform some of the work before negotiating the total price for the project. Another type of fixed-price contract is a unit price contract under which we are paid a set amount for every "unit" of work performed. If we perform well under these types of contracts, we can benefit from cost savings; however, if the project does not proceed as originally planned, we generally cannot recover cost overruns except in certain limited situations. Guaranteed maximum price contracts are cost reimbursable contracts except that the total fee plus the total cost cannot exceed an agreed upon guaranteed maximum price. We can be responsible for some or all of the total cost of the project if the cost exceeds the guaranteed maximum price. Where the total cost is less than the negotiated guaranteed maximum price, we may receive the benefit of the cost savings based upon a negotiated agreement with the client. Competition We are one of the world's largest providers of engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication, operations and maintenance services. The markets served by our business are highly competitive and, for the most part, require substantial resources and highly skilled and experienced technical personnel. A large number of companies are competing in the markets served by our business, including U.S.-based companies such as Bechtel Group, Inc., CH2M Hill Companies, Ltd., Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc., KBR, Inc., Kiewit Corporation, Granite Construction, Inc. and AECOM Technology Corporation, and international-based companies such as AMEC Foster Wheeler plc, Balfour Beatty, Chicago Bridge and Iron Company N.V., Chiyoda Corporation, Hyundai Engineering & Construction Company, JGC Corporation, SNC-Lavalin Group, Inc., Samsung Engineering, Technip and WorleyParsons Limited. In the engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction arena, which is served by our Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure and Power segments, competition is based on an ability to provide the design, engineering, planning, management and project execution skills required to complete complex projects in a safe, timely and cost-efficient manner. Our engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction business derives its competitive strength from our diversity, excellence in execution, reputation for quality, technology, cost-effectiveness, worldwide procurement capability, project management expertise, geographic coverage, ability to meet client requirements by performing construction on either a union or an open shop basis, ability to execute projects of varying sizes, strong safety record and lengthy experience with a wide range of services and technologies. In the operations and maintenance markets, barriers to entry are both financially and logistically low, with the result that the industry is highly fragmented with no single company being dominant. Competition in those markets is generally driven by reputation, price and the capacity to perform. 10 Table of Contents The various markets served by the Global Services segment, while having some similarities to the construction and procurement arena, tend also to have discrete issues impacting individual units. Each of the markets we serve has a large number of companies competing in its markets. The equipment sector, which operates in numerous markets, is highly fragmented and very competitive, with a large number of competitors mostly operating in specific geographic areas. The competition in the equipment sector for larger capital project services is more narrow and limited to only those capable of providing comprehensive equipment, tool and management services. Temporary staffing is a highly fragmented market with over 1,000 companies competing globally. The key competitive factors in this business line are price, service, quality, breadth of service and the ability to identify and retain qualified personnel and geographical coverage. Key competitive factors in our Government segment are primarily centered on performance and the ability to provide the design, engineering, planning, management and project execution skills required to complete complex projects in a safe, timely and cost-efficient manner. Significant Clients For 2015, revenue earned from agencies of the U.S. government and Exxon Mobil Corporation accounted for 12 percent and 11 percent, respectively, of our total revenue. We perform work for these clients under multiple contracts and sometimes through joint venture arrangements. Raw Materials The principal products we use in our business include structural steel, metal plate, concrete, cable and various electrical and mechanical components. These products and components are subject to raw material (aluminum, copper, nickel, iron ore, etc.) availability and commodity pricing fluctuations, which we monitor on a regular basis. We have access to numerous global supply sources and we do not foresee any unavailability of these items that would have a material adverse effect on our business in the near term. However, the availability of these products, components and raw materials may vary significantly from year to year due to various factors including client demand, producer capacity, market conditions and specific material shortages. Research and Development Aside from our investment in NuScale, we generally do not engage in significant research and development efforts for new products and services and, during the past three fiscal years, we have not incurred cost for company-sponsored or client-sponsored research and development activities which would be material, special or unusual in any of our business segments. See "Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Power" for further discussion of the operations of NuScale. Patents We hold patents and licenses for certain items that we use in our operations, including those held by NuScale. However, none is so essential that its loss would materially affect our business. Environmental, Safety and Health Matters In our business, we engage in the design, engineering, construction, construction management, fabrication and operations and maintenance at sites throughout the world. Work at some of these sites involves activities related to nuclear facilities, hazardous waste, hydrocarbon production, distribution and transport, the military and infrastructure. Some of our work can be performed adjacent to environmentally sensitive locations such as wetlands, lakes and rivers. We also contract with the U.S. federal government to remediate hazardous materials, including chemical agents and weapons, as well as to decontaminate and decommission nuclear sites. These activities can require us to manage, handle, remove, treat, transport and dispose of toxic, radioactive or hazardous substances. Significant fines, penalties and other sanctions may 11 Table of Contents arise under environmental health and safety laws and regulations, and many of these laws call for joint and several and/or strict liability, which can render a party liable without regard to negligence or fault of such person. We believe, based upon present information available to us, that we are generally compliant with all such environmental health and safety laws and regulations. We further believe that our accruals with respect to future environmental cost are adequate and any future cost will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or competitive position. Some factors, however, could result in additional expenditures or the provision of additional accruals in expectation of such expenditures. These include the imposition of more stringent requirements under environmental laws or regulations, new developments or changes regarding site cleanup cost or the allocation of such cost among potentially responsible parties, or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at sites other than those currently identified.

Item 1A. Risk Factors We are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets we serve. The demand for our services is dependent upon the existence of projects with engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and management needs. Current economic conditions and commodity prices have adversely affected our clients' interest in approving new projects, have reduced our clients' budgets for capital expenditures and have otherwise caused a slowdown in the services our clients require. For example, we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from companies in the oil and gas industry, a historically cyclical industry that is significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices. Recent and/or continuing declines in oil or natural gas prices or activities could materially adversely affect the demand for our services in our Oil & Gas segment. In both our Oil & Gas segment and mining and metals business line of the Industrial & Infrastructure segment, capital expenditures by our clients may be influenced by factors such as prevailing prices and expectations about future prices for underlying commodities, technological advances, the costs of exploration, production and delivery of product, domestic and international political, military, regulatory and economic conditions and other similar factors. In our Power segment, new order activity has continued to see relatively low demand for our services in power due to political and environmental concerns regarding coal-fired power plants and safety and environmental concerns in the nuclear sector. In our mining and metal business line of the Industrial & Infrastructure segment, new order activity has also shown continued slowing due in part to volatility in the commodities and capital markets, which have caused clients in this segment to re-evaluate their needs for future capital improvements. Industries such as these and many of the others we serve have historically 14 Table of Contents been and will continue to be vulnerable to general downturns, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the demand for our services. Our revenue and earnings are largely dependent on the award of new contracts which we do not directly control. A substantial portion of our revenue and earnings is generated from large-scale project awards. The timing of project awards is unpredictable and outside of our control. Awards, including expansions of existing projects, often involve complex and lengthy negotiations and competitive bidding processes. These processes can be impacted by a wide variety of factors including a client's decision to not proceed with the development of a project, governmental approvals, financing contingencies, commodity prices, environmental conditions and overall market and economic conditions. We may not win contracts that we have bid upon due to price, a client's perception of our ability to perform and/or perceived technology advantages held by others. Many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or terms and conditions in a contract that we might not deem acceptable especially when the markets for the services we typically offer are relatively soft. Because a significant portion of our revenue is generated from large projects, our results of operations can fluctuate quarterly and annually depending on whether and when large project awards occur and the commencement and progress of work under large contracts already awarded. As a result, we are subject to the risk of losing new awards to competitors or the risk that revenue may not be derived from awarded projects as quickly as anticipated. We may experience reduced profits or losses under contracts if costs increase above estimates. Generally our business is performed under contracts that include cost and schedule estimates in relation to our services. Inaccuracies in these estimates may lead to cost overruns that may not be paid by our clients thereby resulting in reduced profits or losses. If a contract is significant or there are one or more events that impact a contract or multiple contracts, cost overruns could have a material impact on our reputation or our financial results, negatively impacting our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Approximately 22 percent of the dollar-value of our backlog is currently fixed-price contracts, where we bear a significant portion of the risk for cost overruns. Reimbursable contract types, such as those that include negotiated hourly billing rates, may restrict the kinds or amounts of costs that are reimbursable, therefore exposing us to risk that we may incur certain costs in executing these contracts that are above our estimates and not recoverable from our clients. If we fail to accurately estimate the resources and time necessary for these types of contracts, or fail to complete these contracts within the timeframes and costs we have agreed upon, there could be a material impact on our financial results as well as our reputation. In some markets, there is a trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements. Typically, our incentive fees are based on achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall safety performance, overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria. If we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee. In other cases, our fee will not change but we will have to continue to perform work without additional fee until the performance criteria is achieved. In both instances, this could result in lower than expected gross margins. Accordingly, for these and other reasons, there is no assurance that the contracts in our backlog, assuming they produce the revenue expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we expect or have realized in the past. Risks under our contracts which could result in cost overruns, project delays or other problems can also include:  Difficulties related to the performance of our clients, partners, subcontractors, suppliers or other third parties;  Changes in local laws or difficulties or delays in obtaining permits, rights of way or approvals;  Unanticipated technical problems, including design or engineering issues; 15 Table of Contents  Insufficient or inadequate project execution tools and systems needed to record, track, forecast and control cost and schedule;  Unforeseen increases in or failures to properly estimate the cost of raw materials, components, equipment, labor or the inability to timely obtain them;  Delays or productivity issues caused by weather conditions;  Incorrect assumptions related to productivity, scheduling estimates or future economic conditions; and  Project modifications creating unanticipated costs or delays. These risks tend to be exacerbated for longer-term contracts because there is increased risk that the circumstances under which we based our original cost estimates or project schedules will change with a resulting increase in costs. In many of these contracts, we may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred, and if a project is not executed on schedule, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. In addition, these losses may be material and can, in some circumstances, equal or exceed the full value of the contract. In such events, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be negatively impacted. Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and, therefore, may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue or earnings. As of December 31, 2015, our backlog was approximately $44.7 billion. Our backlog generally consists of projects for which we have an executed contract or commitment with a client and reflects our expected revenue from the contract or commitment, which is often subject to revision over time. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable or will not be subject to delay or suspension. Project cancellations, scope adjustments or deferrals may occur with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn; or, may cause the rate at which we perform on our backlog to decrease. Most of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them allowing clients to cancel projects already awarded to us. In addition, projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time. During periods of economic slowdown or decreases in commodity prices, the risk of backlog projects being suspended, delayed or cancelled generally increases. Finally, poor project or contract performance could also impact our backlog and profits. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and our profits. Intense competition in the global engineering, procurement and construction industry could reduce our market share and profits. We serve markets that are highly competitive and in which a large number of multinational companies compete. These markets can require substantial resources and investment in technology and skilled personnel. We also see a continuing influx of non-traditional competitors offering below-market pricing while accepting greater risk. Competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins, and may force us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are not normal or customary, thereby increasing the risk that we may have losses on such contracts. Intense competition is expected to continue in these markets, presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins. If we are unable to meet these competitive challenges, we could lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our profits. Current global economic conditions will likely affect a portion of our client base, partners, subcontractors and suppliers and could materially affect our backlog and profits. Current global economic conditions, including a decline in commodity prices and currency devaluations, have reduced and continue to negatively impact our clients' willingness and ability to fund their projects. These conditions make it difficult for our clients to accurately forecast and plan future 16 Table of Contents business trends and activities, thereby causing our clients to slow or even curb spending on our services, or seek contract terms more favorable to them. Our government clients may face budget deficits or financial sequestration that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing projects or that cause them to exercise their right to terminate our contracts with little or no prior notice. Furthermore, any financial difficulties suffered by our partners, subcontractors or suppliers could increase our cost or adversely impact project schedules. These economic conditions have reduced to some extent the availability of liquidity and credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide. Current financial market conditions and adverse credit market conditions could adversely affect our clients', our partners' or our own borrowing capacity, which support the continuation and expansion of projects worldwide, and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project award and execution delays, payment delays or defaults by our clients. Our ability to expand our business would be limited if, in the future, we are unable to access sufficient credit capacity, including capital market funding, bank credit, such as letters of credit, and surety bonding on favorable terms or at all. These disruptions could materially impact our backlog and profits. Finally, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy, and therefore may not recover as quickly as the economy as a whole. We have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties and risks. Unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions, increased cost and potential losses. Our business is subject to international economic and political conditions that change (sometimes frequently) for reasons which are beyond our control. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 59 percent of our backlog consisted of revenue to be derived from projects and services to be completed outside the United States. We expect that a significant portion of our revenue and profits will continue to come from international projects for the foreseeable future. Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks including:  abrupt changes in foreign government policies, laws, treaties, regulations or leadership;  embargoes or other trade restrictions, including sanctions;  restrictions on currency movement;  tax increases;  currency exchange rate fluctuations;  changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;  U.S. government policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we or our clients operate;  international hostilities; and  unrest, civil strife, acts of war, terrorism and insurrection. Also, the lack of a well-developed legal system in some of the countries where we operate may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights or to defend ourself against claims made by others. We operate in countries where there is a significant amount of political risk including the Middle East, Kazakhstan, Russia, China, and Argentina. In addition, military action or continued unrest could impact the supply or pricing of oil, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere, and increase our security costs. Our level of exposure to these risks will vary on each project, depending on the location of the project and the particular stage of each such project. For example, our risk exposure with respect to a project in an early development phase, such as engineering, will generally be less than our risk exposure on a project that is in the construction phase. To the extent that our international business is affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions and risks, we may experience project disruptions and losses. Project disruptions and losses could significantly reduce our overall revenue and profits. 17 Table of Contents Our use of teaming arrangements and joint ventures, which are important to our business, exposes us to risk and uncertainty because the success of those ventures depends on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners over whom we may have little or no control. The failure of our venture partners to perform their venture obligations could impose additional financial and performance obligations on us that could result in reduced profits or, in some cases, significant losses for us with respect to the venture. In the ordinary course of business, and as has become increasingly common in our industry, we execute specific projects and otherwise conduct certain operations through joint ventures, consortiums, partnerships and other collaborative arrangements (collectively, "ventures"), including ICA Fluor and CFHI. We have various ownership interests in these ventures, with such ownership typically being proportionate to our decision-making and distribution rights. The ventures generally contract directly with the third party client; however, services may be performed directly by the venture, or may be performed by us, our partners, or a combination thereof. Our success in many of our markets is dependent, in part, on the presence or capability of a local partner. If we are unable to compete alone, or with a quality partner, our ability to win work and successfully complete our contracts may be impacted. Differences in opinions or views between venture partners can result in delayed decision-making or failure to agree on material issues which could adversely affect the business and operations of our ventures. In many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures, it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement. At times, we also participate in ventures where we are not a controlling party. In such instances, we may have limited control over venture decisions and actions, including internal controls and financial reporting which may have an impact on our business. To the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture, if internal control problems arise within the joint venture, or if our joint venture partner has financial or operational issues, there could be a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. From time to time in order to establish or preserve a relationship, or to better ensure venture success, we may accept risks or responsibilities for the venture which are not necessarily proportionate with the reward we expect to receive or which may differ from risks or responsibilities we would normally accept in our own operations. The success of these and other ventures also depends, in large part, on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners of their venture obligations, including their obligation to commit working capital, equity or credit support as required by the venture and to support their indemnification and other contractual obligations. If our venture partners fail to satisfactorily perform their venture obligations the venture may be unable to adequately perform or deliver its contracted services. Under these circumstances, we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery by the venture of the contracted services and to meet any performance guarantees. We may also be subject to joint and several liability for our venture partners under the applicable contracts for venture projects. These additional obligations could result in reduced profits or, in some cases, increased liabilities or significant losses for us with respect to the venture, and in turn, our business and operations. In addition, a failure by a venture partner to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact our business and could result in fines, penalties, suspension or in the case of government contracts even debarment. Cyber-security breaches of our systems and information technology could adversely impact our ability to operate. We utilize, develop, install and maintain a number of information technology systems both for us and for others. Various privacy and security laws require us to protect sensitive and confidential information from disclosure. In addition, we are bound by our client and other contracts, as well as our own business practices, to protect confidential and proprietary information (whether it be ours or a third party's information entrusted to us) from disclosure. Our computer systems face the threat of unauthorized access, computer hackers, viruses, malicious code, cyber attacks and other security incursions and system disruptions, including attempts to improperly access our confidential and proprietary information as well as the confidential and proprietary information of our clients and other business partners. While we 18 Table of Contents endeavor to maintain industry-accepted security measures and technology to secure our computer systems, these systems and the information stored on these systems may still be subject to threats. A party who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate confidential or proprietary information, or could cause damage or interruptions to our systems. Any of these events could damage our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, we are involved in litigation proceedings, potential liability claims and contract disputes which may reduce our profits. We may be subject to a variety of legal proceedings, liability claims or contract disputes in virtually every part of the world. We engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage. In addition, the nature of our business results in clients, subcontractors and suppliers occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually liable. We have been and may in the future be named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters. During times of economic downturns, especially with regard to commodity-based clients, claim frequencies and amounts tend to increase. In proceedings when it is determined that we have liability, we may not be covered by insurance or, if covered, the dollar amount of these liabilities may exceed our policy limits. In addition, even where insurance is maintained for such exposure, the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims. Our professional liability coverage is on a "claims-made" basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period currently in effect. Any liability not covered by our insurance, in excess of our insurance limits or, if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, could result in a significant loss for us, and reduce our cash available for operations. In other legal proceedings, liability claims or contract disputes, we may be covered by indemnification agreements which may at times be difficult to enforce. Even if enforceable, it may be difficult to recover under these agreements if the indemnitor does not have the ability to financially support the indemnity. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If we were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. For further information on matters in dispute, please see "14. Contingencies and Commitments" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If we experience delays and/or defaults in client payments, we could suffer liquidity problems or we could be unable to recover all expenditures. Because of the nature of our contracts, we sometimes commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from clients in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures as they are incurred. Some of our clients may find it increasingly difficult to pay invoices for our services timely, especially as commodity prices decrease and remain low, increasing the risk that our accounts receivable could become uncollectible and ultimately be written off. In certain cases, our clients for our large projects are project-specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project. From time to time it may be difficult for us to collect payments owed to us by these clients. In addition, client may request extension of the payment terms otherwise agreed to under our contracts. Delays in client payments may require us to make a working capital investment, which could impact our cash flows and liquidity. If a client fails to pay invoices on a timely basis or defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted significant resources, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. Our failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners, subcontractors or suppliers for payment or performance could have a material effect on our financial results. We occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. Similarly, we present change orders and claims to our subcontractors and suppliers. If we fail to properly document the nature of change orders or claims, 19 Table of Contents or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating a reasonable settlement, we could incur reduced profits, cost overruns and in some cases a loss on the project. These types of claims can often occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, which result in additional cost, both direct and indirect. From time to time, these claims can be the subject of lengthy and costly proceedings, and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results. If we guarantee the timely completion or performance standards of a project, we could incur additional cost to cover our guarantee obligations. In some instances and in many of our fixed-price contracts, we guarantee to a client that we will complete a project by a scheduled date. We sometimes warrant that a project, when completed, will also achieve certain performance standards. From time to time, we may also assume a project's technical risk, which means that we may have to satisfy certain technical requirements of a project despite the fact that at the time of project award we may not have previously produced the system or product in question. Also, our contracts typically include limited warranties, providing assurances to clients that our completed work will meet industry standards of quality. If we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled, or if the project subsequently fails to meet guaranteed performance or quality standards, we may be held responsible under the guarantee or warranty provisions of our contract for cost impacts to the client resulting from any delay or the cost to cause the project to achieve the performance standards, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages or an obligation to re-perform substandard work. To the extent that these events occur, the total cost of the project (including any liquidated damages we become liable to pay) could exceed our original estimates and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. Our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty engineering or similar professional services. Because our projects are often technically complex, our failure to make judgments and recommendations in accordance with applicable professional standards, including engineering standards, could result in damages. Our business involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure. While we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages, and although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability, warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. These liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate, or could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future. In addition, clients, subcontractors or suppliers who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. An uninsured claim, either in part or in whole, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a substantial impact on our operations. We are dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors to complete many of our contracts. Much of the work performed under our contracts is actually performed by third-party subcontractors. We also rely on third-party suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. If we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired. If the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a fixed-price type contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. If a supplier or subcontractor fails to provide supplies, technology, equipment or services as required under a contract to us, our joint venture partner, our client or any other party involved in the project for any reason, or provides supplies, technology, equipment or services that are not an acceptable quality, we may be required to source those supplies, technology, equipment or 20 Table of Contents services on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated, which could impact contract profitability. In addition, faulty workmanship, equipment or materials could impact the overall project, resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications. These risks may be intensified during the current economic downturn if these suppliers or subcontractors experience financial difficulties or find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to fund their operations or access to bonding, and are not able to provide the services or supplies necessary for our business. In addition, in instances where Fluor relies on a single contracted supplier or subcontractor or a small number of suppliers or subcontractors, if a subcontractor or supplier were to fail there can be no assurance that the marketplace can provide replacement technology, equipment, materials or services in a timely basis or at the costs we had anticipated. A failure by a third-party subcontractor or supplier to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact our business and could result in fines, penalties, suspension or in the case of government contracts even debarment. Our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control. Extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, could negatively impact our ability to operate or increase our costs to operate. As an example, from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in delays in our operations; evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services; increased labor and material costs or shortages; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. We may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or man-made disasters, unless a contract provision provides us with relief from our obligations. The extra costs incurred as a result of these events may not be reimbursed by our clients. If we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or man-made disaster, our operations may be significantly affected, which could have a negative impact on our operations. In addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits and result in losses. Our U.S. government contracts and contracting rights may be terminated or otherwise adversely impacted at any time, and our inability to win or renew government contracts during regulated procurement processes could harm our operations and reduce our projects and revenues. We enter into significant government contracts, from time to time, such as those contracts that we have in place with the U.S. Department of Energy and Department of Defense. U.S. government contracts are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by government representatives and profit and cost controls, which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us. U.S. government contracts are also subject to uncertainties associated with Congressional funding, including the potential impacts of budget deficits and federal sequestration. A significant portion of our business is derived as a result of U.S. government regulatory, military and infrastructure priorities. Changes in these priorities, which can occur due to policy changes or changes in the economy, could adversely impact our revenues. For example, the U.S. government has continued to close bases in Afghanistan where we have performed significant work under the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program ("LOGCAP IV"). Moreover, existing contracts we are operating under could be moved from one government department to another which could result in a termination of that contract. The U.S. government is under no obligation to maintain program funding at any specific level and funds for a program may even be eliminated. Our U.S. government clients may terminate or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. In addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to specific regulations such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR"), the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Cost Accounting Standards ("CAS"), the Service Contract Act and Department of Defense security regulations. Failure to comply with any of these regulations and other government requirements may result in contract price adjustments, financial penalties or contract termination. Our U.S. government contracts are also subject to audits, cost reviews and investigations by U.S. government contracting oversight agencies such as the U.S. Defense Contract 21 Table of Contents Audit Agency (the "DCAA"). The DCAA reviews the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies (including our labor, billing, accounting, purchasing, estimating, compensation and management information systems). The DCAA also has the ability to review how we have accounted for costs under the FAR and CAS. The DCAA presents its report findings to the Defense Contract Management Agency ("DCMA"). Should the DCMA determine that we have not complied with the terms of our contract and applicable statutes and regulations, or if they believe that we have engaged in inappropriate accounting or other activities, payments to us may be disallowed or we could be required to refund previously collected payments. Additionally, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, suspension or debarment from future government contracts, and qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the U.S. government under the False Claims Act, which could include claims for treble damages. Furthermore, in this environment, if we have significant disagreements with our government clients concerning costs incurred, negative publicity could arise which could adversely affect our industry reputation and our ability to compete for new contracts. Most U.S. government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. The U.S. government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contracts with pre-established terms and conditions that generally require those contractors that have been previously awarded the contract to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under the contract. Such processes require successful contractors to anticipate requirements and develop rapid-response bid and proposal teams as well as dedicated supplier relationships and delivery systems to react to these needs. We face rigorous competition and significant pricing pressures in order to win these task orders. If we are not successful in reducing costs or able to timely respond to government requests, we may not win additional awards. Moreover, even if we are qualified to work on a government contract, we may not be awarded the contract because of existing government policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minority contractors. Our inability to win or renew government contracts during the procurement processes could harm our operations and reduce our profits and revenues. Many of our U.S. government contracts require security clearances. Depending upon the level of clearance required, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees are unable to obtain or retain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business, and our existing government clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them, thus adversely affecting our revenues. If one or more of our U.S. government contracts are terminated for any reason including for convenience, if we are suspended or debarred from U.S. government contract work, or if payment of our cost is disallowed, we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenue and profits. Employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits. Misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with anti-corruption, export control and environmental regulations; federal procurement regulations, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts and regulations regarding the protection of sensitive government information; regulations on lobbying or similar activities; regulations pertaining to the internal control over financial reporting; and, various other applicable laws or regulations. The precautions we take to prevent and detect fraud, misconduct or failures to comply with applicable laws and regulations may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of fraud or misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with government agencies, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profits. 22 Table of Contents Changes in our effective tax rate and tax positions may vary. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, in any country in which we operate could result in a higher tax rate on our earnings, which could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities, and our tax estimates and tax positions could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. A significant increase in our tax rate could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and liquidity. Systems and information technology interruption, as well as new systems implementation, could adversely impact our ability to operate and our operating results. As a global company, we are heavily reliant on computer, information and communications technology and related systems in order to operate. From time to time, we experience system interruptions and delays that may be planned for upgrades or that may be unplanned. Unplanned interruptions include natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar events or disruptions. Any of these or other events could cause system interruption, delays, loss of critical or sensitive data (including private data) or loss of funds; could delay or prevent operations (including the processing of transactions and reporting of financial results); and could adversely affect our reputation or our operating results. We continue to evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment, to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons. The implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. And, our systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. Systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials or others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our personnel concerning anti-bribery laws and issues, and we also inform our partners, subcontractors, suppliers, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf that they must comply with anti-bribery law requirements. We also have procedures and controls in place to monitor compliance. We cannot assure that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the possible reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including our partners, agents, subcontractors or suppliers), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Litigation or investigations relating to alleged or suspected violations of anti-bribery laws, even if ultimately such litigation or investigations demonstrate that we did not violate anti-bribery laws, could be costly and could divert management's attention away from other aspects of our business. 23 Table of Contents We could be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with domestic and international import and export laws. Our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis. Our policies mandate strict compliance with U.S. and foreign international trade laws. To the extent we export technical services, data and products outside of the United States, we are subject to U.S. and international laws and regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control with the Department of Treasury. From time to time, we identify certain inadvertent or potential export or related violations. These violations may include, for example, transfers without required governmental authorization. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the imposition of fines, the denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts. Past and future environmental, safety and health regulations could impose significant additional cost on us that reduce our profits. We are subject to numerous environmental laws and health and safety regulations. Our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, including nuclear and other radioactive materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities. It is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and effect of judicial, legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations. The applicable regulations, as well as the technology and length of time available to comply with those regulations, continue to develop and change. The cost of complying with rulings and regulations, satisfying any environmental remediation requirements for which we are found responsible, or satisfying claims or judgments alleging personal injury, property damage or natural resource damages as a result of exposure to or contamination by hazardous materials, including as a result of commodities such as lead or asbestos-related products, could be substantial, may not be covered by insurance, could reduce our profits and therefore could materially impact our future operations. In addition, risks associated with nuclear projects, due to their size, construction duration and complexity, may be increased by new and modified permitting, licensing and regulatory approvals and requirements that can be even more stringent and time consuming than similar conventional projects. Our company, along with our investment in NuScale, is subject to a number of regulations such as the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and non-U.S. regulatory bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Commission and the European Union, which can have a substantial effect on our nuclear operations and investments. Delays in receiving necessary approvals, permits or licenses, the failure to maintain sufficient compliance programs, and other problems encountered during construction (including changes to such regulatory requirements) could significantly increase our costs or have an adverse effect on our results of operations, our return on investments, our financial position and our cash flow. A substantial portion of our business is generated either directly or indirectly as a result of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to environmental matters. A reduction in the number or scope of these laws or regulations, or changes in government policies regarding the funding, implementation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, could significantly reduce the size of one of our markets and limit our opportunities for growth or reduce our revenue below current levels. If we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services, it could adversely affect our business and financial condition. We provide services to the U.S. Department of Energy and the nuclear energy industry in the on-going maintenance and modification of nuclear facilities as well as decontamination and decommissioning activities of nuclear plants. The Price-Anderson Act generally indemnifies parties performing services to nuclear power plants and Department of Energy contractors; however, not all activities we engage in on behalf of our clients are covered. Thus, if the Price-Anderson Act 24 Table of Contents indemnification protections do not apply to our services, or if the exposure occurs outside of the United States in a region that does not have protections comparable to the Price-Anderson Act, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by our client's refusal to contract with us, by our inability to obtain commercially reasonable insurance or third party indemnification, or by the potentially significant monetary damages we could incur. Through a joint venture, we also provide services to the United Kingdom's Nuclear Decommissioning Agency ("NDA") relating to the clean up and decommissioning of certain public sector sites in the United Kingdom. Indemnification provisions under the Nuclear Installations Act of 1965 available to nuclear site licensees, the Atomic Energy Authority and the Crown, and contractual indemnification from the NDA do not apply to every liability that we might incur while performing services for the NDA. If the Nuclear Installations Act of 1965 and contractual indemnification provisions do not apply to our services or if our exposure occurs outside of the United Kingdom, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. Foreign currency risks could have an adverse impact on company revenue, earnings and/or backlog. Certain of our contracts subject us to foreign currency risk, particularly when project contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. In addition, our operational cash flows and cash balances, though predominately held in U.S. dollars, may consist of different currencies at various points in time in order to execute our project contracts globally and meet transactional requirements. We may attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency risk by obtaining contract provisions that protect us from foreign currency fluctuations and/or by implementing hedging strategies utilizing derivatives as hedging instruments. However, these actions may not always eliminate all foreign currency risk, and as a result our profitability on certain projects could be affected. Our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies are subject to currency fluctuations when measured period to period for financial reporting purposes. In addition, the U.S. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly due to foreign currency volatility. We may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund our operations in other countries. The company's reported revenue and earnings of foreign subsidiaries could be affected by foreign currency volatility. Revenue, cost and earnings of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. If the U.S. dollar appreciates against a foreign subsidiary's non-U.S. dollar functional currency, the company would report less revenue, cost and earnings in U.S. dollars than it would have had the U.S. dollar depreciated against the same foreign currency or if there had been no change in the exchange rate. Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to adequately protect intellectual property rights. Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to differentiate our services through our technologies and know-how. This success includes the ability of companies in which we invest, such as NuScale to protect their intellectual property rights. We rely principally on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements to protect our interests. However, these methods only provide a limited amount of protection and may not adequately protect our interests. This can be especially true in certain foreign countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We cannot provide assurances that others will not independently develop technology substantially similar to our trade secret technology or that we can successfully preserve our intellectual property rights in the future. Our intellectual property rights could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or infringed upon. Litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management's attention away from other aspects of our business. In addition, our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property. There is a risk that we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from 25 Table of Contents improper use or dissemination and, as a result, could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation. We also hold licenses from third parties which may be utilized in our business operations. If we are no longer able to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected. Our continued success requires us to hire and retain qualified personnel. The success of our business is dependent upon being able to attract and retain personnel, including engineers, project management and craft employees around the globe, who have the necessary and required experience and expertise, and who will perform these services at a reasonable and competitive rate. Competition for these and other experienced personnel is intense. It may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. Also, it may be difficult to replace personnel who hold government granted eligibility that may be required to obtain certain government projects and/or who have significant government contract experience. As some of our executives and other key personnel approach retirement age, we need to provide for smooth transitions, which may require that we devote time and resources to indentify and integrate new personnel into these leadership roles and other key positions. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, our ability to pursue projects may be adversely affected, the costs of executing our existing and future projects may increase and our financial performance may decline. In addition, the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. For example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. Our employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous and in locations where there are high security risks, and a failure to maintain a safe work site could result in significant losses. We often work on large-scale and complex projects, frequently in geographically remote or high risk locations that are subject to political, social or economic risks, or war or civil unrest. In those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. In addition, our project sites can place our employees and others near large equipment, dangerous processes or substances or highly regulated materials, and in challenging environments. Safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation and performance. Often, we are responsible for safety on the project sites where we work. Many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts, and some of our contract fees or profits are subject to satisfying safety criteria. Unsafe work conditions also have the potential of increasing employee turnover, increasing project costs and raising our operating costs. If we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures and/or if our procedures fail, our employees or others may suffer injuries or even loss of life, the completion of a project could be delayed and we could experience investigations or litigation. Although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to implement effective health, safety and environmental procedures throughout our company, the failure to comply with such procedures, client contracts or applicable regulations could subject us to losses and liability. And, despite these activities, in these locations and at these sites, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel, nor damage to or loss of work, equipment or supplies. 26 Table of Contents We may need to raise additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which would impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives. Our ongoing ability to generate cash is important for the funding of our continuing operations, making acquisitions, investing in joint ventures and the servicing of our indebtedness. To the extent that existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities, are insufficient to make investments or acquisitions or provide needed working capital, we may require additional financing from other sources. Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing capital market conditions, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results; and those factors may affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us. Furthermore, if global economic, political or other market conditions adversely affect the financial institutions which provide credit to us, it is possible that our ability to draw upon our credit facilities may be impacted. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges. We may be unable to win new contract awards if we cannot provide clients with letters of credit, bonds or other security or credit enhancements. In certain of our business lines it is industry practice for customers to require surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other forms of credit enhancement. Surety bonds, letters of credit or guarantees indemnify our clients if we fail to perform our obligations under our contracts. Historically, we have had strong surety bonding capacity due to our industry leading credit rating, but, bonding is provided at the surety's sole discretion. In addition, because of the overall limitations in worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sufficient surety bonding capacity to meet our total surety bonding needs. With regard to letters of credit, while we have had adequate capacity under our existing credit facilities, any capacity that may be required in excess of our credit limits would be at our lenders' sole discretion and therefore is not certain. Failure to provide credit enhancements on terms required by a client may result in an inability to compete for or win a project. Any acquisitions, dispositions or other investments may present risks or uncertainties. We have made and expect to continue to pursue selective acquisitions or dispositions of businesses, or investments in strategic business opportunities. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to locate suitable acquisitions or investments, or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us, or that such transactions will be successful. Acquisitions may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted or jurisdictions where we have had little to no prior operations experience and thus expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have traditionally experienced. We also may encounter difficulties identifying all significant risks during our due diligence activities or integrating acquisitions and successfully managing the growth we expect to experience from these acquisitions. We may not be able to successfully cause a buyer of a divested business to assume the liabilities of that business or, even if such liabilities are assumed, we may have difficulties enforcing our rights, contractual or otherwise, against the buyer. We may invest in companies or businesses that fail, causing a loss of all or part of our investment. In addition, if we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for a company in which we have invested, we may have to write down that investment to its fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment loss. For cases in which we are required under the equity method or the proportionate consolidation method of accounting to recognize a proportionate share of another company's income or loss, such income or loss may impact our earnings. 27 Table of Contents Although we expect to realize certain benefits as a result of our acquisitions, there is a possibility that we may be unable to successfully integrate our businesses in order to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or do so within the intended timeframe. As a result of recent acquisitions or acquisitions that are in progress, or those that may occur in the future, we have been and will continue to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of companies we acquire. Difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include:  A delay in the integration of management teams, strategies, operations, products and services;  Diversion of the attention of management as a result of the acquisition;  The consequences of a change in tax treatment, including the costs of integration and compliance, and the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will not be realized;  Differences in corporate culture and management philosophies;  The ability to retain key personnel;  The challenges of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets into ours in a way that minimizes any adverse effects on the business; and  Potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the acquisition, including the costs to integrate beyond current estimates. Any of these factors could affect each company's ability to maintain business relationships or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. Our actual results could differ from the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements. In preparing our financial statements, we are required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:  recognition of contract revenue, costs, profits or losses in applying the principles of percentage-of-completion accounting;  recognition of revenues related to project incentives or awards we expect to receive;  recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims;  estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs;  collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts;  asset valuations;  income tax provisions and related valuation allowances;  determination of expense and potential liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs; and  accruals for other estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance revenues/reserves. Our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and reported results of operations. 28 Table of Contents It can be very difficult or expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations. As part of business operations we maintain insurance both as a corporate risk management strategy and to satisfy the requirements of many of our contracts. Although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles. We also monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance, and this is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance. Our insurance is purchased from a number of the world's leading providers, often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements. If any of our third party insurers fail, abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us, then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted. We may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change. Growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. Legislation, international protocols or treaties, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could affect our clients, including those who (a) are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels such as our Oil & Gas segment clients, (b) emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels, including some of our Power segment clients or (c) emit greenhouse gases through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. Such legislation or restrictions could increase the costs of projects for us and our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. However, legislation and regulation regarding climate change could also increase the pace of development of carbon capture and storage projects, alternative transportation, alternative energy facilities, such as wind farms, or incentivize increased implementation of clean fuel projects which could positively impact the demand for our services. We cannot predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposals may become law or what their effect will be on us and our customers. In the event we make acquisitions using our stock as consideration, stockholders' ownership percentage would be diluted. We intend to grow our business not only organically but also potentially through acquisitions. One method of paying for acquisitions or to otherwise fund our corporate initiatives is through the issuance of additional equity securities. If we do issue additional equity securities, the issuance would have the effect of diluting our earnings per share and stockholders' percentage ownership. Delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control. Fluor is a Delaware corporation. Various anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law impose impediments on the ability of others to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, certain provisions of our charters and bylaws may impede or discourage a takeover. For example:  stockholders may not act by written consent;  there are various restrictions on the ability of a stockholder to call a special meeting or to nominate a director for election; and  our Board of Directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares. These types of provisions in our charters and bylaws could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders. Accordingly, stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares. 29 Table of Contents Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
