D. Risk Factors  Risks related to the regulation of our business and to our structure  Our foreign ADS holders may be subject to PRC withholding tax on dividends payable by us and on gains realized on the sale of our ADSs, if we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise. Critical Accounting Policies Our assets and liabilities, results of operations and cashflows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. Revenue recognition Advertising sales revenues include revenues from the provision of advertisements in newspapers, magazines and billboards and are recognized when advertisements are published net of provisions for estimated rate adjustments and discounts. Payments received in advance are deferred until earned and such amounts are reported as deferred revenues included in accrued expenses and other payables of the consolidated balance sheets. Publishing services revenues include management and information consulting fees relating to magazine subscriptions and sales of magazines, such as Money Journal and Chinese Venture. Magazine subscription revenues are recognized over the subscription period. Single copy sales of magazines through distributors or retail outlets such as newsstands, supermarkets, and convenience stores are recognized when sold to the ultimate customers. Revenues from book sales are recognized when books are sold to end customers. To date, revenue from book sales has not been significant. We do not carry book and magazine inventories on our consolidated balance sheets. Costs of books and magazines published are charged to cost of revenues when incurred. Advertising services revenues include revenues from event organization, sponsorship at events, advertising agency services, mobile value-added services, provision of market research services and provision of advisory and consulting services and are generally recognized as services are provided. Revenues from event organization, such as dramas, include ticketing revenue recognized upon the delivery of tickets and admission to the events. Revenues from sponsorship at events are generally recorded over the period of the applicable agreements commencing from the operating of the related event. Revenues from advertising agency services, provision of market research services and provision of advisory and consulting services are recognized when the services are provided. Content production revenues include revenues from producing television programs, animations, visual effects and post-production for television commercials and broadcast design. Episodic television series are produced or acquired for distribution to the television market. Revenues are recognized when the master tape of the program is available for first airing under the terms of the related licensing agreement. Broadcast design mainly includes design of television channel logos, production of trailers for advertising the television channels, and image consulting and branding for the television channels. Revenue for the production of logos and trailers are recognized upon delivery of the products and customer acceptance. Revenues for image and branding consultations are recognized as the services are provided. We record revenues net of applicable business taxes, which totaled $1.9 million, $4.4 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. In the normal course of business, we act as an intermediary or agent in placing advertising transactions with television and radio stations with third parties. Such transactions are recorded at either gross or net basis depending on whether we act as the principal or as an agent in the transaction. We are considered the principal and record revenues on a gross basis in transactions where we purchase blocks of advertising time and attempt to sell the time 75 Table of Contents to advertisers, and when these transactions carry the substantial risks and rewards of ownership. We are considered an agent and record revenues on a net basis for those transactions in which we find advertising space for advertisers, and when these transactions do not carry the substantial risks and rewards of ownership We extend credit based upon an evaluation of a customers financial condition. We do not require collateral from customers to which we extend credit. Allowances for estimated credit losses are generally established based on historical experience. Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets We are required to review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. Should the carrying value of our goodwill or acquired intangible assets be determined to be impaired, their carrying value would be written down. To assess potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, we perform an assessment of the carrying value of our reporting units on at least an annual basis or when events and changes in circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would perform the second step in our assessment process and record an impairment loss to earnings to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units through internal analysis and external valuations, which utilize income and market valuation approaches through the application of capitalized earnings and discounted cashflow. These valuation techniques are based on a number of estimates and assumptions, including the projected future operating results of the reporting unit, appropriate discount rates and long-term growth rates. There were no impairment losses in the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007. Driven mainly by our repositioning in the sports and entertainment fields and the global economic downturn, we recorded an impairment charge of $180.8 million, $25.6 million and $26.2 million for goodwill, intangible assets and other assets for the year ended December 31, 2008, respectively. Due to the disposal of Convey, we recorded a loss on disposal of our subsidiaries of $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Impairment of other assets The impairment of other assets mainly consisted of (i) allowance for doubtful debts of $10.4 million as the amounts are not expected to be recovered, (ii) impairment of content production cost of $3.1 million which was the result of our determination to terminate the re-runs of related television programs in the future, and (iii) impairment of a promissory note issued by Sino Investment with accrued interest of in the aggregate of $8.5 million due to Sino Investments default with respect to interest payments on the promissory note. Due to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, our management is of the view that our principal protected note cannot be recovered, and we recorded an impairment loss on a principal protected note of $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. We recorded an impairment loss of $0.5 million on our investment in Hyperlink E-data International Ltd. (Hyperlink E-data), which was the result of the cost of our investment in Hyperlink E-data exceeding its fair value, calculated based upon an estimation of Hyperlink E-datas future cashflow. We recorded an impairment loss of $0.8 million on investment in Convey which was the result of the cost of our investment in Convey exceeding its fair value. Income taxes We recognize deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, net operating loss carry forwards and credits by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in our opinion, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 76 Table of Contents Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. Income taxes generated from our Hong Kong operations have not been material as we have not had significant operations in Hong Kong to date. For our operations based in the PRC in 2007, we were taxed at a statutory rate of 33% (30% state income tax plus 3% local income tax) applied to PRC taxable income reported in our PRC statutory financial statements. For our operations based in the PRC in 2008, we were taxed principally at a uniform income tax rate of 25%, which was applied to PRC taxable income reported in our PRC statutory financial statements. We consider our company to be permanently reinvested with respect to our investment in our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly no deferred income tax liability related to foreign subsidiaries unremitted earnings have been included in our provision for income taxes. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to income taxes and withholding taxes payable in various non-Cayman jurisdictions, which could potentially be offset by foreign tax credits. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation. A deferred tax liability should be recorded for taxable temporary differences attributable to the excess of financial reporting amounts over tax basis amounts, including those differences attributable to a more than 50% interest in a domestic subsidiary in China. However, recognition is not required in situations where the tax law provides a means by which the reported amount of that investment can be recovered tax-free and the enterprise expects that it will ultimately use such means. We have not recorded any deferred tax liability attributable to the undistributed earnings of our financial interest in VIE affiliates in China because we believe such excess earnings can be distributed in a manner that would not be subject to tax. Valuation of share-based compensation We account for share-based compensation to our employees based on SFAS No. 123R and will record compensation expense based on the fair value of the options, shares and warrants on the date of grant. We incurred share-based compensation expenses of $2.4 million, $3.1 million and $12.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. With respect to the non-vested shares granted in June 2006, we retained an independent appraiser to produce a valuation report on the fair value of our company. Significant management judgment is involved in determining the underlying variables. We concluded that $0.60 was the fair value based on managements evaluation of the report. In the third quarter of 2006, we granted share options to our employees. In addition, we issued warrants to purchase common shares to a consultant in December 2006. We used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the amount of employee share-based compensation expense for these share options and warrants. In January 2007, we issued warrants to purchase common shares to an employee. In April and September 2007, we granted share options to three and four independent directors, respectively. We used the Binomial option-pricing model to determine the amount of employee share-based compensation expense for these share options and warrants. In April 2008, we granted share options to a consultant and two independent directors. In June 2008, we granted share options to six independent directors. We used the Binomial option-pricing model to determine the amount of employee share-based compensation expense for these share options. The Black-Scholes and Binomial approaches require us to make assumptions on such variables as share price volatility, expected lives of options and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions could significantly affect the amount of employee share-based compensation expense we recognize in our consolidated financial statements. See  Operating costs and expenses  Share-based compensation expenses. Results of Operations The following table sets forth a summary of the consolidated statements of operations of our company for the periods indicated. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements of our company, including the related notes, that appear elsewhere in this annual report. Our limited operating history 77 Table of Contents makes it difficult to predict our future operating results. Therefore, our historical consolidated results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our results of operations you may expect for any future period.

Our advertising services revenue increased by $21.2 million between 2007 and 2008 primarily due to an increase in the number of mobile users in China, full year operation of our subsidiaries acquired in 2007, an increase in sales for our advertising platforms and the growth of our business generally. Our advertising service revenues as a percentage of total net revenues decreased primarily due to greater growth in other parts of our business.  Content production.

Our content production revenues as a percentage of total net revenues decreased primarily due to greater growth in other parts of our business and in particular due to our acquisition of entities that produce revenues from other sources.  Advertising sales. Our net revenues from advertising sales were $39.3 million and $65.4 million, and constituted 29.1% and 35.1% of our total net revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively.

Our selling and distribution expenses of $14.9 million and $22.9 million, representing 37.9% and 7.3% of our total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Our selling and distribution expenses increased by $8.0 million between 2007 and 2008 primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of $3.1 million, an increase in staff cost of $3.0 million and an increase in marketing cost of $1.7 million. Our selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of our total operating expenses decreased between 2007 and 2008 primarily due to a significant increase in other operating expenses, such as impairment charges and loss on disposal of subsidiaries.  General and administrative expenses. Our general and administrative expenses of $24.3 million and $52.1 million, or 62.1% and 16.7% of our total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Our general and administrative expenses increased by $27.7 million between 2007 and 2008 primarily due to an increase in staff cost of $6.6 million, an increase in share based compensation expenses of $9.4 million, an increase in legal and professional fees of $3.2 million and an increase of rental expense of $1.5 million. Our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our total operating expenses decreased between 2007 and 2008 primarily due to a significant increase in other operating expenses, such as impairment charges and loss on disposal of subsidiaries.  Impairment charges. We had impairment charges of $232.6 million, or 74.5% of our total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions of Xinhua Finance Advertising, Beijing Century Media, JCBN China, M-In, Singshine Communication, EconWorld Media, Small World and Accord Group. The impairment of goodwill of $180.8 million and intangible assets of $25.6 million was a result of (i) the decrease in the fair value of the reporting unit affected by the slowdown in the global economy and the repositioning of our business to sports and entertainment, (ii) allowance for doubtful debts of $10.4 million as the amounts are not expected to be recovered, (iii) impairment of content production cost of $3.1 million which was the result of our determination to terminate the re-runs of related television programs in the future, and (iv) impairment of a promissory note issued by Sino Investment with accrued interest of in the aggregate of $8.5 million due to the Sino Investments default with respect to interest payments.  Loss on disposal of subsidiaries. We had a loss on disposal of subsidiaries of $4.7 million, or 1.5% of our total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008, due to loss on disposal of our 85% equity 80 Table of Contents interest in Convey. On December 31, 2008 we entered into an agreement with Pariya Holdings Limited for the sale of Convey. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the total consideration to be paid for the asset transfer is $85.0 million and is subject to deduction of an earn-out payment, which is estimated to be approximately $10.6 million. The consideration will be paid in six interest-free installment payments from the date of disposal through the end of 2012. Should the actual net income of Convey for the 2008 earn out period be lower or higher than currently estimated, there would be a corresponding impact on the loss. The range of this potential impact ranges from a reduction of the loss by approximately $11.0 million, thus becoming a gain on disposal of the subsidiary of $7.0 million, to an additional loss of approximately $29.0 million. Other operating income. We recorded other operating income of $2.3 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Other operating income in 2007 primarily included reimbursement of initial public offering related expenses by The Bank of New York Mellon in the first quarter of 2007. The initial public offing related expenses had been recorded in the 2006 income statement as operating expenses because they were not considered to be directly related to sales of securities and instead related primarily to audit fees and fees paid to consultants during the listing period. Other operating income in 2008 was primarily due to a refund of previously paid business tax. Other income (expense), net. We had other income, net, of $1.3 million and other expenses, net, of $32.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Other income, net, in 2007 included interest expense of a convertible loan, imputed interest on long-term obligations and other liabilities net of interest income, interest income from a loan to a related party of $1.2 million, a realized gain on a currency linked note of $0.7 million and the relinquishment by minority shareholders of their equity interest in a sub-group of $0.8 million. Other expenses, net, in 2008 primarily included interest expense in connection with a bank loan and other liabilities, imputed interest on long-term obligations net of interest income of $6.3 million and an impairment charge associated with a principal protected note of $24.9 million and an impairment charge for our cost method investments of $1.3 million. The principal protected note was purchased from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., or Lehman Brothers, for $25.0 million. On the maturity date, the principal protected note could be redeemed at 100% plus a variable amount based on the performance of the FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index. Due to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, we are of the view that we cannot recover the principal protected note. Full provision of $24.9 million has been made against the value of the principal protected note. We recorded an impairment loss of $1.3 million on our cost method investment which was the result of the cost of our investments exceeding our estimated fair value of these investments. Provision for income taxes (benefit). For the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, we recorded an income tax benefit of $12.2 million and a provision for income tax benefit of $2.3 million, respectively. We had income tax benefit in 2007 mainly due to a $12.3 million reduction of deferred tax liabilities in the first quarter of 2007, which resulted from the reduction of the PRC enterprise income tax rate enacted in March 2007 and reflected the impact of the change in the rate on temporary differences once the new rate became effective in 2008. We also recorded $3.3 million for income taxes offset by a $3.2 million deferred tax credit. Our effective tax rate was 0.6% for the period. In 2008, we recorded a provision of $6.7 million for income taxes offset by a $4.4 million deferred tax credit. Our effective tax rate was −0.9% for the year. The change in provision for income taxes was mainly due to the increased profitability of our subsidiaries. Minority interest. Minority interest for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008 were of $1.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Minority interest in 2007 represented the portions of our income due to certain minority shareholders of the subsidiaries Beijing Century Media, Xinhua Finance Advertising Limited, Singshine (Holdings) Hongkong Ltd. and Small World Television Limited received and former minority shareholders of the subsidiaries of Beijing Perspective Orient Movie and Television Intermediary Co. Ltd. Minority interest in 2008 represented the portions of our income due to certain minority shareholders of the subsidiaries Beijing Century Media, Xinhua Finance Advertising Limited, Singshine (Holdings) Hongkong Ltd., Beijing Jingguan Xincheng Advertising Co., Ltd. and Small World Television Limited. Net income (loss). We had net income of $28.0 million and net loss of $274.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Income of $26.7 million was attributable to holders of common shares 81 Table of Contents in 2007 due to the increase in our net income. A loss of $276.9 million in 2008 was attributable to holders of common shares in 2008 due to the increase in our net loss. Year ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net revenues. We generated net revenues of $59.0 million and $134.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively, from the following sources:  Advertising Services. Our net revenues from advertising services were $44.9 million and $86.7 million, and constituted 76.1% and 64.3% of our total net revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Our advertising service revenues for 2006 and 2007 were derived primarily from advertising agency services for print and television for advertising, marketing services, including events organization, visual design and production, advertising services for billboards and websites and research services. Our advertising sales costs increased by $41.8 million between 2006 and 2007 primarily due to increased sales from the preceding revenue sources due to the growth of our business as well as increased revenues due to acquisitions, which includes sales of mobile value-added services.  Content production. Our net revenues from content production were $6.5 million and $7.7 million, and constituted 11.1% and 5.7% of our total net revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Our content production revenues for 2006 and 2007 represented primarily revenues from the production and distribution of drama series and other television programs, graphic design services, provision of post-production services and animation. Our content production revenues increased by $1.2 million between 2006 and 2007 mainly due to the growth of our business. Although our content production revenues increased between 2006 and 2007, our revenues from content production as a percentage of total net revenues decreased due primarily to greater growth in other parts of our business and in particular to our acquisition of entities that produce revenues from other sources.  Advertising sales. Our net revenues from advertising sales were $6.7 million and $39.3 million, and constituted 11.3% and 29.1% of our total net revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Our advertising sales revenues for 2006 primarily consisted of advertising sales generated by the Economic Observer and Money Journal, provision of content and sales of advertising in relation to radio, sales of advertising and sponsorship on our Fortune China programs and our agreement with Shanghai Camera.

Our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our total operating expenses decreased between 2006 and 2007 as we benefited from greater economies of scale. Other operating income.

Other income in 2007 represented reimbursement of initial public offering related expenses by The Bank of New York in the first quarter of 2007. The initial public offing related expenses had been 83 Table of Contents recorded in the 2006 income statement as operating expenses because they were not considered to be directly related to sales of securities and related primarily to audit fees and fees paid to consultants during the listing period. Other expense, net. We had our other expense, net, of $0.9 million and our other income, net, of $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

Our effective tax rate was 17.3% for the same period. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a provision of $12.2 million for income taxes mainly due to a $12.3 million reduction of deferred tax liabilities in the first quarter of 2007, which resulted from a reduction in the PRC enterprise income tax that became effective on January 1, 2008. The $12.3 million reduction of deferred tax liabilities was taken in the first quarter of 2007 because the reduction of the PRC enterprise income tax rate was enacted in March 2007 and this reflected the impact of the change in the rate on temporary differences revising once the new rate became effective in 2008. We also recorded $3.3 million for income taxes offset by a $3.2 million deferred tax credit. Our effective tax rate was 0.6% for the period. The change in provision for income taxes was due mainly to increased profits at subsidiaries that enjoy tax holidays and the acquisition of subsidiaries that enjoy tax holidays. Minority interest. Minority interest of $1.7 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively, representing the portions of our income certain minority shareholders of the subsidiaries of Beijing Century Media, Xinhua Finance Advertising Limited, Singshine (Holdings) Hongkong Ltd. and minority shareholders of Small World Television Limited received and former minority shareholders of the subsidiaries of Beijing Perspective Orient Movie and Television Intermediary Co.

Discussion of Segment Operations With the acquisition of various companies during the year 2006, we operated our business in five segments: Production, Broadcast, Print, Advertising and Research. During the first quarter of 2008, due to an update to our operating structure, our operating groups were reclassified into three segments, namely Broadcast, Print and Advertising. We integrated our Production Group into our Broadcast Group and our Research Group into our Advertising Group in 2008. As a result of the integrations, our subsidiaries and affiliates that were previously in the Production Group are currently in the Broadcast Group and those that were in the Research Group are currently in the Advertising Group. With the change to the composition of our reportable segments in 2008, the 2006 and 2007 comparative numbers are recast according to the 2008 composition of our groups. The change to the composition of our reportable segments did not have an impact on either our financial results or financial position in 2006 or 2007. Each of the operating groups is separately organized and provides distinct products and services to different customers. Each group prepares a stand-alone financial reporting package including information such as revenue, expense, and goodwill. 84 Table of Contents Year Ended Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2006 December 31, 2007 December 31, 2008 (In thousands) Net revenues of reportable segments: Print $ 13,589 $ 19,757 $ 16,458 Advertising 37,431 79,187 114,243 Broadcast 7,946 35,895 55,330 Total net revenues of our company 58,966 134,839 186,031 Cost of revenues and other operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization: Print 7,112 8,786 22,896 Advertising 27,257 61,045 235,003 Broadcast 4,527 16,645 106,867 XSEL Corporate 7,767 12,401 (1) 35,428 Total cost of revenues and other operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization 46,663 98,877 400,194 Depreciation and amortization: Print 795 1,831 2,105 Advertising 2,599 3,984 7,928 Broadcast 1,834 14,233 16,276 XSEL Corporate 7 138 323 Total depreciation and amortization 5,235 20,186 26,632 Other operating income (loss): Print 5,682 9,140 29 Advertising 7,575 14,158 886 Broadcast 1,585 5,017 582 XSEL Corporate (7,774 ) (12,539 ) 2 Total other operating income $ 7,068 $ 15,776 $ 1,499 (1) This amount has been offset by $2,261,788 in other operating income due to reimbursement of initial public offering expenses by the depositary bank pursuant to a deposit agreement in March 2007.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of FASB ratified EITF Issue 06-11 Accounting for the Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards (EITF 06-11). EITF 06-11 provides that tax benefits associated with dividends on share-based payment awards be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital. EITF 06-11 is effective, on a prospective basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cashflows. In 2007, the EITF of FASB issued EITF Issue 07-3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities (EITF 07-3). EITF reached a consensus that nonrefundable advance payments to acquire goods or pay for services that will be consumed or performed in a future period in conducting research and development activities on behalf of the entity should be recorded as an asset when the advance payments are made. Capitalized amounts should be recognized as expense when the related goods are delivered or services are performed, that is, when the goods without alternative future use are acquired or the service is rendered. EITF 07-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cashflows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combination (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R is relevant to all transactions or events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. SFAS 141R requires an acquirer to recognize any assets and non controlling interest acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. Liabilities related to contingent consideration are recognized and measured at fair value on the date of acquisition rather than at a later date when the amount of the consideration may be resolved beyond a reasonable doubt. This revised approach replaces SFAS 141s cost allocation process in which the cost of an acquisition was allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair value. SFAS 141R requires any acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs to be expensed as incurred as opposed to allocating such costs to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as previously required by SFAS 141. Under SFAS 141R, an acquirer recognizes liabilities for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting only if the requirements of SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, are met. SFAS 141R allows for the recognition of pre-acquisition contingencies at fair value only if these contingencies are likely to materialize. If this criterion is not met at the 91 Table of Contents acquisition date, then the acquirer accounts for the non-contractual contingency in accordance with recognition criteria set forth under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, in which case no amount should be recognized in purchase accounting. SFAS 141R is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS 141R. It is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cashflows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 defines a noncontrolling interest, sometimes called a minority interest, is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The objective of SFAS No. 160 is to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 160. It is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cashflows. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 161). This statement establishes enhanced disclosures about the entitys derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. Adoption of SFAS No. 161 will result in enhanced disclosure regarding the Companys derivatives. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 161. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets. This FSP amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of FSP FAS 142-3. It is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cashflows. In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position APB14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP No. 14-1), which clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) are not addressed by paragraph 12 of APB Opinion No. 14, Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase Warrants. Additionally, this FSP specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entitys nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. FSP No. 14-1 shall be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of FSB No. 14-1. It is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cashflows. In June 2008, the EITF of FASB issued EITF Issue 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entitys Own Stock (EITF 07-5). EITF Issue 07-5 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008. This Issues fixed-for-fixed, plus fair value inputs model is largely consistent with current interpretations of the phrase indexed to an entitys own stock. However, in certain circumstances, EITF Issue 07-5 may result in changes to those accounting conclusions and may have impact on issuers of equity-linked financial instruments (e.g., options or forward contracts) or instruments containing embedded features (e.g., embedded conversion options in a convertible instrument) that have (1) exercise or settlement contingency provisions, (2) a strike price that is subject to adjustment, or (3) a strike price that is denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of EITF Issue 07-5. It is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cashflows. In November 2008, FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Task Force in EITF Issue 08-6, Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations (EITF 08-6). Because of the significant changes to the guidance on subsidiary acquisitions and subsidiary equity transactions and the increased use of fair value measurements as a result of SFAS 141R and SFAS 160, questions have arisen regarding the application of that accounting guidance to 92 Table of Contents equity method investments. EITF Issue 08-6 provides guidance for entities that acquire or hold investments accounted for under the equity method. This issue is effective for transactions occurring in fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of EITF Issue 08-6. It is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cashflows. In November 2008, the EITF of FASB ratified EITF Issue 08-7, Accounting for Defensive Intangible Assets (EITF 08-7). EITF 08-7 requires entities that will acquire a defensive intangible asset after the effective date of SFAS 141R, to account for the acquired intangible asset as a separate unit of accounting and amortize the acquired intangible asset over the period during which the asset would diminish in value. EITF Issue 08-7 is effective for defensive intangible assets acquired in fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of EITF Issue 08-7. It is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cashflows. C. Research and Development We do not make, and do not expect to make, significant expenditures on research and development activities. D. Trend Information Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events for the period from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009 that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our net revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that caused the disclosed financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial conditions. E. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We did not enter into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as owners and shareholders equity, or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We did not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.

Under the amended and restated agreement, the services XFL will provide to us include only legal services and the service charge will be 50% of the actual cost incurred by XFLs legal department. We have a verbal space arrangement with a subsidiary of XFL pursuant to which we share costs under a lease held by the subsidiary. We paid $0.4 million and $0.3 million pursuant to this agreement in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The terms and prices of these transactions, taken as a whole, were determined on an arms-length basis and we believe we could have obtained comparable terms from independent third parties. Loan agreements and foreign currency agreement between us and XFL or its subsidiaries On March 31, 2006, we issued a promissory note in the amount of $38.2 million for the benefit of Xinhua Financial Network and a promissory note in the amount of $68.5 million for the benefit of XFL. Both notes were due on demand and the interest rates were not specified. We issued the promissory notes to borrow money from XFL and Xinhua Financial Network to pay for the costs related to our acquisition from XFL of equity interests XFL held before March 31, 2006 in Xinhua Finance Advertising, the contractual control XFL held before March 31, 2006 in Beijing Century Media Culture Co., Ltd. and advances from XFL and Xinhua Financial Network enabling us to acquire 19.0% equity interest in Upper Step Holdings Limited, or Upper Step, and Accord Group Investments Limited, or Accord Group. During the year ended December 31, 2007, XFL paid on our behalf earn-out consideration related to our acquisitions of Beijing Century Media and Xinhua Finance Advertising of $7.4 million and $25.0 million, respectively, and direct costs of $0.2 million. We repaid $50.0 million in cash to XFL in 2007 and the remaining balance of $113.5 million dollars was permanently waived. For the year ended December 31, 2008, XFL and its subsidiaries have paid on our behalf for 2007 earn-out considerations of $2.8 million, $4.5 million and $14.0 million for the acquisitions of Hyperlink, Beijing Century Media and Xinhua Finance Advertising, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance of $26.3 million, which included earn-out consideration of $5.0 million $2.3 million, $4.6 million and $14.0 million for our acquisitions of Economic Observer Advertising, Hyperlink, Beijing Century Media and Xinhua Finance Advertising, respectively, has been waived by XFL in 2008. We currently owe $1.1 million to XFL and its subsidiaries, which mainly represents corporate overhead expenses paid by XFL on behalf of our company. On February 6, 2006, Beijing Century Media entered into a loan agreement with Xinhua Financial Network (Beijing) Limited, under which Beijing Century Media borrowed RMB3.0 million ($0.4 million) for working capital. The loan did not carry interest and did not specify a due date. This loan was fully repaid in 2007. The terms of these loans were favorable to us as we are part of the Xinhua Finance Limited group. On March 5, 2009, we, Xinhua Finance Media (Shanghai) Limited, Xinhua Financial Network and Shanghai Huacai Investment Advisory Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of XFL, entered into an agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, Shanghai Huacai Investment Advisory Co. Ltd. advanced RMB 42,780,000 to Xinhua Finance Media (Shanghai) Limited, secured by our U.S. dollar deposits in the amount of $6.23 million. The agreement is to facilitate the conversion of the excess U.S. dollars we hold into RMB for working capital purpose. The terms of this agreement were determined on an arms-length basis. 105 Table of Contents Transactions involving our acquisitions See Item 5.A. Operating and financial review and prospects  Operating Results  Acquisitions. The terms and pricing of each acquisition, taken as a whole, were determined on an arms-length basis between the sellers and the buyers and we believe the terms are comparable to terms that could have been obtained from independent third parties. However, we received assistance from XFL and Xinhua Financial Network in executing these acquisitions and in certain instances the acquisition target was initially acquired by XFL and injected to us in exchange for certain consideration. We received favorable terms from XFL and Xinhua Financial Network as we are part of the Xinhua Finance Limited group. Transactions with David U. Lee, Leeding Media LLC, K-Jam Media Inc. and Kia Jam In April 2008, Xinhua Media Entertainment Limited, or Xinhua Media Entertainment, and Leeding Media, LLC, or Leeding Media, entered into a services agreement.

Mr. Lee is the sole shareholder of Leeding Media, which is a shareholder of Xinhua Media Entertainment.

Transactions with Shanghai Wai Gao Qiao (Group) Co., Ltd. Shanghai Wai Gao Qiao (Group) Co., Ltd., or Wai Gao Qiao, held 4.5% of the equity interest in us as of April 30, 2008 via its wholly-owned subsidiary, Honour Rise Services Limited. Wai Gao Qiao has significant influence over us due to its shareholding and our dependence on the strategic cooperation relationship between us and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Shanghai Camera Media Investment Co., Ltd., or Shanghai Camera, to carry out our television broadcast operations. The transactions we entered into with Wai Gao Qiao and its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Shanghai Camera, are treated as related party transactions, as set forth below. The terms and prices of these transactions, taken as a whole, were determined on an arms-length basis and we believe we could have obtained comparable terms from independent third parties. In January 2007, through an entrusted loan arrangement with the Agricultural Bank of China, our affiliated entity, Shanghai Yuan Zhi Advertising Co., Ltd., loaned RMB15.5 million ($2.3 million) to Shanghai Wai Gao Qiao Free Trade Zone Development Co., Ltd. to finance their working capital. The loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing and will mature in January 2010. The loan was fully repaid in 2008. In December 2008, through an entrusted loan arrangement with the Agricultural Bank of China, Shanghai Yuan Zhi Advertising Co., Ltd., our affiliated entity, loaned RMB15.5 million ($2.3 million) to Wai Gao Qiao to finance its working capital. The loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing and will mature in December 2011. Wai Gao Qiao has, however, verbally agreed to repay this loan on demand. Agreements regarding Shanghai Camera Media Investment Co., Ltd. See Item 4.B. Information on the Company  Business overview  Arrangements with partners and suppliers  Agreements regarding Shanghai Camera. We loaned $1.7 million to Shanghai Camera for working capital purposes in 2006 and an additional $0.3 million in 2008. The loan rolls over on a year-to-year basis and carries no interest. The maximum amount 106 Table of Contents drawable under the loan is RMB30.0 million ($4.4 million). Shanghai Camera repaid $2.0 million in other loans to us in 2007. Transactions with Sino Investment Holdings A $1.5 million loan from Sino Investment Holdings to us incurred in relation to our acquisition of the Accord Group was waived in 2007. The waived amount was recorded as a shareholders contribution and included in paid-in capital. Transactions with Patriarch Partners Patriarch Partners Media Holdings, LLC and its affiliates held 4.6% of the equity interests of XFL and 6.7% of our equity interests as of March 31, 2009. Patriarch Partners held 15,585,254 of our convertible preferred shares before our initial public offering, which automatically converted into 15,585,254 class A common shares upon the completion of our initial public offering. We accrued a premium over the redemption period of the preferred shares as a deemed dividend with a debit to our retained earnings of $2,157,301 for the period from the date of issuance of the preferred shares to July 24, 2006. Dividends declared to redeemable convertible preferred shares were $5,335,000 and $1,338,333 for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. No further dividends are payable on the preferred shares that were held by Patriarch Partners. Under our then Memorandum and Articles of Association, Patriarch Partners, as a holder of our convertible preferred shares, was entitled to vote on an as converted basis together with the holders of our common shares. Moreover, subject to certain exceptions, we had to obtain prior written consent from Patriarch Partners before, among other things, incurring certain indebtedness or liens, entering into certain transactions with shareholders or affiliates, entering into certain merger agreements or issuing any common shares. On September 19, 2006, we redeemed 819,672 convertible preferred shares, with a face value of $3.0 million, held by Patriarch Partners for a total consideration of $1.00. As the result of its shareholding in us and XFL and the influence over us conferred by our Memorandum and Articles of Association, Patriarch Partners has significant influence over us. The transactions we entered into with Patriarch Partners are treated as related party transactions, as set forth below. The terms and prices of these transactions, taken as a whole, were determined on an arms-length basis, and we believe we could have obtained comparable terms from independent third parties. Proxy agreement and amendment to our Memorandum and Articles of Association On July 24, 2006, Patriarch Partners consented to the amendment of our Memorandum and Articles of Association, including the creation of class B common shares held by XFL with ten votes per share (note these class B common shares converted to class A common shares on December 31, 2008). As consideration, XFL granted to Patriarch Partners an irrevocable proxy over our shares held by XFL. Under the proxy agreement, Patriarch had the exclusive right to vote (or consent) with respect to the shares held by XFL at any time after January 7, 2009. Prior to that, XFL exercised full voting power with respect to its shares, and agreed to vote to ensure that Fredy Bush remains our sole director until our initial public offering. Furthermore, XFL agreed not to sell, directly or indirectly, any of our shares that it held. This proxy agreement terminated upon the completion of our initial public offering. Share purchase agreement between us and Patriarch Partners Patriarch Partners entered into a share purchase agreement with us on March 16, 2006, agreeing to purchase 16,404,926 of our convertible preferred shares for $60.0 million. Patriarch Partners also agreed to purchase 5,468,309 additional convertible preferred shares for $20.0 million, but did not do so because we did not purchase additional assets for which the additional $20.0 million was to be raised. The purchase price was determined through our arms-length transaction with Patriarch Partners. In connection with our issuance and sale of convertible preferred shares in March 2006, we entered into an investor rights agreement and credit agreement with Patriarch Partners. Investor rights agreement among us, Patriarch Partners and XFL Pursuant to an Investor Rights Agreement dated as of March 16, 2006, we have granted Patriarch Partners and certain holders of our common shares customary registration rights, including demand and piggyback registration 107 Table of Contents rights and Form F-3 registration rights. A total of 15,585,254 common shares of our company are covered by registration rights, assuming all of the outstanding preferred shares are converted, there are no accrued and unpaid dividends and the conversion price is not adjusted. The number of shares covered by registration rights may increase if Patriarch Partners owns more of our shares, for instance, if it converts the loan under the credit agreement described below into common shares. In addition, the investor rights agreement grants Patriarch Partners preemptive rights with respect to any issuance of equity securities issued by us, which provision was terminated upon the completion of our initial public offering. In the event XFL decides to transfer some of its securities in us, it must give rights of co-sale to Patriarch Partners, so that Patriarch Partners may sell securities along with XFL in the sale. Credit agreement among us, Patriarch Partners, Patriarch Partners Agency Services, LLC and our direct subsidiaries, as guarantors In connection with its purchase of the 16,404,926 convertible preferred shares, Patriarch Partners and Patriarch Partners Agency Services, LLC entered into a credit agreement with us and our subsidiaries from time to time on March 16, 2006. Under the credit agreement, we borrowed $10.0 million from Patriarch Partners. The interest payable on the loan was LIBOR plus 2.75%. Patriarch Partners could convert any outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest into our class A common shares at any time, at an initial conversion ratio of $3.657438 per common share, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. Pursuant to this agreement, we also entered into pledge and security agreements pledging the shares of certain of our subsidiaries and granting security over our property, including shares and intellectual property, and over the property of certain of our subsidiaries. On September 20, 2006, the credit agreement was amended to provide for additional interest in the aggregate amount of $3.0 million, which resulted in the issuance of an additional 820,246 class A common shares upon the conversion of the loan. This amendment was executed one day after the redemption of 819,672 convertible preferred shares mentioned above. All outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest was converted automatically into class A common shares upon our initial public offering, and the credit agreement and pledge agreement terminated at that time. 2008 convertible loan facility agreement among us, Zohar CDO 2003-1, Limited and Zohar II 2005-1, Limited, together with Patriarch Partners Agency Services LLC On October 21, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement with Zohar CDO 2003-1, Limited and Zohar II 2005-1, Limited, as lenders, together with Patriarch Partners Agency Services, LLC, as agent for the lenders. Each of the lenders and the agent are affiliates of Patriarch Partners, one of our major shareholders. The facility is for a term of four years and is secured by a pledge of our television assets.

The conversion price will be increased to $1.37 per class A common share for the period from October 21, 2010 to October 20, 2011, and to $1.62 per class A common share for the period after October 21, 2012. We also granted certain registration rights, pre-emptive rights and tag-along rights to the lenders. As of the date of this annual report, we had drawn down an aggregate of $57.8 million from the loan facility. Transactions with Yucaipa Share purchase agreement between us and Yucaipa Yucaipa Global Partnership Fund L.P. and its affiliates, or Yucaipa, held 13.8% of our equity interests as of March 31, 2009. Yucaipa also holds 320,000 of our series B convertible preferred shares, which were purchased for $30.0 million pursuant to a share purchase agreement entered into on February 18, 2008. The purchase price was determined through our arms-length transaction with Yucaipa. The convertible preferred shares are a newly-created series having certain preferences, limitations and relative rights. The convertible preferred shares are convertible into class A common shares at the option of holders based on a conversion formula at any time after the first anniversary of the closing of the placement on February 28, 2008, or upon the occurrence of certain other events. The conversion rate at any time shall be determined by dividing an amount equal to the sum of (x) the stated value per share, which is $100.00 per convertible preferred share subject to adjustment in the event of any subdivision or combination of the outstanding preferred shares, plus (y) the amount 108 Table of Contents of any accrued dividends per share then remaining unpaid on each convertible preferred share being converted by the then applicable conversion price, initially equal to $3.00 per share, but subject to adjustment. Yucaipa, as a holder of our convertible preferred shares, is entitled to vote on an as converted basis together with the holders of our common shares. Moreover, the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding convertible preferred shares is required for certain matters, such as authorizing the issuance of any parity shares, while the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding convertible preferred shares and any outstanding parity shares is required for certain other matters, such as entering into certain transactions with shareholders or affiliates, or materially changing the scope of our business. The convertible preferred shares are entitled to quarterly preferred dividends at the rate of 8% per annum payable in cash or, at our option subject to certain limitations, through the issuance of additional convertible preferred shares. Upon any liquidation, the convertible preferred shares would be entitled to a liquidation preference. The holders of the convertible preferred shares have the right to require that their shares be redeemed by us upon the occurrence of certain events. Shareholders agreement among us, Yucaipa and XFL The shareholders agreement requires XFL to vote its shares in us and take certain other actions to ensure that an individual designated by Yucaipa will remain one of our directors so long as Yucaipa continues to hold at least 50% of the convertible preferred shares originally issued under the share purchase agreement. The shareholders agreement also provides Yucaipa with certain tag-along rights in connection with certain sales by Xinhua Finance Limited of common shares it holds in us. Registration rights agreement between us and Yucaipa Pursuant to a registration rights agreement dated February 28, 2008, we have granted Yucaipa piggyback registration rights. A total of 10,000,000 common shares of our company are covered by registration rights, assuming all of the outstanding convertible preferred shares are converted, there are no accrued and unpaid dividends and the conversion price is not adjusted. Transactions with Hunan Television & Broadcast Intermediary Co., Ltd. Long Qiu Yun has served as our independent director since March 2007 and as a director of our subsidiary, Beijing Perspective Orient Movie Television Intermediary Co., Ltd., or Beijing Perspective, since July 2006. Mr. Long also has served as the Board Chairman and General Manager of Hunan Television & Broadcast Intermediary Co., Ltd., or Hunan Television, since 1995. In July 2006, we acquired 51% of the equity of Beijing Perspective from Hunan Television through Beijing Century Media, an affiliated entity. Xinhua Financial Network financed the purchase price for this acquisition. In October, 2007, we acquired, through Beijing Century Media, the remaining 49% of the equity of Beijing Perspective for RMB16.0 million ($2.3 million). In connection with the acquisition of the remaining 49% equity interest in Beijing Perspective, we entered into a share subscription agreement and deed of non-competition undertaking and release with Whole Fortune Limited, or Whole Fortune, a limited liability company controlled by Hunan Television and incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Pursuant to these agreements, we issued 2,043,347 class A common shares to Whole Fortune in exchange for its entering into a non-competition agreement with us. Under the non-competition agreement, Whole Fortune promised that it and its affiliates will not compete with us or our affiliates outside of China for a term of four years. The common shares we issued to Whole Fortune were valued at $4.06 per share and had an aggregate value of $8.3 million. The terms of this non-competition agreement, including the price paid by us, when taken as a whole with the acquisition of 49% of the equity interest in Beijing Perspective by Beijing Century Media, were determined on an arms length basis, and we believe the terms are comparable to terms we could obtain from independent third parties. See Item 5.A. Operating and financial review and prospects  Operating Results  Acquisitions. Share restructuring On September 22, 2006, we issued 4,099,968 warrants and 6,478,437 class A common shares and XFL paid $9.1 million to Sino Investment Holdings Limited the 37.0% shareholder of our subsidiary Upper Step, and the 61.0% shareholder of Accord Group, another subsidiary of ours, in exchange for its shareholdings in Upper Step, and 451,107 class A common shares in exchange for its shareholdings in Accord Group.

Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information We have appended consolidated financial statements filed as part of this annual report. Legal Proceedings We are subject to a class action complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, for alleged violations of U.S. federal securities laws. The lawsuit asserts claims against us, our Chief Executive Officer Fredy Bush, our former Chief Financial Officer Shelly Singhal and other defendants for allegedly failing to disclose in our initial public offering registration statement and prospectus certain background information concerning Shelly Singhal. The alleged undisclosed information consists of lawsuits and proceedings that were brought against other entities with which Shelly Singhal was associated and that were completely unrelated to us. Our motion to dismiss, which we filed along with the other defendants, was granted on February 25, 2009. The plaintiffs have until May 4, 2009 to appeal the dismissal. In October 2007, we purchased from UBS Financial Services, Inc. a $25.0 million principal protected note issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., or Lehman Brothers, linked to the FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index, which matures in January 2009. In July 2008, we borrowed $14.0 million from UBS AG using the principal protected note as collateral. On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, and, after we refused to post additional collateral for the loan, UBS AG filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association against us seeking repayment of the loan on September 25, 2008. On October 28, 2008, we filed our defense to the demand as well as a cross claim against UBS Financial Services, Inc. for an amount in excess of $25.0 million. We have taken full provision of $24.9 million against the principal protection note as of December 31, 2008. Dividend Policy We have never declared or paid any dividends on our common shares, nor do we have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on our ADSs in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain most of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business. We have, however, paid dividends to the holder of our series A convertible preferred shares of approximately $7.5 million, $1.3 million and $0 million for the years ended December 31 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. We discontinued these dividends upon conversion of the series A convertible preferred shares. The terms of the 2008 credit agreement preclude us from paying any dividends on our common shares. 110 Table of Contents Holders of our series B convertible preferred shares are entitled to dividends at 8.0% per annum of the stated value of such series B convertible preferred shares, payable at each fiscal quarter in cash or stock at our option. We have issued an aggregate of 20,000 Series B convertible preferred shares as dividends to the holder of such shares as of the date of this annual report. As we are a holding company, we rely on dividends paid to us by our wholly-owned subsidiaries Upper Step Holdings Limited, Accord Group Investments Limited, Xinhua Finance Advertising, Profitown, East Alliance Limited and Small World Television, all of which are British Virgin Islands business companies, by our wholly-owned subsidiaries EconWorld Media, Singshine Marketing and Xinhua Finance Media (Hong Kong) Limited, all of which are Hong Kong companies, and by our indirect subsidiary Xinhua Media Entertainment in which we hold a 75% interest, a Cayman Islands company, for our cash requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, service any debt we may incur and pay our operating expenses. In the British Virgin Islands, the payment of dividends is subject to limitations. A British Virgin Islands business company that prior to January 1, 2007 existed as an international business company is permitted to declare and pay dividends only out of surplus, meaning the excess, if any, at the time of the determination, of the total assets of the company over the sum of its total liabilities, as shown in the books of account, plus its capital. In addition, such company may not declare or pay a dividend unless the directors of the company determine that immediately after the payment of the dividend the company will be able to satisfy its liabilities as they become due in the ordinary course of its business and the realizable value of the assets of the company will not be less than the sum of its total liabilities, other than deferred taxes, as shown in the books of account, and its capital. In Hong Kong, the payment of dividends is also subject to limitations. Dividends may only be distributed out of accumulated, realized profits less accumulated, realized losses. Accumulated, realized profits must not have been previously distributed or capitalized. Accumulated, realized losses do not include those previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital. In the Cayman Islands, the payment of dividends is also subject to limitations. Dividends may only be distributed out of profits, or out of a companys share premium account, subject to the company being able to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. If we are allowed to declare and pay dividends, the form, frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. Cash dividends on our ADSs, if any, will be paid in U.S. dollars. B.
