Risk FactorsRisks Related to Doing Business in the Peoples Republic of ChinaWe may be required to withhold PRC income tax on the dividends we pay you (if any), and any gain you realize on the transfer of ADSs or ordinary shares may also be subject to PRC withholding tax, gains realized on the disposition of our ordinary shares or ADSs could be subject to PRC withholding tax. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a disposition of our ordinary shares or ADSs will generally be treated as U.S.-source income or loss for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. A U.S. Holder that is eligible for the benefits of the Treaty may be able to elect to treat disposition gain that is subject to PRC taxation as foreign-source gain and claim a credit in respect of the tax. The rules governing foreign tax credits are complex, and U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the creditability of foreign taxes in their particular circumstances. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Payments of dividends and sales proceeds that are made within the United States or through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries generally are subject to information reporting, and may be subject to backup withholding, unless (i) the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient or (ii) in the case of backup withholding, the U.S. Holder provides a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against the holders U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle it to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Documents on Display We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) that are applicable to a foreign private issuer. In accordance with the Exchange Act, we file an annual report on Form 20-F with the SEC, and furnish other reports to the SEC. As a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from the rules under the Exchange Act prescribing the furnishing and content of quarterly reports and proxy statements, and our officers, directors, and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Copies of reports and other information, when filed with, or furnished to, the SEC, may be inspected without charge and copied at prescribed rates at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.

D: American Depositary Shares Fees and Charges Our ADS Holders May Have to Pay The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMorgan), the depositary of our ADS program, collects fees directly from investors (or brokers or other intermediaries acting on behalf of investors) for depositing shares or surrendering ADSs for the purpose of withdrawal. The depositary also collects fees for making distributions to investors, by deducting those fees from the amounts distributed or by selling a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. In addition, the depositary collects an annual fee for depositary services, by deducting from cash distributions, by directly billing investors, or by charging the book-entry system accounts of investors (or brokers or other intermediaries acting on behalf of investors). The depositary may generally refuse to provide services until its fees for those services are paid, and may sell securities or other property to pay any such fees. The following table summarizes the fees and charges that a holder of our ADSs may have to pay, directly or indirectly, pursuant to the Deposit Agreement, which was filed with the SEC as an exhibit to our Registration Statement on Form F-6 filed on October 8, 2004: Fee Service $5.00 per 100 ADSs (or portion thereof)  Issuance of ADSs, including issuances resulting from a distribution of shares or rights or other property  Cancellation of ADSs for the purpose of withdrawal, including if the Deposit Agreement terminates $0.02 per ADS (or portion thereof)  Any cash distribution to registered ADS holders $1.50 per ADR (or portion thereof)  Permitted transfers of ADRs pursuant to the Deposit Agreement A fee equivalent to the fee that would be payable if securities distributed to the holder had been shares and the shares had been deposited for issuance of ADSs.  Distribution of securities distributed to holders of deposited securities which are distributed by the depositary to registered ADS holders $0.02 per ADS (or portion thereof) per calendar year  Depositary services - 77 - Table of Contents Fee Service Registration or transfer fees  Transfer and registration of shares on our share register to or from the name of the depositary or its agent when the holder deposits or withdraws shares Expenses of the depositary  Cable, telex and facsimile transmissions (when expressly provided in the deposit agreement)  Converting foreign currency to U.S. dollars Taxes and other governmental charges the depositary or the custodian may have to pay on any ADS or share underlying an ADS, e.g., stock transfer taxes, stamp duty or withholding taxes  As necessary Any charges incurred by the depositary or its agents for servicing the deposited securities  As necessary Payments Made by the Depositary to Us Pursuant to the Deposit Agreement and an engagement letter between us and the depositary, as amended, the depositary has agreed to reimburse us annually for our expenses, including (i) stock exchange listing fees; (ii) investor relations expenses; and (iii) legal, financial printer, and accounting fees related to our public filings with the SEC. The amount of such reimbursements is subject to certain limits. In August 2009, we received US$65,000 from the depositary for the period from May 1, 2008 through April 30, 2009. For the period from May 1, 2009 through April 30, 2010, we are entitled to receive US$149,111 from the depositary. This amount has not been paid as of the date hereof. PART II Item 13: Defaults, Dividend Arrearages and Delinquencies. Not applicable. Item 14: Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds. Use of Proceeds The following discussion relates to the initial public offering our ADSs by us and certain selling shareholders, pursuant to a registration statement on Form F-1, which was declared effective by the SEC on October 27, 2004. We received net proceeds (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses related to the offering) of approximately US$42 million from the offering 4,602,547 ADSs, representing 9,205,094 ordinary shares. From November 2004 through March 31, 2010, we used a minor portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to fund acquisitions, and to fund a minor percentage of our operations. The substantial majority of our acquisitions and operations are funded through our operating revenues. - 78 - Table of Contents Item 15: Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2009. Based on this evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that, as of December 31, 2009, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young Hua Ming, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their attestation report thereon which appears herein. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ending December 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Controls. Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all misstatements, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the sound control procedures. Any control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within eLong have been detected. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders eLong, Inc. We have audited eLong, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). eLong, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. - 79 - Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, eLong, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2009 of eLong, Inc. and our report dated May 11, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young Hua Ming Beijing, Peoples Republic of China May 11, 2010 Item 16A: Audit Committee Financial Expert. The audit committee of our board of directors currently consists of Thomas Gurnee (who serves as chairman), Fernando Gil de Bernabé and Michael Scown. Our board of directors has determined that all of our audit committee members are independent under Nasdaqs Listing Rules and the Exchange Act. In addition, our board of directors has determined that Mr. Gurnee is an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 16A of the Instructions to Form 20-F and that Mr. Gil de Bernabé and Mr. Scown each has the requisite financial knowledge and experience to be qualified to serve as a member of our audit committee. Item 16B: Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our board of directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics applicable to every employee of our company, including our CEO and CFO, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, consistent with the requirements of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. We did not amend our code of conduct in 2009. Our code of ethics is posted on our website at http://www.eLong.net/AboutUs/code_conduct.html. - 80 - Table of Contents Item 16C: Principal Accountant Fees and Services. KPMG acted as the independent registered public accounting firm of our company for the year ended December 31, 2007. Effective October 10, 2008, we dismissed KPMG and engaged Ernst & Young Hua Ming to act as our independent registered public accounting firm. The following table sets forth the aggregate fees by category in connection with certain professional services rendered by KPMG and Ernst & Young Hua Ming for the periods indicated. 2008 2009 RMB RMB (in 000) (in 000) Audit Fees (KPMG)(1) 1,727 369 Audit Fees (Ernst & Young Hua Ming)(1) 4,989 5,622 Total 6,716 5,991 (1) Audit Fees are the aggregate fees billed by KPMG or Ernst & Young Hua Ming for the audit of our consolidated annual financial statements and procedures related to our quarterly financial statements.

We have not yet been fully billed by Ernst & Young Hua Ming for audit fees in relation to the year ended December 31, 2009. Our audit committee is responsible for the retention of our independent registered public accounting firm. In 2009 our audit committee pre-approved all audit services provided by KPMG and Ernst & Young Hua Ming. Item 16D: Exemptions from the Listing Standards for Audit Committees. Not applicable. Item 16E: Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers. During the period between January 1, 2009 and March 31, 2010, we did not purchase any of our shares. In 2008, pursuant to a publicly announced share buyback program, we repurchased 2,000,000 ADSs (equivalent to four million ordinary shares) at a total purchase price of US$15 million. Item 16F: Changes in Registrants Certifying Accountant Effective October 10, 2008, we engaged Ernst & Young Hua Ming as our independent registered public accounting firm, and effective the same date dismissed KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors approved both the engagement of Ernst & Young Hua Ming and the dismissal of KPMG. During the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2007, and the subsequent interim period through October 10, 2008, there were no (i) disagreements with KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements if not resolved to their satisfaction would have caused them to make reference in connection with their opinion to the subject matter of the disagreement, or (ii) reportable events. The audit reports of KPMG on the consolidated financial statements of eLong, Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except as follows: - 81 - Table of Contents KPMGs reports on the consolidated financial statements of eLong, Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007 contained a separate paragraph stating that As discussed in Note 2(h) and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2006, the Company changed its method of accounting for employee share-based arrangements as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-based Payment. Further, as discussed in Note 2(w) to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2007, the Company changed its presentation of business tax and surcharges as permitted by Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.06-3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That is, Gross versus Net Presentation). During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, and the subsequent interim period through October 10, 2008, neither we nor anyone on our behalf consulted with Ernst & Young Hua Ming concerning (a) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our consolidated financial statements, and Ernst & Young Hua Ming concluded that neither any written report nor any oral advice was provided to us that was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (b) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as that term is used in Item 16F (a)(1)(iv) of Form 20-F and the related instructions to Item 16F) with the former auditors or a reportable event (as defined in Item 16F (a)(1)(v) of Form 20-F). The audit reports of KPMG on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. We have provided KPMG with a copy of the disclosure in this Item 16F and requested KPMG furnish us with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether it agrees with the statements we have made in this Item 16F, and if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. A letter from KPMG is attached as Exhibit 15.3 to this annual report on Form 20-F. Item 16G: Corporate Governance. As Expedia controls our Board of Directors and has sufficient voting power to determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a shareholder vote, we generally intend to rely on the home country practice exception available to foreign private issuers under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and not present certain matters for a shareholder vote, where such shareholder vote would otherwise be required under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, including Rule 5635 which sets forth certain circumstances requiring shareholder approval. For example, our Board of Directors adopted the eLong, Inc. 2009 Share and Annual Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan) on May 13, 2009 without seeking prior shareholder approval, as permitted under our articles of association and applicable law of the Cayman Islands. We have notified Nasdaq of our decision to use this home country practice with respect to the adoption of equity incentive plans such as the 2009 Plan. PART III Item 17: Financial Statements.

See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. F-6 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) (1) ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS eLong, Inc. (the Company and with its consolidated subsidiaries and variable interest entities (VIEs), collectively the Group), is principally engaged in the provision of travel services, including hotel reservation services, airline ticketing, and to a lesser extent, internet-related advertising in the Peoples Republic of China (the PRC). The Company, through its subsidiaries, conducts its operations in the PRC through a series of agreements with various VIEs. These VIEs facilitate the Companys participation in internet content provision, short messaging, call center services, travel agency and air ticketing services, which are industries in the PRC in which foreign ownership is restricted. The Company does not have any direct equity interest in the VIEs. However, pursuant to certain agreements and arrangements with the VIEs and the shareholders of the VIEs, which include exclusive technical services agreements, equity pledge agreements, operating agreements and loan agreements, the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs as it absorbs the VIEs losses and receives the VIEs residual returns to the extent such returns are paid as dividends. As a result, the financial position and results of the VIEs have been consolidated in the Companys consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, Expedia, Inc., through ownership of Expedia Asia Pacific which owns 28,550,704 of the Companys high-vote ordinary shares, controls approximately 96% of the Companys voting power and has the ability to control substantially all of the Companys management and business operations. (2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a) Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs. All significant transactions and balances between the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs have been eliminated upon consolidation. (b) Basis of presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). (c) Use of estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management of the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual financial results could differ significantly from these estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include allowances for doubtful accounts, deferred income tax assets, provision for loyalty programs, share-based compensation, the allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions, useful lives and residual values of property and equipment and intangible assets, and the recovery of the carrying values of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets. F-7 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) (d) Foreign currencies The Groups functional and reporting currency is the Renminbi (RMB). Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are measured at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the RMB are remeasured into RMB using the applicable exchange rates quoted by the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) at the balance sheet dates. All such exchange gains and losses are included in foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of operations. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars (US$) are solely for the convenience of the reader and are calculated at the rate of US$1.00 = RMB6.8259, representing the noon buying rate in the City of New York for cable transfers of RMB, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on December 31, 2009. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into US$ at that rate on December 31, 2009, at any other rate, or at all. (e) Commitments and contingencies In the normal course of business, the Group is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of matters. Liabilities for such contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. (f) Revenue recognition The Groups revenues are principally derived from providing hotel reservation, air ticketing and other related travel services. The Group recognizes revenues when all of the following have occurred: persuasive evidence of arrangement with the customer, services have been performed, fees are fixed or determinable and collectability of the fees is reasonably assured, as prescribed by ASC 605-10 These criteria as related to the Groups revenues are considered to have been met as follows: Hotel reservation services The Group receives commissions from travel suppliers for hotel room reservations booked through the Group. Commissions from hotel reservation services rendered are recognized after hotel customers have completed their stay at the applicable hotel. The Group presents revenues from such transactions on a net basis in the consolidated statements of operations as the Group acts as an agent, does not assume any inventory risk, and has no obligations to the hotel for cancelled hotel reservations. Contracts with certain travel suppliers contain escalating commissions that are subject to achieving specific performance targets. Such escalating commissions are recognized when the performance targets have been achieved. Air ticketing services The Group receives commissions from travel suppliers for air ticketing services booked through the Group. Commissions from air ticketing services rendered are recognized upon the delivery of the ticket to the customer, net of estimated cancellations. Estimated cancellations were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009. The Group presents revenues from such transactions on a net basis in the consolidated statements of operations, as the Group acts as an agent, does not assume any inventory risk, and has no obligations for cancelled airline ticket reservations. We sometimes also receive additional discretionary commissions from certain airlines when specific performance targets are met. Such discretionary commissions are recognized on a cash basis because the Group cannot reasonably estimate such commissions in advance. F-8 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) Other travel services Prior to March 31, 2008, the Group also provided Chinese hotel inventory procurement, rating and availability negotiating service to Travelscape, LLC (Travelscape), which is controlled by Expedia, Inc. and recognized revenue when Travelscape confirmed the revenue sharing amount based on a pre-agreed commission sharing rate. Other travel services are mainly commissions from insurance companies for the sale of travel insurance. The Group recognizes revenue when the travel insurance certificate is issued to the customer, net of cancellations, which were not significant in 2008 or 2009. Non-travel services Non-travel services primarily comprise advertising services. Revenue from advertising contracts is recognized over the contractual advertisement display period. The Companys subsidiaries and VIEs are subject to business tax and surcharges on the revenues generated from services rendered in China. Business tax and surcharges are recorded on a net basis (excluded from revenues) in the consolidated statement of operations. (g) Income taxes Income taxes are provided for using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates or change in tax status is recognized in income in the period the change in tax rates or the tax law is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the amount of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Prior to the adoption of ASC 805, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the tax benefits associated with the utilization of pre-acquisition net operating losses carryforwards for which a valuation allowance was established at the date of the acquisition are recognized in the consolidated financial statements after the acquisition date as follows: (i) first to reduce to zero any goodwill related to the acquisition; (ii) second to reduce to zero other non-current intangible assets related to the acquisition; and (iii) third to reduce income tax expense. After the adoption of ASC 805, in accordance with ASC 805-10, the tax benefits associated with the utilization of pre-acquisition net operating losses carryforwards for which a valuation allowance was established at the date of the acquisition are recognized in the consolidated financial statements after the acquisition date as an adjustment to income tax expense. In accordance with ASC subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes, Overall (Pre-Codification: Financial Accounting Standard Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109), the impact of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is recognized in the financial statements if that position is not more likely than not to be sustained upon an examination based on the technical merits of the position. F-9 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) (h) Share-based compensation The Group applies ASC 718-10 in connection with its share based compensation arrangements. In accordance with ASC 718-10, all grants of stock options and performance units are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their grant date fair values. The valuation provisions of ASC 718-10 apply to new awards granted after the adoption of ASC 718-10, to awards granted to employees before the adoption of ASC 718-10 whose related requisite services had not been provided, and to awards which were subsequently modified or cancelled. The Group has applied the provisions of ASC 718-10 regarding the use of the simplified method in developing estimates of the expected lives of stock options. ASC 718-10 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the date of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. Share-based compensation cost is recorded net of estimated forfeitures such that expense was recorded only for those share-based awards that are expected to vest. Under ASC 718-10, the Group applies the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of options granted. Risk-free interest rates are based on the US Treasury yield for the terms consistent with the expected life of award at the time of grant. Expected life is based on historical exercise patterns, which the Group believes are representative of future behavior. Expected dividend yield is determined in view of the Companys historical dividend payout rate. The Group estimates expected volatility at the date of grant based on a combination of historical volatilities and volatilities of comparable companies before 2009. Beginning with fiscal year 2009, the Group estimates volatility only based on the Groups own historical volatilities because the length of time the Groups ADSs have been publicly traded is sufficient to make such an estimate. The Group recognizes compensation cost on all share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical forfeiture and adjusted to reflect consideration for foreseeable future changes in facts and circumstances, if any. Compensation cost related to 2007, 2008 and 2009 employee performance units, which are awards in the form of units that are denominated in a hypothetical equivalent number of the Companys ordinary shares, which number of units are determined based on the fair market value of the Companys ordinary shares on the date immediately preceding the grant date. At the time of grant, the Companys board of directors or the compensation committee determines if the Company will settle the performance units in cash or shares. F-10 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) Settlement terms of performance units, once established, may only be changed by approval of the Companys board of directors or the compensation committee. Except with respect to the performance units granted to each member of the board of directors who is not an employee of the Company or Expedia (or an Expedia affiliate) which are to be settled in cash or shares, performance units granted to employees during 2007 to 2009 are to be settled in ordinary shares. Those performance units granted during 2007 to the Companys directors who are not employees of the Company or Expedia (or an Expedia affiliate) are to be settled upon vesting by shares or cash that is equal to the fair market value of the vested ordinary shares on the vesting date. Performance units granted during 2008 and 2009 to the Companys directors who are not employees of the Company or Expedia (or an Expedia affiliate) are to be settled upon vesting by payment of the cash amount that is equal to the fair market value of the vested ordinary shares on the vesting date. Forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical forfeiture and adjusted to reflect consideration for foreseeable future changes in facts and circumstances, if any. Share-based compensation awards which are settled in cash upon vesting are classified as liabilities and included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Compensation cost related to liability-classified awards is determined based on the current share price at the balance sheet dates, and the proportionate amount of the requisite service that has been rendered to date. Changes in fair value of the liability-classified awards after the requisite service period has been completed and before awards are vested are immediately recognized as compensation cost in the period in which the change in fair value occurs. The Group accounts for equity instruments issued to each member of the board of directors who is not an employee of the Company or Expedia (or an Expedia affiliate) in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718-10 and ASC subtopic 505-50 (ASC 505-50), Equity: Equity-based Payments to Non-Employees (Pre-Codification: EITF Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services). All transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the date on which the counterpartys performance is completed. The Group uses the simplified method when calculating the expected life mainly because the Group does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected life due to the limited period of time the Groups shares have been publicly traded. (i) Loyalty points provision eLong members earn loyalty points based on their usage of the Groups services. The Group provides travel awards and other non-cash gifts to the members upon redemption of loyalty points that are accumulated based on the members transactions with the Group. The Group recognizes estimated costs to provide free travel and other non-cash gifts based on historical redemption rates. The liabilities for loyalty points are reduced upon the redemption or expiration of the loyalty points. The estimated costs are included in sales and marketing in the consolidated statements of operations and the estimated liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. (j) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions. The Group considers highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All cash and cash equivalents are unrestricted as to withdrawal and use. (k) Restricted cash Restricted cash represents cash that cannot be withdrawn without the permission of a third party. As of December 31, 2009, the Groups restricted cash of RMB60,000,000 consisted of time deposits in an escrow account in China required to support our air ticketing business. (l) Short-term investment Short-term investment, as of December 31, 2009, represents time deposits of more than three months, generally nine months duration held in commercial banks of RMB313,466,666 (2008: RMB615,809,729) and a held-to-maturity debt security of nil (2008: RMB20,000,000) reported at amortized cost with a maturity of less than one year. The Group assesses changes in the value of the debt security to determine whether any decline is other-than-temporary and impairment exists. This assessment is made by considering available evidence including changes in general market conditions, specific industry and individual company data, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the individual company, and the Groups intent and ability to hold the debt security. F-11 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) (m) Accounts receivable Accounts receivable is recorded at the invoiced amount and is non-interest bearing. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Groups best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Groups existing accounts receivable. The Group reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts periodically and determines the allowance based on historical write- off experience, the aging of the accounts receivable balance and customer credit worthiness. Specific accounts are reviewed individually for collectability. Accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Group does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure. (n) Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Group also capitalizes certain costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of internal-use software in accordance with ASC subtopic 350-40, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other: Internal-Use Software (Pre-Codification: Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use) and ASC subtopic 350-50, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other: Website Development Costs (Pre-Codification: EITF 00-2, Accounting for Web Site Development Costs). Costs incurred related to the planning and post-implementation phases of development are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives, taking into account any estimated residual value: Capitalized software development cost 3 years Computer equipment and purchased system software 3-5 years Furniture, fixtures and office equipment 5 years Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over 1 to 5 years which represents the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the assets. Projects in progress are stated at cost. Projects in progress refer to labor costs capitalized in connection with the software development before the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. (o) Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. The Group follows the provisions of ASC subtopic 350-20, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other: Goodwill (Pre-Codification: SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets). Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. The Group performs its annual impairment assessment for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in December of each year. The Group evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill. In determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill, the fair values of the tangible net assets and recognized and unrecognized intangible assets are deducted from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and is written down to its implied fair value. F-12 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic life. The impairment test on indefinite-lived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. (p) Impairment of long-lived assets The Group evaluates for impairment of its long-lived assets to be held and used, including equipment and software, separately identifiable intangible assets which are subject to amortization and other non-current assets, when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in managements judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment Overall (Pre-Codification: SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets). Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet as assets held for sale and reported at the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value less the costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. (q) Employee benefit plans Under PRC law, the Group participates in various defined contribution plans pursuant to which certain retirement, medical and other welfare benefits are provided to employees. The Group is required to make contributions to these plans at a stated contribution rates based on monthly compensation of qualified employees. The Group has no obligation for the payment of employee benefits associated with these plans beyond the mandatory contributions payable during the period of the employees employment with the Group. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, the Group contributed RMB17,820,361, RMB23,479,445 and RMB28,190,215, respectively to these plans. (r) Statutory reserves Under PRC law, the Companys wholly-owned subsidiaries are required to provide for certain statutory reserves, namely a general reserve, an enterprise expansion fund and a staff welfare and bonus fund. These subsidiaries are required to allocate at least 10% of their after tax profits on an individual company basis as determined under PRC GAAP to the general reserve and have the right to discontinue allocations to the general reserve if such reserve has reached 50% of registered capital on an individual company basis. Appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the Board of Directors of these subsidiaries. The Companys VIEs in the PRC are also subject to similar statutory reserve requirements. These reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to the Company in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends. As of December 31, 2009, the subsidiaries and VIEs in the PRC had appropriated RMB2,398,072 in general reserves and Nil in enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund. The appropriated general reserves have been included in accumulated deficit. (s) Net income/ (loss) per share Basic net income/ (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income/ (loss) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income/ (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income/ (loss) by the weighted average number of ordinary and dilutive ordinary equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Ordinary equivalent shares consist of the ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, stock warrants and the settlement of performance units. Ordinary equivalent shares in the diluted net income/ (loss) per share computation are excluded in net loss periods as their effect would be anti-dilutive. For the calculation of basic net income/ (loss) and diluted net income/ (loss), ordinary shares include ordinary shares and high-vote ordinary shares. F-13 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) (t) Advertising expense The Group incurs advertising expense consisting of radio, magazine, email and short messaging service (SMS) advertising, and online internet advertising expense to promote the Groups brand and services. The Group expenses the production costs associated with advertisements in the period in which the advertisement first takes place. The Group expenses the costs of communicating the advertisement as incurred each time the advertisement is shown. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, and 2009, the advertising expense was RMB18,742,438, RMB34,707,335 and RMB30,839,870 respectively, recorded as a component of sales and marketing expenses. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, the Group had RMB116,481 and RMB482,823, respectively, of prepaid marketing expenses which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. (u) Segment reporting The Group operates and manages its business as two reportable segmentsHotel and Air. In accordance with ASC subtopic 280-10, Segment Reporting: Overall (Pre-Codification: SFAS 131, Disclosures about segments of an Enterprise and Related Information), the Groups chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Group. The Group does not allocate any assets to its hotel and air segments as management does not use this information to measure the performance of the reportable segments. The Group generates substantially all revenues from customers in the PRC. Accordingly, no geographical segments are presented. (v) Operating leases The Group leases office space under operating lease agreements with original lease periods of up to four years. Rental expenses are recognized from the date of initial possession of the leased property on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain lease agreements contain rent holidays, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease renewal periods are considered on a lease-by-lease basis and are generally not included in the initial lease term. (w) Financial instruments Financial instruments of the Group are primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, short-term investments, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other payables. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, their carrying value approximated their fair value due to their short term nature. (x) Treasury stock As of December 31, 2008, the Group repurchased 2,000,000 ADSs at a cost of US$15 million including brokerage commission. In 2009, the Group did not repurchase any ADSs or ordinary shares. The ADSs repurchased by the Group are no longer outstanding. The repurchase of ADSs is accounted for under the cost method whereby the entire cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury stock. F-14 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) (y) Recently issued accounting pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R) (subsequently codified as ASC 805), Business Combination. ASC 805 establishes requirements for the recognition and measurement of acquired assets, liabilities, goodwill, and non- controlling interests (formerly minority interests). ASC 805 also provides disclosure requirements related to business combinations. ASC 805 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. ASC 805 will be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of ASC 805 had no material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 (subsequently codified as ASC 810-10-65-1, Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51. ASC 810-10-65-1 amends ARB No. 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This Statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of ASC 810-10-65-1 had no material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements. In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165 (subsequently codified as ASC 855), Subsequent Events, which sets forth general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. ASC 855 is effective after June 15, 2009. In February 2010, the FASB issued guidance ASU 2010-09, Subsequent Events: Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements, to amend ASC 855 Subsequent Events that SEC registrants will not disclose the date through which management evaluated subsequent events in the financial statements  either in originally issued financial statements or reissued financial statements. ASU 2010-09 is effective immediately for all financial statements that have not yet been issued or have not yet become available to be issued, except for guidance related to the date through which conduit bond obligors should evaluate subsequent events. The adoption of ASC 855 and ASU 2010-09 had no material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, FASB issued ASC 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (Pre-Codification: SFAS No. 168, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162). ASC 105 establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. This Statement is effective for our reporting period ended on September 30, 2009. Beginning with the third fiscal quarter of 2009, our references made to U.S. GAAP use the new Codification numbering system prescribed by the FASB. As the Codification is not intended to change or alter existing U.S. GAAP, the adoption of ASC 105 had no impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to various sections of ASC 810, Consolidation (Pre-Codification: SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)) which amends FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003)) to address the elimination of the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity. The amendments to ASC 810 also replaces the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Additionally, the amendments to ASC 810 provide more timely and useful information about an enterprises involvement with a variable interest entity. These amendments to ASC 810 shall be effective as of the beginning of each reporting entitys first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. Earlier application is prohibited. The Group is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASC 810 on the Groups consolidated financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued guidance ASU 2009-13, Revenue Recognition: Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangementsa consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force, on revenue recognition to require companies to allocate revenue in multiple-element arrangements based on an elements estimated selling price if vendor-specific or other third-party evidence of value is not available. This guidance is effective beginning January 1, 2011 with earlier application permitted. The Group is currently evaluating both the timing and the impact of the adoption of ASU 2009-13 on the Groups consolidated financial statements. F-15 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) (3) ACQUISITION AND DISCONTINUED OPERATION Acquisition In September 2009, the Group completed the acquisition of the hotel and air reservation businesses of three China on-line travel agent companies (collectively, Target Companies). The Group did not acquire any equity interests of the Target Companies. A portion of the total purchase price was paid in cash and the remaining balance recognized in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The remaining purchase price is contingent on the performance of the Target Companies air and hotel reservation businesses for a two year period after the acquisition date. As a result of this acquisition, the Group recorded RMB1,950,000 of goodwill and recognized the fair value of identifiable assets, which were not significant. The results of operations of the acquired businesses of the Target Companies were not significant and have been included in the consolidated statement of operations since the acquisition date. Online Dating Division During the third quarter of 2006, the Group sold its online dating business to Match.com. The financial results of the interactive online dating community businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and related disclosures. As a result, the footnote disclosures in the Groups consolidated financial statements were revised to exclude the amounts related to the financial results of the interactive online dating community businesses.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, the Groups capitalized software development costs, including projects in progress, net of accumulated amortization, were RMB13,803,961 and RMB16,478,550, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, and 2009, the Group recorded depreciation relating to capitalized software development costs of RMB1,785,945, RMB2,964,220 and RMB5,424,326, respectively. (6) GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS No impairment charge for goodwill was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009 as a result of the impairment tests undertaken. The following table presents the changes in goodwill: December 31, 2008 2009 Goodwill at the beginning of the year 30,000,019 30,000,019 Addition due to acquisition of business  1,950,000 Goodwill at the end of the year 30,000,019 31,950,019 During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Group recorded impairment charges of RMB493,680, which is included in charges related to property and equipment and intangible assets, in relation to the customer list of Fortune Trip. The impairment mainly resulted from a significant decline in forecasted sales and cash flows from Fortune Trip due to the inability to maintain active customers that contribute revenue to the Group. These factors resulted in the carrying value of the customer list being greater than its fair value, and therefore a write-down to fair value was required. No impairment charge for the customer lists was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Group recorded an impairment charge of RMB400,000 for the remaining value of a trade name,which is included in charges related to property and equipment and intangible assets. During the year ended December 31, 2009, no impairment charge for the trade name was recorded. F-18 Table of Contents eLong, Inc.

As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009, the amounts payable to these former shareholders were RMB22,787,587 and RMB22,231,241, respectively. The fluctuation was due to the payment of RMB535,767 (US$78,353) to Yijie Wang in 2009 and changes in the RMB:U.S. dollar exchange rate. In March 2010, after deducting certain fees and expenses, the Group settled the payables to Billable Development Ltd. and Guiying Wang, other than with respect to an amount of RMB2,166,022 (US$317,324) relating to the payable to Billable Development Ltd.

Cayman Under the current laws of Cayman Islands, the Company is not subject to tax on their income or capital gains. In addition, no Cayman Islands withholding tax is imposed upon any payments of dividends. China Prior to January 1, 2008, the Companys subsidiaries and VIEs in China were subject to Corporate Income Tax (CIT) at a rate of 33%. As described below, certain of the Companys subsidiaries and VIEs were subject to preferential rates ranging from 15% to 27%. eLongNet Information Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (eLong Information), a subsidiary of the Group, obtained the status of a High New Technology Enterprise in November 2006 and was entitled to a preferential CIT rate of 15% from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2007. Beijing eLong Information Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing Information), a VIE of the Group, obtained the status of a High New Technology Enterprise that entitled it to a preferential CIT rate of 15% from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2007. Further, certain branches of the VIEs are taxed at 27% of deemed taxable income. The taxable income is determined based on the deemed profit method with the current deemed profit rate of 10%. F-20 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) In 2007, the PRC enacted a new CIT Law and promulgated related regulations, effective from January 1, 2008, impose a unified income tax rate of 25% for both domestic and foreign invested enterprises. In addition, qualified High New Technology Enterprise shall be entitled to enjoy a preferential CIT rate of 15%. eLong Information and Beijing Information have been certified as High New Technology Enterprise under the new CIT law and enjoyed a reduced CIT rate of 15% for fiscal years 2008 and 2009. In addition, Hangzhou eLong Air Service Co., Ltd. is taxed at 25% of deemed taxable income which was determined based on the deemed profit method with the current deemed profit rate of 10% for the fiscal year 2007, 2008 and 2009. Beijing Xici-Interactive Information Technology Co. Ltd began to be taxed under the same method in the fiscal year 2009 from a prior income tax rate of 25%. Three Shenzhen branches of eLong were entitled to a transitional preferential tax rate of 20% based on Regulations on Special Economic Zones in Guangdong Province. The transitional preferential tax rate for the fiscal years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is 22%, 24% and 25%, respectively. The new CIT Law also imposes a 10% withholding income tax for dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside the PRC, which were exempted under the previous income tax laws and rules. The 10% withholding tax rate can be further reduced based on the tax arrangement/tax treaty between China and the other respective jurisdiction. The undistributed earnings generated before January 1, 2008 shall be exempted from withholding tax when such earnings are distributed to the foreign investor in the year of 2008 or thereafter. The Groups foreign subsidiaries and its VIEs are permanently reinvesting its earnings and, as such, under ASC subtopic 740-30, Income Taxes: Other Considerations or Special Areas (Pre-Codification: APB Opinion No. 23, Accounting for Income Taxes  Special Areas), the Company has not recorded deferred tax liabilities on the outside basis in its foreign subsidiaries and VIEs. It is not practicable for the Group to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. Under the new CIT Law, a company incorporated outside of the PRC, but having effective management in the PRC will be considered a PRC tax resident and will be subject to PRC CIT on its worldwide income. The Implementation Regulations of the new CIT Law further define effective management as the substantive comprehensive management and control of the production, business, personnel, finance and assets of a company. Currently, Expedia, Inc., through Expedia Asia Pacific, controls approximately 96% of the voting power of the Companys voting stock. In addition, certain other shareholders are parties to an investors agreement with Expedia Asia Pacific under which they have agreed to vote their ordinary shares in the election of directors designated by Expedia, Inc. Accordingly, Expedia, Inc. generally is able to exercise control over all matters requiring approval by our board of directors or our shareholders. Nevertheless, it is possible that the PRC tax authorities would treat eLong, Inc. as a PRC tax resident, and, if so, that the Company would be subject to PRC CIT on its worldwide income and that such determination may have retroactive effect.

According to the PRC Tax Administration and Collection Law, the statute of limitations is three years for underpayment of taxes due to computational errors made by the taxpayer or the withholding agent. The statute of limitations will be extended to five years under special circumstances, which are not clearly defined. In the case of transfer pricing issues, the statute of limitations is three years, and will be extended to ten years under special circumstances, which are not clearly defined. There is no statute of limitations in the case of tax evasion. The Groups 2005 to 2009 tax returns remain subject to examination by the PRC tax authorities. The Group did not have any unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2009, and it does not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly within the next 12 months. No interest or penalty related to unrecognized uncertain tax positions was recorded in the 2007, 2008 and 2009 consolidated financial statements. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented below. For the year ended December 31, 2008 2009 Deferred tax assets: Operating loss carryforwards 3,365,883 1,203,255 Operating loss carryforwards, pre-acquisition 1,136,556 561,457 Property and equipment 110,030 225,834 Accrued expenses and deferred revenue 2,830,607 4,374,485 Total gross deferred tax assets 7,443,076 6,365,031 Less: valuation allowance (6,824,590 ) (5,272,690 ) Net deferred tax assets 618,486 1,092,341 Deferred tax liabilities: Intangible assets with definite lives 235,842 78,615 Software capitalization  657,298 Total deferred tax liabilities 235,842 735,913 Total net deferred tax assets 382,644 356,428 Deferred tax assets, net:  Current, included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 22,924 686,069  Non-current, included in other non-current assets 359,720 327,657 Deferred tax liabilities, included in other liabilities:  657,298 The beginning of the year valuation allowance was adjusted due to a change in circumstances that has caused a reassessment in judgment of the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years. The change in the valuation allowance because of the partial net operating loss carryforward expired in 2007 was RMB598,915 for the year ended December 31, 2007 and the change in the valuation allowance because of the cumulative losses in recent years including 2008 was RMB1,034,991 for the year ended December 31, 2008, and were primarily due to certain allowances for accrued expenses and net operation loss carryforward. There was no change of the beginning of the year valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2009. The gross amount of operating loss carryforwards which will expire between 2010 and 2014 are as follows: RMB4,122,083 in 2010, RMB648,367 in 2011, RMB420,273 in 2012, RMB1,113,558 in 2013, and RMB754,565 in 2014. As of December 31, 2009, the amount of valuation allowance associated with pre-acquisition net operating losses was RMB482,842. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible or utilized. The Group considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon an assessment of the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible or can be utilized, management has provided a valuation allowance of RMB6,824,590 and RMB5,272,690 as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) (10) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments The Group has several non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for office rent. Payments under operating leases, including periodic rent escalation, are charged as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases (with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year) as of December 31, 2009 are: Minimum lease payments 2010 10,899,510 2011 10,169,345 2012 9,445,518 2013  2014  Total 30,514,373 Rental expenses incurred under operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009 amounted to RMB11,183,306, RMB11,303,649 and RMB12,038,810, respectively. Guarantee In connection with our air ticket service business, the Group is required by the Civil Aviation Administration of China and International Air Transport Association to provide guarantees for air tickets obtained from various airlines. As of December 31, 2009, the amount under these guarantee arrangements was approximately RMB110 million (RMB66 million as of December 31, 2008). Based on historical experience and information currently available, we do not believe that it is probable that we will be required to pay any amount under these guarantee arrangements. Therefore, we have not recorded any liability beyond what is required in connection with these guarantee arrangements. Contingencies The Group is not currently a party to any pending material litigation or claim. (11) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Stock options In April 2001, the Company adopted the stock option plan (the 2001 Plan) pursuant to which the Companys Board of Directors may grant stock options to selected directors, officers, key employees and consultants of the Group. The Plan authorizes the Company to grant options to purchase up to 4,000,000 ordinary shares. On August 26, 2003, the Company increased the number of ordinary shares authorized to be issued under the 2001 Stock Option Plan to 5,500,000. In July 2004, the Company adopted a stock and annual incentive plan (the 2004 Plan) that allows the Board of Directors to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or performance units to officers, employees, directors or consultants of the Group to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of ordinary shares. On December 13, 2006, the Company amended the 2004 Plan to allow grant of performance units to non-employees under the 2004 Plan. In May 2009, the Company adopted a stock and annual incentive plan (the 2009 Plan) that allows the Board of Directors to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or performance units to officers, employees, directors or consultants of the Group to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of ordinary shares. On December 30, 2009, the 2009 Plan was amended to allow equity grants to members of the Companys board of directors. The options under both the 2001 Plan and 2004 Plan have a contractual life of ten years and generally vest and become exercisable ratably over three to five years from the date of grant, except the options granted in 2001 which do not require future services nor contain a performance or market condition and are expensed on the grant date. The options under the 2009 Plan have a contractual life of five years and generally vest and become exercisable over three years from the date of grant, with 30% vesting on each of the first and second anniversaries of the grant date, and the remaining 40% vesting on the third anniversary of the grant date.

The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009 was US$0.6 million, US$0.1 million and US$0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, there was RMB29,980,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of 2.8 years. Total unrecognized compensation cost may be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. Expedia Options On August 4, 2004, in connection with the sale of the Series B preferred shares, the Company issued to Expedia Asia Pacific an option to purchase 711,429 ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$5.25 per share. The option mirrors the terms and conditions of the 1.66 million options granted to certain of the Companys employees and officers on July 23, 2004 under the 2004 Plan. The option becomes exercisable by Expedia Asia Pacific each time any such officer or employee exercises any of such 1.66 million options. In connection with each exercise by an employee or officer, Expedia Asia Pacific is entitled to exercise a portion of its option such that Expedia Asia Pacific would receive (if Expedia Asia Pacific exercises to the fullest extent in connection with such employee or officer exercise) 30% of the aggregate ordinary shares issued to such employee or officer and Expedia Asia Pacific in connection with such employee or officer exercise. To the extent that any such officers or employees options terminate or expire without being exercised, an amount of Expedia Asia Pacifics option equal to 30% of (i) such officers or employees terminated or expired options divided by (ii) 0.70, will likewise terminate or expire. As of December 31, 2009, 559,179 options granted to Expedia Asia Pacific on August 4, 2004 had been forfeited as a result of the forfeiture or expiration of the options of the relevant eLong employees. As of December 31, 2009, Expedia Asia Pacific held an option to purchase up to 152,250 ordinary shares. In addition, on October 1, 2004, the Company entered into a stock option agreement with Expedia Asia Pacific pursuant to which, in exchange for Expedia Asia Pacific giving its consent to the issuance of 250,000 options to certain of the Companys officers, the Company granted Expedia Asia Pacific an option to purchase up to 260,204 of the Companys ordinary shares at a purchase price of US$5.25 per share. The option mirrors the provision of 250,000 options granted to the Companys officers on October 1, 2004. As of December 31, 2008, all of these options have been forfeited.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) Performance Units Performance units are rights to receive the Companys ordinary shares, or in some cases, a cash award linked to the Companys ordinary share value. Most performance units vest ratably over a five-year period, are not entitled to dividends or voting rights, and are generally converted to ordinary shares upon vesting on a one-for-one basis. When the performance unit grants are settled in cash, the cash amount is set at the equivalent of the fair market value of the number of the Companys ordinary shares that the grantee would have received on a particular vesting date, had the grant been settled in shares. The cost of the performance unit awards was determined using the fair value (based on the fair value of the underlying ordinary shares on the date immediately preceding the grant date) of the Companys ordinary shares on the date of grant, net of expected forfeitures. Compensation cost for the performance units issued in shares is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term. The balance for the cash settled performance units of RMB(157,436) has been included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and is revalued every reporting period with changes in fair value recorded as share-based compensation cost.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) Warrants In August 2003, the Company issued warrants to purchase 600,000 of the Companys ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$0.75 per share to Broadband Capital Management LLC (Broadband), and two outside consultants, in consideration for investment banking services provided to the Company in respect of the private placement of US$15 million aggregate principal amount of Series A preferred shares in August 2003. The Company accounted for the warrants issued to Broadband and the two consultants in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and ASC 505-50. The fair value of the warrants granted was RMB4,818,960 on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model (excluding a volatility assumption as the Company was a non-public entity at the date the warrants were issued). The assumptions used in determining the fair value of the warrants included an expected dividend yield of 0%, a risk free interest rate of 2.9%, and an expected life of 10 years. The estimated fair value of the warrants of RMB4,818,960 was charged against the gross proceeds of the Series A preferred shares as such costs were incremental and specifically and directly attributable to the actual placement of such securities. During the year ended December 31, 2008, no warrant was exercised into ordinary shares. During the year ended December 31, 2009, 15,000 warrants were exercised into 11,918 ordinary shares after netting off shares equal to the exercise price due. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, the number of warrants outstanding and exercisable was 15,121 and 121, respectively. (12) ORDINARY SHARES Ordinary Shares During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, the Company issued 209,872, 195,018 and 303,988 ordinary shares to certain of its stock option and performance units holders for an aggregate exercise price of US$410,583 (RMB3,149,851), US$77,747 (RMB556,943) and US$176,505 (RMB1,206,270), respectively. Since 2006, to facilitate the employee stock option exercise process, the Company issued depositary shares to its brokers. These shares are not considered outstanding until issued to the employees as a result of the exercise of stock options. As of December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, 755,170, 560,152 and 268,082 depositary shares were issued to brokers and not to the shareholders. High-Vote Ordinary Shares Expedia Asia Pacific beneficially holds 28,550,704 high-vote ordinary shares, which constitute all of the Companys outstanding high-vote ordinary shares and, as a result, controls approximately 96% of the voting power of all shares of the Companys voting stock as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. In addition, certain other shareholders are parties to an investor agreement with Expedia Asia Pacific under which they have agreed to vote their ordinary shares in the election of directors designated by Expedia Asia Pacific. Expedia Asia Pacific has the ability to control the composition of the Companys Board of Directors, including the ability to nominate new or replacement directors and vote their shares to elect them and the right to vote their shares to remove members of the Board of Directors. The rights of the ordinary shares and high-vote ordinary shares are the same except that each high-vote ordinary share is entitled to 15 votes, whereas each ordinary share is entitled to one vote. Treasury stock During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, the Company repurchased 2,000,000 ADSs and nil at a cost of USD$15.0 million (RMB103.4 million) and nil, respectively.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) (13) EARNINGS (LOSS) PER ORDINARY SHARE Potentially dilutive securities that could potentially dilute basic earnings per ordinary share include stock options and performance units granted to employees, directors and non-employees and stock warrants granted to non-employees. In 2007 and 2008, potentially dilutive stock options, performance units and warrants in the diluted loss per ordinary share computation are excluded as their effect would be anti-dilutive.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, substantially all of the Groups cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments were held in major financial institutions located in the PRC, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the United States, which management believes are of generally high credit quality. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and denominated in RMB, and are derived from revenues earned from operations arising in the PRC. The Group performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. The Group maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts and actual losses have been within managements expectations. The Group has a diversified base of customers. No individual customer contributed to more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2008 and 2009. Except for our reliance on the Travelsky GDS system for our air business, the Group does not have concentrations of available sources of labors, services, franchises, licenses or other rights that could, if suddenly eliminated, severely impact its operations. Business and economic risks The Groups business is subject to certain risks and concentrations including risks relating to the condition of the economy, outbreak of disease or the occurrence of natural or man-made disaster, dependence on relationships with travel suppliers, primarily airlines and hotels, dependence on third-party technology providers, exposure to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud. The Group conducts substantially all of its operations in the PRC and accordingly is subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with investments in equity securities of United States and Western European companies. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic, legal environment and social uncertainties in the PRC, influence of the China National Tourism Administration over certain aspects of the Groups operations and competition in the travel agency industry. The Chinese government regulates internet access, the distribution of online news and other information, the provision of online commerce and provision of travel agency services through strict business licensing requirements and other governmental regulations. These regulations include limiting foreign ownership in Chinese companies providing internet access, information and other online internet services and travel agency services. Management, after consultation and advice from PRC legal counsel, is of the opinion that the Groups business complies with existing Chinese laws and regulations. However, the interpretation and application of current or proposed requirements and regulations may have an adverse effect on the Groups business, financial condition and result of operations. F-29 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) Foreign exchange risk The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions in China and the United States. The conversion of RMB into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is based on rates set by the Peoples Bank of China. Currently, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. In the future, the PRC government may adopt a more flexible currency policy, which could result in increased exchange rate volatility and a significant appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. Substantially all of our revenue-generating operations are transacted in Renminbi, and we have a significant portion of our financial assets denominated in U.S. dollars. If the Renminbi appreciates we will record foreign exchange losses on United States dollar-denominated assets and these losses could be material to our results of operations. In addition, any changes in the value of the Renminbi may materially and adversely affect the value in foreign currency terms of our ADSs and any dividends payable by us. (15) SEGMENT INFORMATION The Group operates Hotel and Air segments. All of the Groups long-lived assets are located in the PRC. These reportable segments are business units that offer different services that are managed separately because each requires different service provision and marketing strategies. The Hotel segment mainly provides the services to customers for the reservation with hotels and the Air segment provides the services to customers for the air tickets booking with airline companies. Others segment provides internet-related advertising services and other travel services. The Group determined its segments based on how the Groups chief operating decision maker manages the Groups business, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance. The key performance index for measuring segment results by the Groups chief operating decision maker is Total Contribution.
