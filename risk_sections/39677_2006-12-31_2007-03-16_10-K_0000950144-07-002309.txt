Item 1A. Risk Factors Â— continued Parkway by October 31, 2008, barring delays for some period of time resulting from causes beyond our reasonable control. We have experienced some delays in obtaining necessary rights-of-way, permits and approvals for the parkway, and therefore its completion may be delayed beyond October 31, 2008. The incurrence of substantial compliance costs, denial or postponement of necessary development permits or the imposition of delays and other regulatory burdens could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Furthermore, various federal, state and local laws subject property owners or operators to liability for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on a property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the release of the hazardous substances. The presence of such hazardous substances at one or more properties, and the requirement to remove or remediate such substances, could result in significant cost. Certain events could trigger the acceleration of payment of the 4.50% Notes Certain events, including cessation of trading of our common stock, failure to pay interest when due on our 4.50% Notes, final judgment(s) for the payment of money in excess of $20,000 rendered against us or any of our subsidiaries if not discharged for any periods of 30 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement is not in effect, could result in a default under our 4.50% Notes. Such default would result in the requirement for payment of the 4.50% Notes prior to the due date thereof. Our inability to make such accelerated payment could have a material adverse effect upon our business. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. 11 Table of Contents
