D. Risk Factors Our business faces significant risks. You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this annual report and in our other filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the following risk factors which we face and which are faced by our industry. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our results could materially differ from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, as a result of certain factors including the risks described below and elsewhere in this report and our other SEC filings. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Industry Data on page ii. Risks related to our Business and Industry A key element of our strategy is to expand in target markets, such as the United States, which will require substantial investment to build product and brand awareness and develop an installed base of users, and our failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our future growth and prospects. A key element of our strategy is to grow our business by expanding sales of our soda makers, CO2 refills and other related consumables in certain existing markets that we believe have high growth potential in which we currently have a limited presence and in select new markets. In particular, we are focusing our growth efforts on the United States, the worlds largest market for carbonated beverages and our most important target market. Our success depends, in large part, upon consumer acceptance and adoption of our products. Consumer tastes and preferences differ in the markets into which we are expanding as compared to those in which we already sell a significant amount of products. We will face several challenges in achieving consumer acceptance and adoption of our home beverage carbonation systems in those markets, including consumers desire to carbonate beverages at home rather than purchasing carbonated beverages and consumers willingness to exchange empty CO2 cylinders for filled CO2 cylinders. The United States differs from most European markets because of the higher propensity in the United States to consume carbonated beverages rather than sparkling water. This is requiring us to market our products differently than we have in our key European markets. There can be no assurance that we will meet any of these challenges in the existing or new markets we are targeting and the failure to do so would adversely affect our growth in a particular market and may adversely affect our strategy, future growth and prospects. We may not be successful in continuing to develop or maintaining our presence in retail networks for the sale of our home beverage carbonation systems and the exchange of our empty CO2 cylinders in the markets we are targeting for growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and prospects. Our growth both in existing markets and in new markets depends significantly on our ability to develop or maintain our presence in retail networks, as retailers are the primary channel through which consumers initially purchase our home beverage carbonation system and the primary channel through which our consumables are sold. Our ability to successfully expand in the markets that we are targeting for growth depends, in large part, on whether we are able to establish relationships with strong retailers in those markets for the sale of our home beverage carbonation systems and the exchange of our empty CO2 cylinders. Establishing relationships with retailers may prove more difficult in the United States, our key market for growth, than in our other markets, as retailers in the United States may be more likely to be resistant to establishing the reverse logistics needed for consumers to return empty CO2 cylinders and exchange them for filled ones. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in establishing relationships with large retailers in the markets we are targeting for growth, particularly the United States, or that if successful, we will do so in a time frame consistent with our projections or that will enable us to achieve significant sales. Our failure to establish and maintain such relationships will adversely affect our ability to grow in a particular market and may adversely affect our future growth and prospects. 6 TABLE OF CONTENTS Our ability to grow our business successfully depends on whether we can develop and implement production and operating infrastructure, including increased manufacturing capacity, to effectively support our growth. We are targeting certain markets for growth in which we historically had limited or no presence, including the United States, and other markets in which we have not had a presence in the recent past, including the United Kingdom. Achieving and successfully managing growth in these markets will require that we develop and implement production and operating infrastructure including, among other things, infrastructure for product development and for manufacturing our products, information technology and financial control systems. In addition, we will need to continue to develop the infrastructure for consumers to conveniently exchange empty CO 2 cylinders for filled ones, whether through retail outlets or otherwise. The development and implementation of this infrastructure will require significant additional investment as our business grows and becomes increasingly complex in these markets. Our future results will depend on managements ability to successfully implement these initiatives on a larger scale, particularly in the United States. Failure to do so could negatively impact our efforts to increase our sales in these markets and have a material adverse effect on our future growth and prospects. Our future success also requires that we have adequate capacity in our manufacturing facilities to manufacture sufficient products to support our current level of sales and the anticipated increased levels that may result from our growth plans. We believe that the capacity of our current manufacturing facilities and subcontractors is sufficient to meet anticipated demand for our products through 2013. We currently anticipate needing additional manufacturing capacity in the future as the demand for our products continues to increase. We intend to meet this future need for additional manufacturing capacity by constructing and/or purchasing an additional manufacturing facility in or near one of our existing markets. Pending the construction or purchase of such an additional manufacturing facility, we are investing in expanding our manufacturing capabilities through other means, primarily by expanding the manufacturing capacity at our existing facilities and by increasing the use of sub-contractors for certain products and components. We currently intend to construct an additional facility in the southern part of Israel for which we will need to secure additional real estate and hire additional employees. Construction of a new manufacturing facility involves risks, including the risk of cost overruns and unexpected delays. Appropriate locations, as well as a sufficient pool of employees, may not be available at reasonable costs or at all. If we choose to purchase an existing manufacturing facility and modify it for our manufacturing needs, we may incur similar cost overruns and unexpected delays. In addition, our actual cost to construct or purchase such a facility might be higher than the projected cost. Any interruption of operations at our existing manufacturing facilities or our failure to secure additional manufacturing capacity when necessary in the future could result in an interruption in the supply of our products to our customers, thereby impeding our growth plans. Our marketing campaigns and media spending might not result in increased sales or generate the levels of product and brand name awareness we desire. Our products are ultimately sold to consumers and, therefore, our future growth depends in large part on our ability to create awareness of our product and our brand name. To create and maintain this awareness, we intend to engage in extensive advertising and promotional campaigns in certain key markets that we believe have significant growth potential. Our future growth and profitability will depend in part on the effectiveness and efficiency of these campaigns and our media spending, including our ability to:  raise awareness of our home beverage carbonation system and brand name;  determine the appropriate creative message and media mix for future expenditures; 7 TABLE OF CONTENTS  create and tailor specific advertisements and promotion campaigns for each country in which we distribute; and  effectively manage advertising costs, including creative and media costs, to maintain acceptable costs per sale and operating margins. We intend to allocate a significant portion of our media spending on marketing campaigns targeted at the United States, our largest market for future growth. These campaigns will require significant financial resources and may require additional funds depending on the results they generate. There can be no assurance that our marketing campaigns will result in increased revenues or increased product or brand awareness, and we may not be able to increase our sales at the same rate as we increase our advertising expenditures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We may be unable to maintain our customer base in markets where we have an established presence due to changes in consumer preference, perception and spending habits. Our long-term revenue growth and profitability depend upon our ability to apply our business model of selling soda makers to new consumers and our consumables, particularly our CO2 refills and flavors, to consumers who already own our soda makers. Since we derive our highest profit margins from our consumables, the continued use of our systems by, and the repeat sales of our consumables to, consumers who have already purchased our home beverage carbonation systems is important to our business. In markets where we have an established presence, we face the challenge of maintaining this customer base due to changes in consumer preference, perception and habits, as well as the introduction of competing products, any of which may cause our consumers to stop using our systems or to use them less frequently. In order to maintain the use of our systems by our consumers, we will need to navigate quickly and respond accordingly to such changes, including through creative initiatives such as new product offerings and special promotions. Our failure to adequately respond to changes in consumer behavior could result in a reduction in the size of our customer base, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We rely on exclusive arrangements for the distribution of our home beverage carbonation systems and consumables in each of the markets in which we use third party distributors. We distribute our home beverage carbonation systems and consumables through exclusive relationships with third party distributors in 29 countries, representing 32% of our revenues in 2010. Our distribution agreements are generally exclusive agreements for a given territory with a five year term and option of renewal; however, our contracts contain performance criteria to maintain exclusivity. If any distributor fails to meet its distribution targets, we may attempt to terminate our distribution agreement with that distributor. We may not be successful in terminating our distribution agreements with our distributors and even if we are successful, we may have to pay statutory compensation to such distributors or fines, and we may experience a delay in retaining new distributors. Because we rely on third party distributors, we have less control than when we distribute directly and can be adversely impacted by the actions of our distributors. For example, in 2009, we experienced a decrease in revenues from Western Europe primarily because our distributor in the Nordics experienced significant financial difficulty as a result of the recession in that market as well as certain inventory management issues relating to consumables, which have since been resolved. Furthermore, our distributors also undertake to manage the reverse logistics needed for our end-user consumers to return empty CO2 cylinders and exchange them for filled CO2 cylinders. In the event that any of our distributors does not successfully manage those reverse logistics, it will make it more difficult for our end-user consumers to obtain replacement CO2 cylinders, which will negatively affect their attitude towards us and our revenues in that market. Any disruption in our distribution network could have a negative effect on our ability to sell our products and maintain our customer base, which would in turn materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 8 TABLE OF CONTENTS We may be unable to compete effectively with other companies which offer, or may offer in the future, competing products. We face competition in several of our markets from manufacturers of one or more of the components of our home beverage carbonation systems, including the soda makers, exchangeable CO2 cylinders, carbonation bottles and flavors. We anticipate that our success may attract additional competition, both from other manufacturers of home beverage carbonation systems and consumables and the manufacturers of carbonated beverages. The entry of new competitors into our market or the acquisition of our existing competitors by companies with substantial resources could result in further increased competition and harm our business. Increased competition from new competitors may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we compete with suppliers of CO2 who seek to refill our exchangeable CO2 cylinders and other exchangeable CO2 cylinders compatible for use with our systems. For a variety of reasons, including safety and public health, through various contractual arrangements, we generally require customers to refill their CO2 cylinders through authorized refillers. These arrangements have not always been effective in the past and there can be no assurance that they will be effective in the future in deterring unauthorized refilling by our competitors. Additionally, third parties have offered in the past, and may offer in the future, CO2 cylinders and flavors compatible for use in our home beverage carbonation systems. Such sales of consumables by competitors may result in lost sales opportunities for us, decrease our market share and could cause negative publicity if these products cause damage when used with our products. We also face competition from manufacturers who sell counterfeit reproductions of our soda makers. Although we monitor and attempt to take action against such manufacturers where possible, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in deterring competitors from manufacturing and selling counterfeit reproductions of our products. These actions may result in lost sales opportunities and harm to our reputation due to the lower quality of these counterfeit products compared to our products. The risk of counterfeiting may increase with the expansion of our business and increased recognition of our brand name. Finally, we face competition from companies that sell sparkling water and carbonated soft drinks. A number of these competitors are substantially larger than we are and have significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other resources than are available to us, as well as established brands and greater brand awareness. These competitors may use their resources and scale to respond more rapidly than us to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. If any component of our home beverage carbonation systems is misused, the system may fail and cause personal injury or property damage. We may be subject to product liability claims as a result of any such failure, which will likely increase our costs and adversely affect our business and reputation. Although we include explicit instructions for the operation of our home beverage carbonation systems and have placed safety warnings on all of our products, consumers may misuse our products, including by:  washing our non-dishwasher safe carbonation bottles in the dishwasher or otherwise exposing them to severe heat, which could cause the bottle to crack;  carbonating substances other than water with our soda maker, which could cause the soda maker to fail and possibly cause damage to the other components of our home beverage carbonation system; and  subjecting our exchangeable CO2 cylinders to pressure beyond their measured stress resistance, which could cause the cylinder to burst. 9 TABLE OF CONTENTS The misuse of any of the components of our home beverage carbonating systems may cause personal injury and damage to property. In addition, while we have safety approvals from local authorities for our products, these approvals are predicated upon the exclusive use of our proprietary components with our system. Any unauthorized use of our home beverage carbonation system, including by using third party consumables with our system, could lead to failure or malfunction of the system which in turn could cause personal injury or property damage. Potential personal injury and property damage may also result from the deterioration of the quality or contamination of the materials used in our systems, including the tap water used in the soda maker. Our product liability insurance for personal injury and damage to property may not be sufficient or available to cover any successful product liability claim, or similar claims, against us, which could materially adversely impact our financial condition. Whether or not a claim against us would be successful, defense of the claim may be costly and the existence of any claim may adversely impact our reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our products or permit competitors to more easily compete with us and have a material adverse effect on our business, brand, financial condition and results of operations. While we make efforts to develop and protect our intellectual property, the validity, enforceability and commercial value of our intellectual property rights may be reduced or eliminated by the discovery of prior inventions by third parties, the discovery of similar marks previously used by third parties, non-use or non-enforcement by us, the successful independent development by third parties of the same or similar confidential or proprietary innovations or changes in the supply or distribution chains that render our rights obsolete. We have been in the past and may in the future be subject to opposition proceedings with respect to applications for registrations of our intellectual property, including but not limited to our marks. As we rely in part on brand names and trademark protection to enforce our intellectual property rights, barriers to our registration of our brand names and trademarks in various countries may restrict our ability to promote and maintain a cohesive brand throughout our key markets. Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, which include the ability to obtain, protect and enforce patents and trade secrets and other know how relating to our technology. Our current patent portfolio is limited and certain patents of ours that cover significant aspects of our products will expire in the near future. Although we hold additional utility patents and design registrations and patents (as well as applications for such) that may protect certain aspects of our products for an extended period, there can be no assurance that pending United States or foreign applications will be approved in a timely manner or at all, or that such registrations will effectively protect our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that we will develop patentable intellectual property in the future, and we may choose not to pursue patents or other protection for innovations that subsequently turn out to be important. To protect our know-how and trade secrets, we have implemented a system in most jurisdictions by which we require certain of our employees to enter into employment contracts, which include clauses requiring such employees to acknowledge our ownership of all inventions and intellectual property rights they develop in the course of their employment and to agree not to disclose our confidential information. Agreements with certain of our employees also typically contain provisions restricting employment with our competitors for a certain period after they stop working for us. Not all employees have executed such employment agreements, and certain of these restrictions may be of no or little enforceability under applicable law. We also typically include non-compete and confidentiality provisions, as well as provisions acknowledging our ownership of all intellectual property rights, in our distributor and supplier agreements. These provisions may not be adequate or enforceable, and despite our efforts, our know-how and trade secrets could be disclosed to third parties, or third parties could independently develop the same or similar information or technology, which could cause us to lose any competitive advantage resulting from such know-how or trade secrets. 10 TABLE OF CONTENTS From time to time, we may discover that third parties are infringing or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights. For example, we are aware of third party uses of our trademarks and designs, and there may be other third parties using trademarks or names similar to ours of whom we are unaware. Monitoring unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and protecting our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming. The monitoring and protection of our intellectual property rights may become more difficult, costly and time consuming as we expand into new markets, particularly in those markets, such as China, in which legal protection of intellectual property rights is less robust than in the markets in which we currently operate. We are prepared to protect our intellectual property rights vigorously; however, our patent portfolio is limited in certain markets and, as such, we may be unable to institute effective legal action against third parties engaged in copying of our machines and components. In November 2009, we filed a lawsuit in the District Court of Stockholm, Sweden, against a competitor, Vikingsoda AB, which had been refilling our exchangeable CO2 cylinders without our authorization. In the suit, we alleged that Vikingsoda had infringed our intellectual property rights by removing our trademarks from our exchangeable CO2 cylinders and affixing their trademarks to those cylinders. Vikingsoda has filed a complaint with the Swedish Competition Authority against us and our Scandinavian distributor, as more fully described below. In January 2011, a preparatory hearing was held at the District Court of Stockholm addressing our claim that Vikingsoda had infringed our intellectual property rights. A hearing is likely to take place in the latter part of 2011. Should our case be unsuccessful, we will have to compensate Vikingsoda for its litigation costs. It is also possible that Vikingsoda will claim compensation for damages suffered during the period between the granting of the preliminary injunction by the District Court of Stockholm and the Stockholm Court of Appeals decision that the preliminary injunction could not be enforced. There can also be no assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property infringement litigation we institute to protect our intellectual property rights given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in litigation. Such litigation may be time consuming, expensive, and may distract our management from running the day-to-day operations of our business. If we are unable to successfully defend our intellectual property rights, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, brand, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted or will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate to deter the use of our intellectual property rights by third parties or to deter the development of products with features based upon, or otherwise similar to, our products. We may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our products and other intellectual property rights infringe, or may infringe, their proprietary rights. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to claims by third parties asserting misappropriation, or that our products and other intellectual property rights infringe, or may infringe, or otherwise violate their proprietary rights. Any such claims, regardless of merit, could result in litigation, which could result in expenses, divert the attention of management, cause significant delays and materially disrupt the conduct of our business. As a consequence of such claims, we could be required to pay a damage award, develop non-infringing products, enter into royalty-bearing licensing agreements, stop selling our products or re-brand our products. Litigation is inherently uncertain and any adverse decision could result in a loss of our proprietary rights, subject us to liabilities, require us to seek licenses from others, which may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and otherwise negatively affect our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us or our failure or inability to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 11 TABLE OF CONTENTS We have been found to have a dominant position in certain markets. Antitrust and competition laws may place limits on our ability to engage in practices that would be permissible by smaller competitors. Retaining business from refilling our exchangeable CO2 cylinders is important to the long-term success of our business and our future growth. For safety, public health and other reasons, we retain through contractual means the ownership of the exchangeable CO2 cylinders included in our home beverage carbonation systems, whether sold with the system or as a separate component, and prohibit the refilling of the exchangeable CO2 cylinders by third parties not authorized by us. Our agreements with retailers contain an acknowledgement that we retain title to the exchangeable CO2 cylinders. In addition, the packaging in which the cylinders are distributed, as well as the cylinders themselves, bear notices advising consumers that we retain title to the cylinders and that their use of the cylinders is under license. The German Federal Court of Justice, the highest German court, recently upheld a decision by the German Federal Cartel Office that preventing third parties from refilling our exchangeable CO2 cylinders constituted an abuse of a dominant position in violation of EU and German competition law and requiring us to permit our cylinders to be refilled by or exchanged with third parties. In addition, in late 2009, Vikingsoda AB, a refiller of our exchangeable CO2 cylinders in Sweden, filed a complaint with the Swedish Competition Authority against us and our Scandinavian distributor, alleging that we abused a dominant market position. The Swedish Competition Authority is currently investigating our practices and has issued a preliminary opinion that preventing third parties from refilling our exchangeable CO2 cylinders may constitute an abuse of a dominant position. The Swedish Competition Authority submitted this preliminary opinion to the Stockholm Court of Appeal, requesting that the Stockholm Court of Appeal consider the Swedish Competition Authoritys preliminary opinion when deciding on the preliminary injunction that we requested in relation to our claim that Vikingsoda had infringed our intellectual property rights by removing our trademarks from our exchangeable CO2 cylinders and affixing their trademarks to those cylinders. Further, on June 1, 2011, the Swedish Competition Authority, within the context of their investigation, provided us with a draft decision setting out their current position. We are currently preparing a written reply, which, according to the current timetable, should be submitted to Swedish Competition Authority on or about August 31, 2011. As a result, it is, at this stage, not possible to predict the outcome of the Swedish Competition Authoritys investigation. However, if the Swedish Competition Authoritys current position, as expressed in the draft decision, becomes final, we would, among other measures the Swedish Competition Authority may deem necessary, be prohibited from continuing with the allegedly abusive conduct and be ordered to allow third parties to refill our exchangeable CO2 cylinders, in addition to being subject to a fine if the order is not complied with. A final decision by the Swedish Competition Authority is appealable to the Market Court. Although neither the decision of the German Federal Court of Justice nor the preliminary opinion or draft decision of the Swedish Competition Authority is binding on courts in other jurisdictions, any or all could be cited as precedent in other antitrust or competition law proceedings. There can be no assurance that a court of law in any other jurisdiction will determine that we have not violated applicable competition or antitrust laws. For example, there can be no assurance that a court in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate will uphold our refilling restrictions or ownership rights over the exchangeable CO2 cylinders or find that the cylinder refilling restrictions we impose on unauthorized third parties do not violate applicable competition or antitrust laws. Our failure to successfully enforce our ownership rights to our exchangeable CO2 cylinders or to prevent unauthorized third parties from refilling our exchangeable CO2 cylinders could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. As a multinational corporation, our operations are subject to additional risks. With sales in 41 countries, our operations are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations, including:  fluctuations in exchange rates; 12 TABLE OF CONTENTS  unpredictability of foreign currency exchange controls;  compliance with a variety of local regulations and laws;  changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws; and  difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions. In addition, certain jurisdictions could impose tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other similar restrictions on our sales. Moreover, our business operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, and other economic or political uncertainties. All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, either of which could adversely affect our profitability. We are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and may not have adequately hedged against them. We conduct business in multiple countries, which exposes us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the Euro (our reporting currency) and certain other currencies in which we conduct business. Fluctuations of the U.S. Dollar and the NIS against the Euro are the most significant to us because most of our revenues are denominated in Euros, while most of our cost of revenues and operating expenses are denominated in Euros, U.S. Dollars and NIS. Although we currently engage in hedging transactions to minimize our currency risk, future currency exchange rate fluctuations that we have not adequately hedged could adversely affect our profitability. We are also exposed to credit risk if counterparties to our derivative instruments are unable to meet their obligations. Fluctuations in our business caused by seasonality or unusual weather conditions could cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and volatility in the market price of our ordinary shares. Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations because demand for soft drinks is highest in the summer months, while in colder months, consumers tend to drink fewer carbonated beverages. As a result, we ordinarily experience a decline in sales of all of our products during the winter months, other than in December, when we experience an increase in sales as a result of the holidays. In addition, our business is sensitive to unusual weather conditions. For example, if temperatures during the winter are colder than average, we will experience decreased revenues. Because of the seasonality and sensitivity to unusual weather conditions of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. The impact on sales volume and operating results due to the timing and extent of these factors can significantly impact our business. For these reasons, our quarterly operating results should not be relied on as indications of our future performance. These fluctuations may also cause volatility in the market price of our ordinary shares. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. We have endeavored to structure our activities in a manner so as to minimize our and our subsidiaries aggregate tax liabilities. However, we have operations in various taxing jurisdictions, and there is a risk that our tax liabilities in one or more jurisdictions could be more than reported in respect of prior taxable periods and more than anticipated in respect of future taxable periods. In this regard, the amount of income taxes that we pay in future taxable periods could be higher if earnings are lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates. In addition, we have entered into transfer pricing arrangements that establish transfer prices for our inter-company operations. However, our transfer pricing procedures are not binding on the applicable taxing authorities. No official authority in any country has made a binding determination as to whether or not we are operating in compliance with its transfer pricing laws. Accordingly, taxing authorities in any of the countries in which we operate could challenge our transfer prices and require us to adjust them to 13 TABLE OF CONTENTS reallocate our income and potentially to pay additional taxes for past tax periods. For example, following a recent audit, the tax authorities in Germany issued a finding that the amount of royalties we recognized on our CO2 refills are not in compliance with that jurisdictions transfer pricing guidelines and issued a tax assessment of approximately €8.2 million, of which €5.6 million is directly in respect of these royalties for the period from 2003 to 2005. While we have appealed this assessment and are not bound to comply with the assessment during the pendency of this appeal, our appeal may not be successful and we may be required to pay some or the entire amount assessed. In addition, during the pendency of our appeal, we may be required to place a deposit or a guaranty with the tax authorities to cover a portion of or the entire assessed amount, which may have a material adverse affect on our available cash and credit lines. Moreover, in the event that our appeal is unsuccessful, further assessments for tax periods after 2005 could be forthcoming and would likely affect our tax liability on a going-forward basis. We are unable to assess the likelihood that the existing finding of non-compliance in the jurisdiction in which we are having this dispute may lead the taxing authorities of other countries to more closely scrutinize our transfer pricing or issue adverse tax assessments. The issue of the validity of our transfer pricing procedures will become of greater importance as we continue our expansion in markets in which we currently have a limited presence and attempt to penetrate new markets. In particular, the tax authorities in the United States, our most important expansion market, have increased their focus on transfer pricing procedures generally, which could result in a greater likelihood of a challenge to our transfer prices and the risk that we will be required to adjust them and reallocate our income, which could result in a higher effective tax rate than that to which we are currently subject. Any change to the allocation of our income as a result of review by taxing authorities could have a negative effect on our profitability. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, our ultimate tax liability may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially adversely affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. We have created reserves with respect to such tax liabilities where we believe it to be appropriate. However, there can be no assurance that our ultimate tax liability will not exceed the reserves we have created. Our products are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the markets in which we operate. Our products are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the markets in which we operate. Among the regulations we must comply with are those governing the manufacturing and transportation of our exchangeable CO2 cylinders. In the United States, our most significant target market, and in certain other markets in which we currently operate or may in the future operate, our exchangeable CO2 cylinders are considered hazardous materials due to the CO2 inside and the applicable regulations consequently restrict our ability to ship our exchangeable CO2 cylinders by air and also place significant restrictions on their land transportation, which results in additional costs. There can be no assurance that we will comply with all applicable laws and regulations to which we and our products are subject. If we fail to comply, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and reputation. The flavors we manufacture and distribute are also subject to numerous health and safety laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of food products. Our inability to plan and develop effective procedures to address these laws and regulations, and the need to comply with new or revised laws or regulations, or new interpretations or enforcement of existing laws and regulations, may affect our ability to reach our manufacturing and distribution targets, having an overall material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. 14 TABLE OF CONTENTS Furthermore, new government laws and regulations may be introduced in the future that could result in additional compliance costs, seizures, confiscations, recalls or monetary fines, any of which could prevent or inhibit the development, distribution and sale of our products. Recently, the Finance Committee of the United States Senate, as well as several state and local governmental authorities in the United States, have considered enacting a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, including carbonated soft drinks. If such a tax were enacted and if it were to apply to our flavors, the sales and consumption of our non-diet flavors might decrease and thereby have a material adverse impact on our sales and profitability. An increase in the cost or shortage of supply of the raw materials for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We use certain raw materials to produce our soda makers, exchangeable CO2 cylinders and consumables. The most important of these materials are aluminum, brass, CO2, certain plastics and sugar. These materials represent a significant portion of our cost of goods sold. The availability and cost of such raw materials have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future widely due to movements in currency exchange rates, government policy and regulation, crop failures or shortages, weather conditions or other unforeseen circumstances. To the extent that any of the foregoing or other unknown factors increase the prices or limits the supply of such materials and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in a manner that offsets such changes, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to the financial and/or operational instability of key suppliers, distributors, warehousing and transportation providers, or brokers, or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. To the extent we are unable to retain alternative sources of supply, or cannot financially mitigate the impact of such events, such as by identifying an alternative supplier in a timely and cost-effective manner, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, there could be a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability, and additional resources could be required to restore our supply chain. A majority of our products is currently produced at one location that could experience business interruptions, which could result in our inability to produce certain of our products for some period of time, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We currently produce the majority of our products, including certain key components, at a single manufacturing facility. A natural disaster or other unanticipated catastrophic events, including power interruptions, water shortage, storms, fires, earthquakes, terrorist attacks and wars, could significantly impair our ability to manufacture our products at that facility and operate our business. Our facility and certain equipment located in this facility would be difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead-time. Catastrophic events could also destroy any inventory located in this facility. The occurrence of such an event could lead to a halt in production, which would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. We are subject to certain safety risks in our manufacturing facilities. Our business involves complex manufacturing processes and hazardous materials that can be dangerous to our employees. Although we employ safety procedures in the design and operation of our facilities, there is a risk that an accident or death could occur in one of our facilities. Any accident could result in manufacturing delays, which could harm our business and our results of operations. The potential liability resulting from any such accident or death, to the extent not covered by insurance, and any negative publicity associated therewith could harm our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. 15 TABLE OF CONTENTS Because a portion of our manufacturing takes place in China through third party manufacturers, a significant disruption in the operation of those manufacturers or political unrest in China could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We manufacture some of the components of our home beverage carbonation systems through third parties in China. Any disruption in production or inability of our manufacturers in China to produce adequate quantities to meet our needs, whether as a result of a natural disaster or other causes, could impair our ability to operate our business on a day-to-day basis and to meet the growing demand for our products. Furthermore, since these manufacturers are located in China, we are exposed to the possibility of product supply disruption and increased costs in the event of changes in the policies of the Chinese government, political unrest or unstable economic conditions in China. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Higher energy costs and other factors affecting the cost of producing, transporting and distributing our products could adversely affect our financial results. Rising fuel, freight and energy costs have in the past and may in the future have an adverse impact on the cost of our operations, including the manufacture, transportation, and distribution of products. Fuel costs may fluctuate due to a number of factors outside our control, including government policy and regulation and weather conditions. Additionally, we may be unable to maintain favorable arrangements with respect to the costs of transporting products, which could result in increased expenses and negatively affect operations. If we are unable to hedge against such increases or raise the prices of our products to offset the changes, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If our distributors or retailers return a large number of empty exchangeable CO2 cylinders without exchanging them for full ones, we would incur costs with no corresponding revenue. We retain the ownership of the exchangeable CO2 cylinders included in our home beverage carbonation systems through contractual means and collect a deposit from distributors and retailers. The amount of the deposit varies from country to country and also changes over time as market conditions vary in a particular country. In addition, in some countries, including certain major markets in Northern and Western Europe, consumers have paid an advance rental fee when they purchased their first exchangeable CO2 cylinder. A portion of this fee may be refundable when an empty exchangeable CO2 cylinder is returned and not exchanged for a full one. To date, returns of exchangeable CO2 cylinders from our distributors, retailers and consumers have been negligible. However, if distributors, retailers or consumers in any one or more of the markets in which we operate return a large number of cylinders without exchanging them for full ones, we may be required to pay out a large amount of cash to refund a portion of the rental fee or the deposit, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and profitability. Adverse conditions in the global economy could negatively impact our customers demand for our products. Consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products. As a result of the global recession, consumers may have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, reduced access to credit, and sharply falling home prices, among other things. A prolonged economic downturn or recession in any of the countries in which we conduct significant business or in any of the markets we are targeting for expansion, including the United States, may cause significant readjustments in both the volume and mix of our product sales, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. We depend on the expertise of key personnel. If these individuals leave without replacements, our operations could suffer. Our Chief Executive Officer, Daniel Birnbaum, and certain other members of our senior management were retained in 2007 following our acquisition by Fortissimo Capital. Given their extensive knowledge of 16 TABLE OF CONTENTS the home beverage carbonation industry and the limited number of direct competitors in that industry, we believe that it would be difficult to find replacements should any of them leave. Our inability to find suitable replacements for any of the members of our senior management team, particularly Mr. Birnbaum, would adversely impair our ability to implement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We may need to raise additional capital in the future and may be unable to do so on acceptable terms. Based on current expectations, we believe that our cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to finance our strategic plans, including our expansion in markets in which we currently have a limited presence and penetration into certain new markets, for the foreseeable future. However, in the future, we may require additional capital in order to finance even further expansion or possible acquisitions. Our ability to satisfy our future capital needs, if any, will depend upon the costs of such financing and the availability of attractive terms for additional financing. The recent global financial crisis has made it more difficult in general for companies to finance their capital expenditure requirements. We may be unable to obtain requisite financing or such financing may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us. The incurrence of additional debt would result in increased debt service obligations resulting in further operating and financing covenants that might restrict our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. If we were to issue equity to meet our financing needs, it would dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are in the process of determining whether our existing internal controls over financial reporting systems are compliant with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which may divert internal resources and will take a significant amount of time and effort to complete. We will be required to comply with the internal control, evaluation and certification requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ending December 31, 2011. We are in the process of determining whether our existing internal controls over financial reporting systems are compliant with Section 404. This process may divert internal resources and will take a significant amount of time and effort to complete. Irrespective of compliance with Section 404, any failure of our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our stated results of operations and harm our reputation. As a result, we may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses, as well as higher independent auditor fees during and after the implementation of these changes. If we are unable to implement any of the required changes to our internal control over financial reporting effectively or efficiently, it could adversely affect our operations, financial reporting and results of operations and could result in an adverse opinion on internal controls from our independent auditors. Risks related to our Location in Israel As our principal manufacturing facility is located in disputed territory, rising political tensions and negative publicity may negatively impact demand for our products or require us to relocate our manufacturing activities to other locations, either of which may adversely affect our business. Our principal manufacturing facility is located in Mishor Adumim, an area in the West Bank that is the subject of dispute between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Mishor Adumim is currently under Israeli jurisdiction and authority. There has recently been negative publicity, primarily in Western Europe, against companies with facilities in the West Bank. A number of political groups have called for consumer boycotts of Israeli products originating in the West Bank, including our products. Though we manufacture certain of our products in other locations, this may not persuade such political groups sufficiently to end their call to boycott our products. In addition, the Palestinian Authority has adopted legislation that may prohibit or restrict Palestinians from working for Israeli companies located in the West Bank. For these reasons, we may in the future be required to transfer a significant portion of our manufacturing activities to a location outside of the West Bank, which may divert the attention of management, require the 17 TABLE OF CONTENTS expenditure of significant capital resources and limit certain of the tax benefits for which we are currently eligible. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We conduct operations in Israel and, therefore, political, economic and military instability in Israel and its region may adversely affect our business. We are incorporated under Israeli law, and our principal offices and a significant portion of our manufacturing facilities are located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the surrounding region directly affect our business. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have occurred between Israel and its Arab neighbors. A state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has caused security and economic problems in Israel. Although Israel has entered into peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, and various agreements with the Palestinian Authority, there has been a marked increase in violence, civil unrest and hostility, including armed clashes, between the State of Israel and the Palestinians, since September 2000. The establishment in 2006 of a government in the Gaza Strip by representatives of the Hamas militant group has created heightened unrest and uncertainty in the region. In mid-2006, Israel engaged in an armed conflict with Hezbollah, a Shiite Islamist militia group based in Lebanon, and in June 2007, there was an escalation in violence in the Gaza Strip. From December 2008 through January 2009, Israel engaged in an armed conflict with Hamas, which involved missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel and negatively affected business conditions in Israel. Recent political uprisings and social unrest in various countries in the Middle East and north Africa are affecting the political stability of those countries. This instability may lead to deterioration of the political relationships that exist between Israel and these countries, and have raised new concerns regarding security in the region and the potential for armed conflict. Among other things, this instability may affect the global economy and marketplace through changes in oil and gas prices. Continued hostilities between Israel and its neighbors and any future armed conflict, terrorist activity or political instability in the region could adversely affect our operations in Israel and adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares. Further escalation of tensions or violence might result in a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations in Israel and our business. In addition, several countries restrict doing business with Israel. The State of Israel and Israeli companies have been and are today subjected to economic boycotts. The interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations could be disrupted as a result of the obligation of certain of our personnel in Israel to perform military service. Generally, all male adult citizens and permanent residents of Israel under the age of 42 (or older, for citizens who hold certain positions in the Israeli armed forces reserves) are, unless exempt, obligated to perform military reserve duty annually. Additionally, all Israeli residents of this age may be called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances. Many of our officers and employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty. In response to increased tension and hostilities in the region, there have been, at times, call-ups of military reservists, and it is possible that there will be additional call-ups in the future. Our operations could be disrupted by the absence of one or more of our executive officers or key employees for a significant period due to military service. Such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The tax benefits that are available to us require us to continue to meet various conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future, which could increase our costs and taxes. One of our subsidiaries received investment grants and is eligible for tax benefits under the Israeli Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 5719-1959, referred to as the Investment Law, and the 18 TABLE OF CONTENTS Israeli Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 5729-1969. This subsidiary has been granted six separate encouragement of investment programs, of which one is currently active and one program has been approved under the amendment to this law but it has not yet received tax benefits from this program. To remain eligible for these tax benefits, this subsidiary must continue to meet certain conditions stipulated in the Investment Law and its regulations, as amended, and the criteria set forth in the specific certificate of approval. If this subsidiary does not meet these requirements, the tax benefits would be canceled and it could be required to refund any tax benefits and investment grants that it received in the past. Further, in the future these tax benefits may be reduced or discontinued. In April 2005 and in January 2011, amendments to the Investment Law became effective under which the criteria for new investments qualified to receive tax benefits were revised and, in some cases, companies were given the choice whether or not to opt into the new benefit regimes or to remain subject to the previous benefit regimes. In the future, we may not be eligible to receive additional tax benefits under this law. The termination or reduction of these tax benefits would increase our tax liability, which would reduce our profits. Additionally, if we increase our activities outside of Israel through acquisitions, for example, our expanded activities might not be eligible for inclusion in future Israeli tax benefit programs. See Item 10.E  Taxation  Israeli Tax Considerations and Government Programs  Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 5719-1959. It may be difficult to enforce the judgment of a United States court against us, our officers and directors and the Israeli experts named in this annual report in Israel or the United States, or to assert United States securities laws claims in Israel or serve process on our officers and directors and these experts. We are incorporated in Israel. The majority of our executive officers and directors and the Israeli experts named in this annual report are not residents of the United States, and the majority of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. Therefore, it may be difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to enforce a judgment of a United States court based upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal securities laws against us or any of these persons in a United States or Israeli court, or to effect service of process upon these persons in the United States. Additionally, it may be difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to initiate an action with respect to United States securities laws in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of United States securities laws reasoning that Israel is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not United States law is applicable to the claim. If United States law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable United States law must be proven as a fact by expert witnesses, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. There is little binding case law in Israel that addresses the matters described above. As a result of the difficulty associated with enforcing a judgment against us in Israel, you may not be able to collect any damages awarded by either a United States or foreign court. Your rights and responsibilities as our shareholder will be governed by Israeli law, which differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders of United States corporations. Since we are incorporated under Israeli law, the rights and responsibilities of our shareholders are governed by our articles of association and Israeli law. These rights and responsibilities differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders in United States-based corporations. In particular, a shareholder of an Israeli company has a duty to act in good faith towards the company and other shareholders and to refrain from abusing its power in the company, including, among other things, in voting at the general meeting of shareholders on certain matters, such as an amendment to the companys articles of association, an increase of the companys authorized share capital, a merger and approval of related party transactions that require shareholder approval. In addition, a shareholder who knows that it possesses the power to determine the outcome of a shareholders vote or to appoint or prevent the appointment of a director or executive officer in the company has a duty of fairness towards the company. However, Israeli law does not define the substance of this duty of fairness. See Item 6.C  Board Practices  Fiduciary Duties and Approval of Specified Related Party Transactions under 19 TABLE OF CONTENTS Israeli Law  Duties of Shareholders. Because Israeli corporate law underwent extensive revisions approximately ten years ago, the parameters and implications of the provisions that govern shareholder behavior have not been clearly determined. These provisions may be interpreted to impose additional obligations and liabilities on our shareholders that are not typically imposed on shareholders of United States corporations. As a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, we may in the future elect to follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of certain Nasdaq requirements. As a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, we have elected to follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of certain requirements of the Marketplace Rules of The Nasdaq Global Select Market, or the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. We may in the future elect to follow Israeli corporate governance practices with regard to, among other things, the composition of our board of directors, compensation of officers, director nomination procedures and quorum requirements at shareholders meetings. In addition, we may elect to follow Israeli corporate governance practices instead of the Nasdaq requirements to obtain shareholder approval for certain dilutive events (such as for the establishment or amendment of certain equity-based compensation plans, issuances that will result in a change of control of the company, certain transactions other than a public offering involving issuances of a 20% or more interest in the company and certain acquisitions of the stock or assets of another company). Accordingly, our shareholders may not be afforded the same protection as provided under Nasdaqs corporate governance rules. Following our home country governance practices as opposed to the requirements that would otherwise apply to a United States company listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market may provide less protection than is accorded to investors of domestic issuers. See Item 16.G  Corporate Governance. In addition, as a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from the rules and regulations under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, related to the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and our officers, directors, and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, we are not required under the Exchange Act to file annual, quarterly and current reports and financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission as frequently or as promptly as domestic companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act. Provisions of our articles of association and of Israeli law may delay, prevent or make undesirable an acquisition of all or a significant portion of our shares or assets. Our articles of association contain certain provisions that may delay or prevent a change of control. These provisions include a classified board of directors and the requirement of a supermajority vote of our shareholders to amend certain provisions of our articles of association. In addition, Israeli corporate law regulates acquisitions of shares through tender offers and mergers, requires special approvals for transactions involving significant shareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to these types of transactions. Further, Israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions undesirable to us or to some of our shareholders whose country of residence does not have a tax treaty with Israel exempting such shareholders from Israeli tax. For example, Israeli tax law does not recognize tax-free share exchanges to the same extent as United States tax law. With respect to mergers, Israeli tax law allows for tax deferral in certain circumstances but makes the deferral contingent on the fulfillment of numerous conditions, including a holding period of two years from the date of the transaction during which certain sales and dispositions of shares of the participating companies are restricted. Moreover, with respect to certain share swap transactions, the tax deferral is limited in time, and when such time expires, the tax becomes payable even if no actual disposition of the shares has occurred. See Item 10.B  Memorandum and Articles of Association  Acquisitions under Israeli Law. These provisions of Israeli law could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders, and may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for our ordinary shares. 20 TABLE OF CONTENTS Risks related to our Ordinary Shares and the Trading of our Ordinary Shares The price of our ordinary shares may fluctuate significantly. Our ordinary shares were first offered publicly in our IPO in November 2010, at a price of $20.00 per share, and our ordinary shares have subsequently traded as high as $63.20 per share and as low as $23.15 per share. In the recent past, stocks generally have experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our ordinary shares may fluctuate significantly. Fluctuations in the market price of our ordinary shares may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our ordinary shares is too low. The lack of a trading market may result in the loss of research coverage by any one or more of the securities analysts that may cover our company in the future. Moreover, we cannot assure you that any securities analyst will initiate or maintain research coverage of us and our ordinary shares. The price of the ordinary shares sold in this offering will not necessarily reflect the market price of our ordinary shares after this offering. The market price for our ordinary shares after this offering will be affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation:  an increase or decrease in our revenue;  quarterly variations in our results of operations or in our competitors results of operations;  announcements or introductions of new products by us or competitors;  the recruitment or departure of key personnel;  regulatory developments;  changes in earnings estimates, investors perceptions or recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts earning estimates;  developments in our industry;  sales of ordinary shares by us or our shareholders; and  general market conditions and political and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors. These factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares and result in significant price fluctuations. In the past, many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have become subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. Sales of our outstanding ordinary shares into the market in the future could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well. Upon completion of our follow-on offering, we had 19,946,961 shares outstanding, of which 13,807,293 shares are freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act. We, each of our officers, directors and the selling shareholders have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, with the underwriters not to dispose of or hedge any of their ordinary shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable for ordinary shares for a period of 90 days after April 14, 2011, subject to extension in the case of an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to us and, except in our case, for the issuance of ordinary shares upon exercise of options under existing option plans. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. may, in their sole discretion and without notice, release all or any portion of the ordinary shares subject to lock-up agreements. Starting on May 8, 2011, subject to the lock-up agreements described above, holders of 4,160,631 of our ordinary shares will be entitled to 21 TABLE OF CONTENTS request that we register their shares for resale and certain other shareholders have the right to include their shares in any such registration statement or in a registration statement for any public offering we undertake in the future. To the extent that any of these shareholders sell, or indicate an intent to sell, substantial amounts of our ordinary shares in the public market after the contractual lock-ups and other legal restrictions on resale discussed in this annual report lapse, the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline significantly. In addition, on November 3, 2010, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-8 registering up to 2,195,838 ordinary shares that we may issue under our option plans. These ordinary shares may be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to the lock-up agreements described above. The registration or sale of any of these ordinary shares could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to drop significantly. The ownership of our ordinary shares will continue to be highly concentrated, and your interests may conflict with the interests of our existing shareholders. Our executive officers, directors and their affiliates beneficially own approximately 18.8% of our outstanding ordinary shares. Moreover, one of our largest shareholders, Fortissimo Capital, beneficially owns approximately 11.4% of our outstanding ordinary shares. In addition, individual partners of this shareholder serve on our board of directors. Accordingly, this shareholder will exercise a significant influence on us and will continue to be able to significantly influence the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, amending our articles of association, raising future capital, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction. This shareholder could delay or prevent a change of control of our company, even if such a change of control would benefit our other shareholders. The significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares due to investors perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise. If securities or industry analysts cease to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. We expect that the trading price for our ordinary shares will be affected by any research or reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who currently cover us or our business publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us or our business, and in particular if they downgrade their evaluations of our ordinary shares, the price of our ordinary shares would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market for our ordinary shares, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. We do not expect to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. We do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our existing operations. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is currently limited by the terms of our credit facilities, and any future credit facility may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our ordinary shares. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their ordinary shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any return on their investment. As a result, investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our ordinary shares. Our United States shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are characterized as a Passive Foreign Investment Company. Generally, if for any taxable year 75% or more of our gross income is passive income, or at least 50% of our assets are held for the production of, or produce, passive income, we would be characterized as a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes. To determine if at least 50% of our assets are held for the production of, or produce, passive income, we may use the market 22 TABLE OF CONTENTS capitalization method for certain periods. Under the market capitalization method, the total asset value of a company would be considered to equal the fair market value of its outstanding shares plus outstanding indebtedness on a relevant testing date. Because the market price of our ordinary shares is likely to fluctuate and may be volatile, and the market price may affect the determination of whether we will be considered a passive foreign investment company, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year. If we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company, our United States shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences, including having gains realized on the sale of our ordinary shares treated as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, the loss of the preferential rate applicable to dividends received on our ordinary shares by individuals who are United States holders, and having interest charges apply to distributions by us and the proceeds of share sales. See Item 9.E  Taxation  United States federal income taxation. 23 TABLE OF CONTENTS
