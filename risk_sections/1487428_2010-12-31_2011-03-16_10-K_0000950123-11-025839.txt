Risk Factors Investing in our common stock involves a number of significant risks. In addition to the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, you should consider carefully the following information before making an investment in our common stock. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not presently deemed material by us might also impair our operations and performance. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, our net asset value and the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment. Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure We have a limited operating history and may not be able to achieve our investment objective or generate sufficient revenue to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders and your investment in us could decline substantially. We commenced operations in March 2008 and became a public company in October 2010. As a result of our limited operating history, we are subject to certain business risks and uncertainties associated with any recently formed business enterprise, including the risk that we will not achieve our investment objective and that the value of your investment in us could decline substantially. As a public company, we are subject to the regulatory requirements of the SEC, in addition to the specific regulatory requirements applicable to business development companies under the 1940 Act and RICs under the Code. Our management and our Advisor have limited experience operating under this regulatory framework, because we have been public since October 28, 2010, and we may incur substantial additional costs, and expend significant time or other resources, to do so. From time to time our Advisor may pursue investment opportunities, like equity investments, in which our Advisor has more limited experience. We may also be unable to replicate the historical performance of prior investment funds. In addition, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue from our operations to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders. We may not replicate the historical results achieved by other entities managed or sponsored by members of our Advisor or its affiliates. We may be unable to replicate the historical results achieved by our Advisor or its affiliates, and our investment returns could be substantially lower than the returns achieved by them in prior periods. In particular, our Advisors returns from several of its other investment vehicles may not be comparable because they were capital call funds and their respective returns were not negatively impacted by uninvested cash. We also may not be able to replicate the performance of our warrants and may not have returns on warrants from our existing portfolio that we hold. Neither our Advisor nor its affiliates were subject to the same tax and regulatory conditions that we intend to operate under following the offering. Furthermore, none of the prior results were from public reporting companies. Additionally, all or a portion of these prior results may have been achieved in particular market conditions which may never be repeated. We are not a capital call fund and, as a result, may have more limited access to cash for investment opportunities than our Advisor historically experienced which could impair our ability to make future investments. Moreover, current or future market volatility and regulatory uncertainty may also have an adverse impact on our future performance. We and our Advisor have limited experience operating under the constraints imposed on a business development company or managing an investment company, which may affect our ability to manage our business and impair your ability to assess our prospects. Prior to becoming a public company, we did not operate as a business development company or manage an investment company under the 1940 Act. As a result, we have limited operating results under this regulatory framework that can demonstrate to you either its effect on our business or our ability to manage our business within this framework. The 1940 Act imposes numerous constraints on the operations of business development companies. For example, business development companies are required to invest at least 70% of their total assets in specified types of securities, primarily securities of eligible portfolio companies (as defined in the 1940 Act), cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. See 25 Table of Contents Regulation in Item 1 above. Our Advisors lack of experience in managing a portfolio of assets under these constraints may hinder our ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and, as a result, could impair our ability to achieve our investment objective. Furthermore, if we are unable to comply with the requirements imposed on business development companies by the 1940 Act, the SEC could bring an enforcement action against us and/or we could be exposed to claims of private litigants. In addition, we could be regulated as a closed-end management investment company under the 1940 Act, which could further decrease our operating flexibility and may prevent us from operating our business, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We are dependent upon key personnel of our Advisor and our Advisors ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. We depend on the members of our Advisors senior management, particularly Mr. Pomeroy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Michaud, our President, as well as other key personnel for the identification, evaluation, final selection, structuring, closing and monitoring of our investments. These employees have critical industry experience and relationships that we will rely on to implement our business plan to originate Technology Loans in our Target Industries. Our future success will depend on the continued service of Messrs. Pomeroy and Michaud as well as the other senior members of our Advisors management team. If our Advisor were to lose the services of either Mr. Pomeroy or Mr. Michaud or any of the other senior members of our Advisors management team, we may not be able to operate our business as we expect, and our ability to compete could be harmed, either of which could cause our business, results of operations or financial condition to suffer. In addition, if either of Mr. Pomeroy or Mr. Michaud ceases to be employed by us, the lender under our Credit Facility could, absent a waiver or cure, demand repayment of any outstanding obligations under the Credit Facility. Our future success will also depend, in part, on our Advisors ability to identify, attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees. Absent exemptive or other relief granted by the SEC and for so long as we remain externally managed, the 1940 Act will prevent us from granting options to our employees and adopting a profit sharing plan, which may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain highly skilled employees. If we are not successful in identifying, attracting and retaining these employees, we may not be able to operate our business as we expect. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our Advisor will remain our investment Advisor or that we will continue to have access to our Advisors investment professionals or its relationships. For example, our Advisor may in the future manage investment funds with investment objectives similar to ours thereby diverting the time and attention of its investment professionals that we rely on to implement our business plan. We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected and the value of your investment in us could decline. A number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we plan to make in prospective portfolio companies in our Target Industries. We compete with other business development companies and a large number of venture capital and private equity firms, as well as other investment funds, investment banks and other sources of financing, including traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and finance companies. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. This may enable these competitors to make commercial loans with interest rates that are comparable to, or lower than, the rates we typically offer. We may lose prospective portfolio companies if we do not match our competitors pricing, terms and structure. If we do match our competitors pricing, terms or structure, we may experience decreased net interest income and increased risk of credit losses. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships than us and build their market shares. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a business development company or that the Code imposes on us as a RIC. If we are not able to compete effectively, we may not be able to identify and take advantage of attractive investment opportunities that we identify and may not be able to fully invest our available capital. If this occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 26 Table of Contents We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us. Leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique, and we intend to continue to borrow money as part of our business plan. The use of leverage will magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and, therefore, increases the risks associated with investing in us. We expect to borrow from and issue senior debt securities to banks and other lenders. Such senior debt securities include those under the Credit Facility pursuant to which we may borrow up to $125 million on or before March 4, 2011. As of December 31, 2010, we had outstanding indebtedness of $87.4 million. We also intend to issue debt securities guaranteed by the SBA and sold in the capital markets, to the extent that we or one of our subsidiaries becomes licensed by the SBA. The SBIC regulations, subject to certain regulatory capital requirements among other things, currently permit an SBIC subsidiary to borrow up to $150 million. Lenders of senior debt securities, including the SBA, will have fixed dollar claims on our assets that will be superior to the claims of our common stockholders. If the value of our assets increases, then leveraging would cause the net asset value attributable to our common stock to increase more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged. However, any decrease in our income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged. This decline could adversely affect our ability to make common stock dividend payments. In addition, because our investments may be illiquid, we may be unable to dispose of them or to do so at a favorable price in the event we need to do so if we are unable to refinance any indebtedness upon maturity, and, as a result, we may suffer losses. Our ability to service any debt that we incur depends largely on our financial performance and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures. Moreover, as our Advisors management fee is payable to our Advisor based on our gross assets, including those assets acquired through the use of leverage, our Advisor may have a financial incentive to incur leverage which may not be consistent with our stockholders interests. In addition, holders of our common stock bear the burden of any increase in our expenses, as a result of leverage, including any increase in the management fee payable to our Advisor. Illustration: The following table illustrates the effect of leverage on returns from an investment in our common stock assuming various annual returns, net of expenses. The calculations in the table below are hypothetical and actual returns may be higher or lower than those appearing in the table below: Assumed Return on Our Portfolio (Net of Expenses) (10%) (5%) 0% 5% 10% Corresponding return to stockholder(1) (19 %) (11 %) (2 %) 6 % 15 % (1) Assumes $216 million in total assets, $87 million in debt outstanding, $127 million in stockholders equity, and an average cost of funds of 3.16%. Assumptions are based on our financial condition and our average costs of funds at December 31, 2010. Actual interest payments may be different. If we are unable to comply with the covenants or restrictions in the Credit Facility, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Horizon Credit I LLC, which we refer to as Credit I, is party to our Credit Facility with WestLB AG. This Credit Facility includes covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of Compass Horizon and Credit I to make loans to, or investments in, third parties (other than Technology Loans and warrants or other equity participation rights), pay dividends and distributions, incur additional indebtedness and engage in mergers or consolidations. The Credit Facility also restricts the ability of Compass Horizon, Credit I, and our Advisor to create liens on the collateral securing the Credit Facility, permit additional negative pledges on such collateral and change the business currently conducted by them. The Credit Facility also includes provisions that permit our lender to refuse to advance funds under the facility in the event of a change of control of us or Compass Horizon. For this purpose a change of control generally means a merger or other consolidation, a liquidation, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or a transaction in which any person or group acquires more than 50% of our shares. In addition, the Credit Facility also requires Compass Horizon, Credit I and our Advisor to comply with various financial covenants, including, among other covenants, maintenance by Compass Horizon and our Advisor of a minimum tangible net worth and limitations on the value of, and modifications to, the loan collateral that 27 Table of Contents secures the Credit Facility. See Item 7 below, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources. Complying with these restrictions may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would help us to grow our business or are otherwise consistent with our investment objective. These restrictions could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs or otherwise restrict corporate activities or could result in our failing to qualify as a RIC and thus becoming subject to corporate-level income tax. See Item 7 below, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information regarding our credit arrangements. The breach of certain of the covenants or restrictions unless cured within the applicable grace period, would result in a default under the Credit Facility that would permit the lender to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness and the lender may exercise rights available to it under the security interest granted in the assets of Credit I, including, to the extent permitted under applicable law, the seizure of such assets without adjudication. As a result, any default could have serious consequences to our financial condition. An event of default or an acceleration under the Credit Facility could also cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of another debt instrument or contractual obligation, which would adversely impact our liquidity. We may not be granted waivers or amendments to the Credit Facility if for any reason we are unable to comply with it, and we may not be able to refinance the Credit Facility on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Because we will distribute all or substantially all of our income and any realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses to our stockholders, we will need additional capital to finance our growth, if any. If additional funds are unavailable or not available on favorable terms, our ability to grow will be impaired. To satisfy the requirements applicable to a RIC, to avoid payment of excise taxes and to minimize or avoid payment of corporate-level federal income taxes, we intend to distribute to our stockholders all or substantially all of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses except that we may retain certain net long-term capital gains, pay applicable income taxes with respect thereto, and elect to treat such retained capital gains as deemed distributions to our stockholders. As a business development company, we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities, which includes all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200%. This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. Because we will continue to need capital to grow our loan and investment portfolio, this limitation may prevent us from incurring debt and require us to raise additional equity at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. We cannot assure you that debt and equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, and debt financings may be restricted by the terms of any of our outstanding borrowings. In addition, as discussed below, as a business development company, we are limited in our ability to issue equity securities priced below net asset value. If additional funds are not available to us, we could be forced to curtail or cease new lending and investment activities, and our net asset value could decline. If we are unable to obtain additional debt financing, our business could be materially adversely affected. We may want to obtain additional debt financing, or need to do so upon maturity of the Credit Facility, in order to obtain funds which may be made available for investments. The Credit Facility matures in March 2015. We were able to request advances under the Credit Facility through March 4, 2011. We may not request new advances and we must repay the outstanding advances under the Credit Facility as of such date at such times and in such amounts as are necessary to maintain compliance with the terms and conditions of the Credit Facility, particularly the condition that the principal balance of the Credit Facility does not exceed 75% of the aggregate principal balance of our eligible loans to our portfolio companies. All outstanding advances under the Credit Facility are due and payable on March 4, 2015, unless such date is extended upon Credit Is request and upon mutual agreement of WestLB and Credit I. If we are unable to increase, renew or replace any such facility and enter into a new debt financing facility on commercially reasonable terms, our liquidity may be reduced significantly. In addition, if we are unable to repay amounts outstanding under any such facilities and are declared in default or are unable to renew or refinance these facilities, we may not be able to make new investments or operate our business in the normal course. These 28 Table of Contents situations may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as lack of access to the credit markets, a severe decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, a further economic down turn or an operational problem that affects third parties or us, and could materially damage our business. If we do not receive qualification from the SBA to form an SBIC or we are unable to comply with SBA regulations after our SBIC subsidiary is formed, our business plan and investment objective could be materially adversely affected. We are currently seeking qualification as an SBIC for Longview SBIC LP, our wholly owned subsidiary, which will be regulated by the SBA. On July 14, 2009, our Advisor received notification from the SBA that invited our Advisor to continue with the application process for licensing this subsidiary as an SBIC. On December 6, 2010 our subsidiary filed an application for a license to operate as a small business investment company. On December 21, 2010 we received a letter from the SBA that it had accepted our application for filing. However, the application to license this subsidiary as an SBIC is subject to SBA approval. If we do not receive SBA approval to license an SBIC our business plan and investment objective could be materially adversely affected. If our subsidiary receives this qualification, it will become subject to SBA regulations that may constrain our activities or our subsidiary. We may need to make allowances in our investment activity or the investment activity of our subsidiaries to comply with SBA regulations. In addition, SBA regulations may impose parameters on our business operations and investment objectives that are different than what we otherwise would do if we were not subject to these regulations. Failure to comply with the SBA regulations could result in the loss of the SBIC license and the resulting inability to participate in the SBA-sponsored debenture program. The SBA also limits the maximum amount that may be borrowed by any single SBIC. The SBA prohibits, without prior SBA approval, a change of control of an SBIC or transfers that would result in any person (or a group of persons acting in concert) owning 10% or more of a class of capital stock of a licensed SBIC. A change of control is any event which would result in the transfer of the power, direct or indirect, to direct the management and policies of an SBIC, whether through ownership, contractual arrangements or otherwise. To the extent that our subsidiary receives a license to operate as an SBIC, this would prohibit a change of control of us without prior SBA approval. If we are unable to comply with SBA regulations, our business plan and growth strategy could be materially adversely affected. Changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net investment income. Because we currently incur indebtedness to fund our investments, a portion of our income depends upon the difference between the interest rate at which we borrow funds and the interest rate at which we invest these funds. Some of our investments have fixed interest rates, while our borrowings have floating interest rates. As a result, a significant change in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds could increase, which would reduce our net investment income. We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as swaps, futures, options and forward contracts, subject to applicable legal requirements, including, without limitation, all necessary registrations (or exemptions from registration) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. These activities may limit our ability to benefit from lower interest rates with respect to the hedged portfolio. We also have limited experience in entering into hedging transactions, and we will initially have to rely on the advice of outside parties with respect to the use of these financial instruments or develop this expertise internally. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions or any adverse developments from our use of hedging instruments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be unable to enter into appropriate hedging transactions when desired and any hedging transactions we enter into may not be effective. Because many of our investments typically are not and will not be in publicly traded securities, the value of our investments may not be readily determinable, which could adversely affect the determination of our net asset value. Our investments consist, and we expect our future investments to consist, primarily of loans or securities issued by privately held companies. As a result, the fair value of these investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. In addition, we are not permitted to maintain a general reserve for anticipated loan losses. 29 Table of Contents Instead, we are required by the 1940 Act to specifically value each investment and record an unrealized gain or loss for any asset that we believe has increased or decreased in value. We value these investments on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as circumstances require, in accordance with our valuation policy consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. Our board of directors employs an independent third-party valuation firm to assist them in arriving at the fair value of our investments. The board of directors will discuss valuations and determine the fair value in good faith based on the input of our Advisor and the third-party valuation firm. The factors that may be considered in fair value pricing our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio companys earnings and its ability to make payments on its indebtedness, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow and other relevant factors. Because such valuations are inherently uncertain and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would be assessed if a ready market for these securities existed. Our net asset value could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of our investments are materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of these investments. Disruption in the capital markets and the credit markets could adversely affect our business. Without sufficient access to the capital markets or credit markets, we may be forced to curtail our business operations or we may not be able to pursue new investment opportunities. Beginning in 2007, the global capital markets entered into a period of disruption and extreme volatility and, accordingly, there has been and will continue to be uncertainty in the financial markets in general. Ongoing disruptive conditions in the financial industry could restrict our business operations and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. We are unable to predict when economic and market conditions may become more favorable. Even if these conditions improve significantly over the long term, adverse conditions in particular sectors of the financial markets could adversely impact our business. We may not realize gains from our equity investments. All of our investments that we have made in the past include, and investments we may make in the future are expected to include, warrants. In addition, we may from time to time make non-control, equity co-investments in companies in conjunction with private equity sponsors. Our goal with respect to these equity investments is to ultimately realize gains upon disposition. The equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience. We also may be unable to realize any value if a portfolio company does not have a liquidity event, such as a sale of the business, refinancing or public offering, which would allow us to sell the underlying equity interests. In addition, the time and attention of the investment personnel of our Advisor could be diverted from managing our debt portfolio in order to manage any equity investments we receive thereby impacting the value of our remaining portfolio, and our Advisors significant experience in Technology Lending may not result in returns on our equity investments. From time to time we may also acquire equity participation rights in connection with an investment which will allow us, at our option, to participate in future rounds of equity financing through direct capital investments in our portfolio companies. Our Advisor will determine whether to exercise any of these rights. Accordingly, you will have no control over whether or to what extent these rights are exercised, if at all. If we exercise these rights, we will be making an additional investment completely in the form of equity which will subject us to significantly more risk than our Technology Loans and we may not receive the returns that are anticipated with respect to these investments. We may not realize expected returns on warrants received in connection with our debt investments. As discussed above, we generally receive warrants in connection with our debt investments. If we do not receive the returns that are anticipated on the warrants, our investment returns on our portfolio companies, and the value of your investment in us, may be lower than expected. 30 Table of Contents Regulations governing our operation as a business development company affect our ability to, and the way in which, we raise additional capital, which may expose us to additional risks. Our business plans contemplate a need for a substantial amount of capital in addition to our current amount of capital. We may obtain additional capital through the issuance of debt securities, other indebtedness or preferred stock, and we may borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as senior securities, up to the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. Moreover, in connection with the filing of the SBA license application, we expect to seek exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of the SBIC subsidiary guaranteed by the SBA from the 200% consolidated asset coverage ratio requirements. If we issue senior securities, we would be exposed to typical risks associated with leverage, including an increased risk of loss. In addition, if we issue preferred stock, it would rank senior to common stock in our capital structure and preferred stockholders would have separate voting rights and may have rights, preferences or privileges more favorable than those of holders of our common stock. The 1940 Act permits us to issue senior securities in amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. If our asset coverage ratio is not at least 200%, we will not be permitted to pay dividends or issue additional senior securities. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy this asset coverage test. If that happens, we may be required to liquidate a portion of our investments and repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when we may be unable to do so or to do so on favorable terms. As a business development company, we generally are not able to issue our common stock at a price below net asset value without first obtaining the approval of our stockholders and our independent directors. This requirement will not apply to stock issued upon the exercise of options, warrants or rights that we may issue from time to time. If we raise additional funds by issuing more common stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, the percentage ownership of our stockholders at that time would decrease, and you may experience dilution. If we are unable to satisfy the requirements under the Code for qualification as a RIC, we will be subject to corporate-level federal income tax. To qualify as a RIC under the Code, we must meet certain source-of-income, diversification and other requirements contained in Subchapter M of the Code and maintain our election to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. We must also meet the Annual Distribution Requirement to avoid corporate-level federal income tax in that year on all of our taxable income, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. The source-of-income requirement is satisfied if we derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest (including tax-exempt interest), payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, other income (including but not limited to gain from options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to our business of investing in stock, securities or currencies, or net income derived from an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership. The status of certain forms of income we receive could be subject to different interpretations under the Code and might be characterized as non-qualifying income that could cause us to fail to qualify as a RIC, assuming we do not qualify for or take advantage of certain remedial provisions, and, thus, may cause us to be subject to corporate-level federal income taxes. The annual distribution requirement for a RIC is satisfied if we distribute to our stockholders on an annual basis an amount equal to at least 90% of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any. If we borrow money, we may be subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the 1940 Act and loan covenants that could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to qualify as a RIC. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify as a RIC, assuming we do not qualify for or take advantage of certain remedial provisions, and, thus, may be subject to corporate-level income tax. 31 Table of Contents To qualify as a RIC, we must also meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each calendar quarter. Failure to meet these tests may result in our having to (i) dispose of certain investments quickly; (ii) raise additional capital to prevent the loss of RIC status; or (iii) engage in certain remedial actions that may entail the disposition of certain investments at disadvantageous prices that could result in substantial losses, and the payment of penalties, if we qualify to take such actions. Because most of our investments are and will be in development-stage companies within our Target Industries, any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices and may result in substantial losses. If we raise additional capital to satisfy the asset diversification requirements, it could take a longer time to invest such capital. During this period, we will invest in temporary investments, such as cash and cash equivalents, which we expect will earn yields substantially lower than the interest income that we anticipate receiving in respect of our investments in secured and amortizing loans. If we were to fail to qualify for the federal income tax benefits allowable to RICs for any reason and become subject to a corporate-level federal income tax, the resulting taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution to our stockholders, and the actual amount of our distributions. Such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us, the net asset value of our common stock and the total return, if any, obtainable from your investment in our common stock. In addition, we could be required to recognize unrealized gains, pay substantial taxes and interest and make substantial distributions before requalifying as a RIC. See Regulation. We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize taxable income before or without receiving cash. We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example if we hold debt instruments that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in taxable income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the debt instrument, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because in certain cases we may recognize taxable income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement that we distribute an amount equal to at least 90% of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized long-term capital losses, if any (the Annual Distribution Requirement). For example, the proportion of our income that resulted from original issue discount for both of the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 was approximately 8.2%. Accordingly, we may need to sell some of our assets at times that we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or forego new investment opportunities or otherwise take actions that are disadvantageous to our business (or be unable to take actions that we believe are necessary or advantageous to our business) in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may fail to qualify for the federal income tax benefits allowable to RICs and, thus, become subject to a corporate-level federal income tax on all our income. If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could fail to qualify as a business development company or be precluded from investing according to our current business strategy. As a business development company, we are prohibited from acquiring any assets other than qualifying assets unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such acquisition, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets. Substantially all of our assets are qualifying assets and we expect that substantially all of our assets that we may acquire in the future will be qualifying assets, although we may decide to make other investments that are not qualifying assets to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. If we acquire debt or equity securities from an issuer that has outstanding marginable securities at the time we make an investment, these acquired assets may not be treated as qualifying assets. This result is dictated by the definition of eligible portfolio company under the 1940 Act, which in part looks to whether a company has outstanding marginable securities. See Item 1 above, Regulation  Qualifying Assets. If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could lose our status as a business development company, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 32 Table of Contents Changes in laws or regulations governing our business could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in the laws or regulations or the interpretations of the laws and regulations that govern business development companies, RICs, SBICs or non-depository commercial lenders could significantly affect our operations, our cost of doing business and our investment strategy. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations and judicial and administrative decisions that affect our operations, including our loan originations, maximum interest rates, fees and other charges, disclosures to portfolio companies, the terms of secured transactions, collection and foreclosure procedures, portfolio composition and other trade practices. If these laws, regulations or decisions change, or if we expand our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent requirements, we may incur significant expenses to comply with these laws, regulations or decisions or we might have to restrict our operations or alter our investment strategy. For example, any change to the SBAs current debenture SBIC program could have a significant impact on our ability to obtain lower-cost leverage and our ability to compete with other finance companies. In addition, if we do not comply with applicable laws, regulations and decisions, we may lose licenses needed for the conduct of our business and be subject to civil fines and criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our Advisor has significant potential conflicts of interest with us and our stockholders. As a result of our arrangements with our Advisor, there may be times when our Advisor has interests that differ from those of our stockholders, giving rise to a potential conflict of interest. Our executive officers and directors, as well as the current and future executives and employees of our Advisor, serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of our stockholders. In addition, our Advisor may manage other funds in the future that may have investment objectives that are similar, in whole or in part, to ours. Our Advisor may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such an event, depending on the availability of the investment and other appropriate factors, our Advisor will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner. It is also possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in these other investment opportunities. We pay management and incentive fees to our Advisor and reimburse our Advisor for certain expenses it incurs. As a result, investors in our common stock invest on a gross basis and receive distributions on a net basis after expenses, resulting in a lower rate of return than an investor might achieve through direct investments. Also, the incentive fee payable by us to our Advisor may create an incentive for our Advisor to pursue investments on our behalf that are riskier or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangements. We have entered into a license agreement with Horizon Technology Finance, LLC, pursuant to which it has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the service mark Horizon Technology Finance. Under this agreement, we have a right to use the Horizon Technology Finance service mark for so long as the Investment Management Agreement is in effect between us and our Advisor. In addition, we pay our Advisor, our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by our Advisor in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions, and our allocable portion of the compensation of our chief financial officer and any administrative support staff. Any potential conflict of interest arising as a result of our arrangements with our Advisor could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our incentive fee may impact our Advisors structuring of our investments, including by causing our Advisor to pursue speculative investments. The incentive fee payable by us to our Advisor may create an incentive for our Advisor to pursue investments on our behalf that are riskier or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangement. The incentive fee payable to our Advisor is calculated based on a percentage of our return on invested capital. This may encourage our Advisor to use leverage to increase the return on our investments. Under certain 33 Table of Contents circumstances, the use of leverage may increase the likelihood of default, which would impair the value of our common stock. In addition, our Advisor receives the incentive fee based, in part, upon net capital gains realized on our investments. Unlike that portion of the incentive fee based on income, there is no hurdle rate applicable to the portion of the incentive fee based on net capital gains. As a result, our Advisor may have a tendency to invest more capital in investments that are likely to result in capital gains as compared to income-producing securities. Such a practice could result in our investing in more speculative securities than would otherwise be the case, which could result in higher investment losses, particularly during economic downturns. In addition, the incentive fee may encourage our Advisor to pursue different types of investments or structure investments in ways that are more likely to result in warrant gains or gains on equity investments, including upon exercise of equity participation rights, which are inconsistent with our investment strategy and disciplined underwriting process. The incentive fee payable by us to our Advisor also may induce our Advisor to pursue investments on our behalf that have a deferred interest feature, even if such deferred payments would not provide cash necessary to enable us to pay current distributions to our stockholders. Under these investments, we would accrue interest over the life of the investment but would not receive the cash income from the investment until the end of the term. Our net investment income used to calculate the income portion of our investment fee, however, includes accrued interest. Thus, a portion of this incentive fee would be based on income that we have not yet received in cash. In addition, the catch-up portion of the incentive fee may encourage our Advisor to accelerate or defer interest payable by portfolio companies from one calendar quarter to another, potentially resulting in fluctuations in the timing and amounts of dividends. Our governing documents do not limit the number of loans we may make with deferred interest features or the proportion of our income we derive from such loans. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we derived approximately 4.3% and 3.4%, respectively, of our income from the deferred interest component of our loans and approximately 4.0% and 4.8%, respectively, of our income from discount accretion associated with warrants we have received in connection with the making of our loans. If we are unable to manage our future growth effectively, we may be unable to achieve our investment objective, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and cause the value of your investment in us to decline. Our ability to achieve our investment objective depends on our ability to achieve and sustain growth, which depends, in turn, on our Advisors direct origination capabilities and disciplined underwriting process in identifying, evaluating, financing, investing in and monitoring suitable companies that meet our investment criteria. Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis is largely a function of our Advisors marketing capabilities, management of the investment process, ability to provide efficient services and access to financing sources on acceptable terms. In addition to monitoring the performance of our existing investments, our Advisor may also be called upon to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. These demands on their time may distract them or slow the rate of investment. If we fail to manage our future growth effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected and the value of your investment in us could decrease. Our board of directors may change our operating policies and strategies, including our investment objective, without prior notice or stockholder approval, the effects of which may adversely affect our business. Our board of directors may modify or waive our current operating policies and strategies, including our investment objectives, without prior notice and without stockholder approval (provided that no such modification or waiver may change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a business development company as provided by the 1940 Act without stockholder approval at a special meeting called upon written notice of not less than ten or more than sixty days before the date of such meeting). We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies would have on our business, results of operations or financial condition or on the value of our stock. However, the effects of any changes might adversely affect our business, any or all of which could negatively impact our ability to pay dividends or cause you to lose all or part of your investment in us. 34 Table of Contents Our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate due to the nature of our business. We could experience fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: our ability to make investments in companies that meet our investment criteria, the interest rate payable on our loans, the default rate on these investments, the level of our expenses, variations in, and the timing of, the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets and general economic conditions. For example, we have historically experienced greater investment activity during the second and fourth quarters relative to other periods. As a result of these factors, you should not rely on the results for any prior period as being indicative of our performance in future periods. Our business plan and growth strategy depends to a significant extent upon our Advisors referral relationships. If our Advisor is unable to develop new or maintain existing relationships, or if these relationships fail to generate investment opportunities, our business could be materially adversely affected. We have historically depended on our Advisors referral relationships to generate investment opportunities. For us to achieve our future business objectives, members of our Advisor will need to maintain these relationships with venture capital and private equity firms and management teams and legal firms, accounting firms, investment banks and other lenders, and we will rely to a significant extent upon these relationships to provide us with investment opportunities. If they fail to maintain their existing relationships or develop new relationships with other firms or sources of investment opportunities, we may not be able to grow our investment portfolio. In addition, persons with whom our Advisor has relationships are not obligated to provide us with investment opportunities, and, therefore, there is no assurance that such relationships will lead to the origination of debt or other investments. Our Advisor can resign on 60 days notice and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Under our Investment Management Agreement, our Advisor has the right to resign at any time, including during the first two years following the Investment Management Agreements effective date, upon not more than 60 days written notice, whether we have found a replacement or not. If our Advisor resigns, we may not be able to find a new investment Advisor or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within 60 days, or at all. If we are unable to do so, our operations are likely to be disrupted, our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to pay distributions may be adversely affected and the market price of our shares may decline. In addition, the coordination of our internal management and investment activities is likely to suffer if we are unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our Advisor and its affiliates. Even if we are able to retain comparable management, whether internal or external, the integration of new management and their lack of familiarity with our investment objective may result in additional costs and time delays that may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted. As a business development company, we are prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our independent directors and, in some cases, the SEC. Any person that owns, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our outstanding voting securities is considered our affiliate for purposes of the 1940 Act. We are generally prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to an affiliate, absent the prior approval of our independent directors. The 1940 Act also prohibits certain joint transactions with an affiliate, which could include investments in the same portfolio company (whether at the same or different times), without prior approval of our independent directors. If a person acquires more than 25% of our voting securities, we are prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to that person or certain of that persons affiliates, or entering into prohibited joint transactions with those persons, absent the prior approval of the SEC. Similar restrictions limit our ability to transact business with our officers or directors or their affiliates. 35 Table of Contents We incur significant costs as a result of being a publicly traded company. As a publicly traded company, we incur legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with the periodic reporting requirements applicable to a company whose securities are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as well as additional corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and other rules implemented by the SEC. Terrorist attacks and other catastrophic events may disrupt the businesses in which we invest and harm our operations and our profitability. Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity or acts of war may significantly harm our results of operations and your investment. We cannot assure you that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the United States or United States businesses. Such attacks or armed conflicts in the United States or elsewhere may impact the businesses in which we invest directly or indirectly, by undermining economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere. In addition, because many of our portfolio companies operate and rely on network infrastructure and enterprise applications and internal technology systems for development, marketing, operational, support and other business activities, a disruption or failure of any or all of these systems in the event of a major telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, fire, earthquake, severe weather conditions or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in product development and loss of critical data and could otherwise disrupt their business operations. Losses resulting from terrorist attacks are generally uninsurable. Risks Related to our Investments We have not yet identified many of the potential investment opportunities for our portfolio. We have not yet identified many of the potential investment opportunities for our portfolio. Our future investments will be selected by our Advisor, subject to the approval of its investment committee. Our stockholders do not have input into our Advisors investment decisions. As a result, our stockholders are unable to evaluate any of our future portfolio company investments. These factors increase the uncertainty, and thus the risk, of investing in our shares of common stock. If our investments do not meet our performance expectations, you may not receive distributions. We intend to make distributions of income on a quarterly basis to our stockholders. We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions. See Regulation above. Also, restrictions and provisions in any existing or future credit facilities may limit our ability to make distributions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including failure to obtain, or possible loss of, the federal income tax benefits allowable to RICs. Most of our portfolio companies will need additional capital, which may not be readily available. Our portfolio companies typically require substantial additional financing to satisfy their continuing working capital and other capital requirements and service the interest and principal payments on our investments. We cannot predict the circumstances or market conditions under which our portfolio companies will seek additional capital. Each round of institutional equity financing is typically intended to provide a company with only enough capital to reach the next stage of development. It is possible that one or more of our portfolio companies will not be able to raise additional financing or may be able to do so only at a price or on terms that are unfavorable to the portfolio company, either of which would negatively impact our investment returns. Some of these companies may be unable to obtain sufficient financing from private investors, public capital markets or lenders thereby requiring these companies to cease or curtail business operations. Accordingly, investing in these types of companies generally entails a higher risk of loss than investing in companies that do not have significant incremental capital raising requirements. 36 Table of Contents Economic recessions or downturns could adversely affect our business and that of our portfolio companies which may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. General economic conditions may affect our activities and the operation and value of our portfolio companies. Economic slowdowns or recessions may result in a decrease of institutional equity investment, which would limit our lending opportunities. Furthermore, many of our portfolio companies may be susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to repay our loans during these periods. Therefore, our non-performing assets are likely to increase and the value of our portfolio is likely to decrease during these periods. Adverse economic conditions also may decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments. Economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in revenues, net income and assets. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. A portfolio companys failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its loans and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize the portfolio companys ability to meet its obligations under the loans that we hold. We may incur expenses to the extent necessary to recover our investment upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company. These events could harm our financial condition and operating results. Our investment strategy focuses on investments in development-stage companies in our Target Industries, which are subject to many risks, including volatility, intense competition, shortened product life cycles and periodic downturns, and are typically rated below investment grade. We intend to invest, under normal circumstances, most of the value of our total assets (including the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in development-stage companies, which may have relatively limited operating histories, in our Target Industries. Many of these companies may have narrow product lines and small market shares, compared to larger established publicly-owned firms, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors actions and market conditions, as well as general economic downturns. The revenues, income (or losses) and valuations of development-stage companies in our Target Industries can and often do fluctuate suddenly and dramatically. For these reasons, investments in our portfolio companies, if rated by one or more ratings agency, would typically be rated below investment grade, which refers to securities rated by ratings agencies below the four highest rating categories. These companies may also have more limited access to capital and higher funding costs. In addition, development-stage technology markets are generally characterized by abrupt business cycles and intense competition, and the competitive environment can change abruptly due to rapidly evolving technology. Therefore, our portfolio companies may face considerably more risk than companies in other industry sectors. Accordingly, these factors could impair their cash flow or result in other events, such as bankruptcy, which could limit their ability to repay their obligations to us and may materially adversely affect the return on, or the recovery of, our investments in these businesses. Because of rapid technological change, the average selling prices of products and some services provided by development-stage companies in our Target Industries have historically decreased over their productive lives. These decreases could adversely affect their operating results and cash flow, their ability to meet obligations under their debt securities and the value of their equity securities. This could, in turn, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any unrealized depreciation we experience on our loan portfolio may be an indication of future realized losses, which could reduce our income available for distribution. As a business development company, we are required to carry our investments at fair value which shall be the market value of our investments or, if no market value is ascertainable, at the fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to procedures approved by our board of directors in accordance with our valuation policy. We are not permitted to maintain a reserve for loan losses. Decreases in the fair values of our investments are recorded as unrealized depreciation. Any unrealized depreciation in our loan portfolio could be an indication of a portfolio 37 Table of Contents companys inability to meet its repayment obligations to us with respect to the affected loans. This could result in realized losses in the future and ultimately reduces our income available for distribution in future periods. If the assets securing the loans we make decrease in value, we may not have sufficient collateral to cover losses and may experience losses upon foreclosure. We believe our portfolio companies generally will be able to repay our loans from their available capital, from future capital-raising transactions or from cash flow from operations. However, to mitigate our credit risks, we typically take a security interest in all or a portion of the assets of our portfolio companies, including the equity interests of their subsidiaries. There is a risk that the collateral securing our loans may decrease in value over time, may be difficult to appraise or sell in a timely manner and may fluctuate in value based upon the business and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of the portfolio company to raise additional capital, and, in some circumstances, our lien could be subordinated to claims of other creditors. In addition, deterioration in a portfolio companys financial condition and prospects, including its inability to raise additional capital, may be accompanied by deterioration in the value of the collateral for the loan. Consequently, although such loan is secured, we may not receive principal and interest payments according to the loans terms and the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to recover our investment should we be forced to enforce our remedies. In addition, because we invest in development-stage companies in our Target Industries, a substantial portion of the assets securing our investment may be in the form of intellectual property, if any, inventory, equipment, cash and accounts receivables. Intellectual property, if any, which secures a loan could lose value if the companys rights to the intellectual property are challenged or if the companys license to the intellectual property is revoked or expires. In addition, in lieu of a security interest in the intellectual property we may sometimes obtain a security interest in all assets of the portfolio company other than intellectual property and also obtain a commitment by the portfolio company not to grant liens to any other creditor on the companys intellectual property. In these cases, we may have additional difficulty recovering our principal in the event of a foreclosure. Similarly, any equipment securing our loan may not provide us with the anticipated security if there are changes in technology or advances in new equipment that render the particular equipment obsolete or of limited value or if the company fails to adequately maintain or repair the equipment. Any one or more of the preceding factors could materially impair our ability to recover principal in a foreclosure. The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business, and if we need to sell any of our investments, we may not be able to do so at a favorable price. As a result, we may suffer losses. We plan to generally invest in loans with terms of up to four years and hold such investments until maturity, unless earlier prepaid, and we do not expect that our related holdings of equity securities will provide us with liquidity opportunities in the near-term. We expect to primarily invest in companies whose securities are not publicly-traded, and whose securities will be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities. The illiquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired. We may also face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a public portfolio company to the extent that we possess material non-public information regarding the portfolio company. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these investments. As a result, we do not expect to dispose of our investments in the near term. However, we may be required to do so in order to maintain our qualification as a business development company and as a RIC if we do not satisfy one or more of the applicable criteria under the respective regulatory frameworks. Because most of our investments are illiquid, we may be unable to dispose of them, in which case we could fail to qualify as a RIC and/or BDC, or we may not be able to dispose of them at favorable prices, and as a result, we may suffer losses. Our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies. We plan to invest primarily in loans issued by our portfolio companies. Some of our portfolio companies are permitted to have other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our loans in the portfolio company. By their terms, these debt instruments may provide that the holders thereof are entitled to receive payment of interest or principal on 38 Table of Contents or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments in respect of our loans. These debt instruments may prohibit the portfolio companies from paying interest on or repaying our investments in the event of, and during, the continuance of a default under the debt instruments. In addition, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any payment in respect of our investment. After repaying senior creditors, a portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with our loans, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy. There may be circumstances where our loans could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or we could be subject to lender liability claims. Even though certain of our investments are structured as senior loans, if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we actually provided managerial assistance to that portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might recharacterize our debt investment and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors. We may also be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by us with respect to a portfolio companys business, including in rendering significant managerial assistance, or instances where we exercise control over the portfolio company. An investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies, a dependence on the talents and efforts of only a few key portfolio company personnel and a greater vulnerability to economic downturns. We currently invest, and plan to invest, primarily in privately held companies. Generally, very little public information exists about these companies, and we are required to rely on the ability of our Advisor to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investing in these companies. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, we may not make a fully informed investment decision, and we may lose money on our investments. Also, privately held companies frequently have less diverse product lines and a smaller market presence than larger competitors. They are thus generally more vulnerable to economic downturns and may experience substantial variations in operating results. These factors could affect our investment returns. In addition, our success depends, in large part, upon the abilities of the key management personnel of our portfolio companies, who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our portfolio companies. Competition for qualified personnel is intense at any stage of a companys development. The loss of one or more key managers can hinder or delay a companys implementation of its business plan and harm its financial condition. Our portfolio companies may not be able to attract and retain qualified managers and personnel. Any inability to do so may negatively affect our investment returns. Prepayments of our debt investments by our portfolio companies could adversely impact our results of operations and reduce our return on equity. We are subject to the risk that the investments we make in our portfolio companies may be repaid prior to maturity. For example, most of our debt investments have, historically, been repaid prior to maturity by our portfolio companies. At the time of a liquidity event, such as a sale of the business, refinancing or public offering, many of our portfolio companies have availed themselves of the opportunity to repay our loans prior to maturity. Our investments generally allow for repayment at any time subject to certain penalties. When this occurs, we will generally reinvest these proceeds in temporary investments, pending their future investment in new portfolio companies. These temporary investments will typically have substantially lower yields than the debt being prepaid, and we could experience significant delays in reinvesting these amounts. Any future investment in a new portfolio company may also be at lower yields than the debt that was repaid. As a result, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our portfolio companies elects to prepay amounts owed to us. Additionally, prepayments could negatively impact our return on equity, which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock. 39 Table of Contents Our business and growth strategy could be adversely affected if government regulations, priorities and resources impacting the industries in which our portfolio companies operate change. Some of our portfolio companies operate in industries that are highly regulated by federal, state and/or local agencies. Changes in existing laws, rules or regulations, or judicial or administrative interpretations thereof, or new laws, rules or regulations could have an adverse impact on the business and industries of our portfolio companies. In addition, changes in government priorities or limitations on government resources could also adversely impact our portfolio companies. We are unable to predict whether any such changes in laws, rules or regulations will occur and, if they do occur, the impact of these changes on our portfolio companies and our investment returns. Our portfolio companies operating in the life science industry are subject to extensive government regulation and certain other risks particular to that industry. As part of our investment strategy, we have invested, and plan to invest in the future, in companies in the life science industry that are subject to extensive regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and to a lesser extent, other federal and state agencies. If any of these portfolio companies fail to comply with applicable regulations, they could be subject to significant penalties and claims that could materially and adversely affect their operations. Portfolio companies that produce medical devices or drugs are subject to the expense, delay and uncertainty of the regulatory approval process for their products and, even if approved, these products may not be accepted in the marketplace. In addition, new laws, regulations or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations might adversely affect a portfolio company in this industry. Portfolio companies in the life science industry may also have a limited number of suppliers of necessary components or a limited number of manufacturers for their products, and therefore face a risk of disruption to their manufacturing process if they are unable to find alternative suppliers when needed. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect the operations of a portfolio company in this industry and, in turn, impair our ability to timely collect principal and interest payments owed to us. If our portfolio companies are unable to commercialize their technologies, products, business concepts or services, the returns on our investments could be adversely affected. The value of our investments in our portfolio companies may decline if they are not able to commercialize their technology, products, business concepts or services. Additionally, although some of our portfolio companies may already have a commercially successful product or product line at the time of our investment, technology-related products and services often have a more limited market or life span than products in other industries. Thus, the ultimate success of these companies often depends on their ability to continually innovate in increasingly competitive markets. If they are unable to do so, our investment returns could be adversely affected and their ability to service their debt obligations to us over the life of the loan could be impaired. Our portfolio companies may be unable to successfully acquire or develop any new technologies and the intellectual property they currently hold may not remain viable. Even if our portfolio companies are able to develop commercially viable products, the market for new products and services is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Neither our portfolio companies nor we will have any control over the pace of technology development. Commercial success is difficult to predict, and the marketing efforts of our portfolio companies may not be successful. If our portfolio companies are unable to protect their intellectual property rights, our business and prospects could be harmed, and if portfolio companies are required to devote significant resources to protecting their intellectual property rights, the value of our investment could be reduced. Our future success and competitive position depends in part upon the ability of our portfolio companies to obtain, maintain and protect proprietary technology used in their products and services. The intellectual property held by our portfolio companies often represents a substantial portion of the collateral securing our investments and/or constitutes a significant portion of the portfolio companies value that may be available in a downside scenario to repay our loans. Our portfolio companies rely, in part, on patent, trade secret and trademark law to protect that technology, but competitors may misappropriate their intellectual property, and disputes as to ownership of intellectual property may arise. Portfolio companies may, from time to time, be required to institute litigation to enforce their patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, protect their trade secrets, 40 Table of Contents determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Similarly, if a portfolio company is found to infringe or misappropriate a third partys patent or other proprietary rights, it could be required to pay damages to the third party, alter its products or processes, obtain a license from the third party and/or cease activities utilizing the proprietary rights, including making or selling products utilizing the proprietary rights. Any of the foregoing events could negatively affect both the portfolio companys ability to service our debt investment and the value of any related debt and equity securities that we own, as well as any collateral securing our investment. We do not expect to control any of our portfolio companies. We do not control, or expect to control in the future, any of our portfolio companies, even though our debt agreements may contain certain restrictive covenants that limit the business and operations of our portfolio companies. We also do not maintain, or intend to maintain in the future, a control position to the extent we own equity interests in any portfolio company. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company in which we invest may make business decisions with which we disagree and the management of such company, as representatives of the holders of their common equity, may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests as debt investors. Due to the lack of liquidity of the investments that we typically hold in our portfolio companies, we may not be able to dispose of our investments in the event we disagree with the actions of a portfolio company and we may therefore, suffer a decrease in the value of our investments. Risks Related to our Common Stock We cannot assure you that the market price of shares of our common stock will not decline. Prior to our IPO, there was no public trading market for our common stock. We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade. Shares of closed-end management investment companies have in the past frequently traded at discounts to their net asset values and our common stock has been and may continue to be discounted in the market. This characteristic of closed-end management investment companies is separate and distinct from the risk that our net asset value per share may decline. We cannot predict whether shares of our common stock will trade above, at or below our net asset value. If our common stock trades below its net asset value, we will generally not be able to sell additional shares of our common stock to the public at its market price without first obtaining the approval of our stockholders (including our unaffiliated stockholders) and our independent directors. Subsequent sales in the public market of substantial amounts of our common stock issued to insiders or others may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. We and our executive officers and directors and certain other stockholders, including the selling stockholder in our initial public offering made pursuant to our Prospectus dated October 28, 2010, are subject to agreements with the underwriters of our initial public offering that restrict our and their ability to transfer our stock for a period of 180 days from October 28, 2010. Approximately one out of every six of our publicly issued shares outstanding is subject to such agreements. In the event that either (a) during the last 17 days of the 180-day restricted period, we issue an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to us occurs or (b) prior to the expiration of the 180-day restricted period, we announce that we will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the 180-day period, the lock-up restrictions will continue to apply until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release or the occurrence of the material news or material event. After the lock-up agreements expire, an aggregate of 1,305,124 additional shares of our common stock will be eligible for sale in the public market in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or the availability of such shares for sale, including by insiders, could adversely affect the prevailing market prices for our common stock. If this occurs and continues, our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities could be impaired should we desire to do so. 41 Table of Contents Our common stock price may be volatile and may decrease substantially. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and the liquidity of our common stock may be limited, in each case depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include the following:  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market or in the market for business development companies from time to time;  investor demand for our shares of common stock;  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of registered closed-end management investment companies, business development companies or other financial services companies;  our inability to raise capital, borrow money or deploy or invest our capital;  fluctuations in interest rates;  any shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts;  operating performance of companies comparable to us;  changes in regulatory policies or tax guidelines with respect to RICs, business development companies or SBICs;  not electing or losing RIC status;  actual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results;  changes in the value of our portfolio of investments;  changes in the value of our portfolio of investments;  changes in the value of our portfolio of investments;  general economic conditions, trends and other external factors;  departures of key personnel; or  loss of a major source of funding. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price, we may therefore be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources from our business. We currently invest a portion of our capital in high-quality short-term investments, which generate lower rates of return than those expected from investments made in accordance with our investment objective. We currently invest a portion of the net proceeds of our capital in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality short-term investments. These securities may earn yields substantially lower than the income that we anticipate receiving once these proceeds are fully invested in accordance with our investment objective. Investing in shares of our common stock may involve an above average degree of risk. The investments we make in accordance with our investment objective may result in a higher amount of risk, volatility or loss of principal than alternative investment options. Our investments in portfolio companies may be highly speculative and aggressive, and therefore, an investment in our common stock may not be suitable for investors with lower risk tolerance. 42 Table of Contents Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and other agreements and certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. The Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:  provide for a classified board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;  do not provide for cumulative voting;  provide that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;  limit the calling of special meetings of stockholders;  provide that our directors may be removed only for cause;  require supermajority voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws; and  require stockholders to provide advance notice of new business proposals and director nominations under specific procedures. These anti-takeover provisions may inhibit a change in control in circumstances that could give the holders of our common stock the opportunity to realize a premium over the market price of our common stock. Our Credit Facility also contains a covenant that prohibits us from merging or consolidating with any other person or selling all or substantially all of our assets without the prior written consent of WestLB. If we were to engage in such a transaction without such consent, WestLB could accelerate our repayment obligations under, and/or terminate, our Credit Facility. In addition, the SBA prohibits, without prior SBA approval, a change of control of an SBIC. A change of control is any event which would result in the transfer of power, direct or indirect, to direct the management and policies of an SBIC, including through ownership. To the extent that we receive a license for our SBIC subsidiary, this would prohibit a change of control of us without prior SBA approval. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None
