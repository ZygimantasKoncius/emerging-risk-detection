Risk FactorsWe face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses" in Item 1A. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we operate. Commodity Pricing and Risk Management Activities. Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil. Declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically. Historically, natural gas and crude oil prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. In particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our long-lived assets. Because our reserves are predominantly natural gas, changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results. The majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices. Generally, if the related commodity index declines, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. Therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control. However, management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of derivative financial instruments. Most recently, we have used financial instruments such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue. Under both arrangements, there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2012 and 2011 Compared We reported net income for 2012 of $131.7 million, or $0.63 per share, compared to net income for 2011 of $122.4 million, or $0.59 per share. The increase in net income was primarily due to an 46 Table of Contents increase in equivalent production and higher realized crude oil prices partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices and higher operating costs. Revenue, Price and Volume Variances Below is a discussion of revenue, price and volume variances.

(2)These prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements, which increased the price by $5.00 per Bbl in 2012 and by $1.01 per Bbl in 2011. Natural Gas Revenues The increase in Natural gas revenues of $136.7 million, excluding the impact of the unrealized losses discussed above, is primarily due to increased production, partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices. The increased production was primarily a result of higher production in the Marcellus Shale associated with our drilling program and expanded infrastructure, partially offset by the sale of certain oil and gas properties in the Rockies in the fourth quarter of 2011 and decreases in production primarily in Texas, Oklahoma and West Virginia due to a shift from natural gas to liquids drilling and normal production declines. Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues The increase in Crude oil and condensate revenues of $102.0 million is primarily due to increased production associated with our Eagle Ford Shale drilling program in south Texas and the Marmaton oil play in Oklahoma, coupled with higher realized oil prices. 47 Table of Contents Brokered Natural Gas Year Ended December 31, Variance Price and Volume Variances (In thousands) 2012 2011 Amount Percent Brokered Natural Gas Sales Sales price ($/Mcf) $ 3.57 $ 4.97 $ (1.40 ) (28)% $ (13,328 ) Volume brokered (Mmcf) x 9,527 x 10,303 (776 ) (8)% (3,857 ) Brokered natural gas (In thousands) $ 34,005 $ 51,190 $ (17,185 ) Brokered Natural Gas Purchases Purchase price ($/Mcf) $ 2.99 $ 4.25 $ (1.26 ) (30)% $ 12,034 Volume brokered (Mmcf) x 9,527 x 10,303 (776 ) (8)% 3,298 Brokered natural gas (In thousands) $ 28,502 $ 43,834 $ 15,332 Brokered natural gas margin (In thousands) $ 5,503 $ 7,356 $ (1,853 ) The decreased brokered natural gas margin of $1.9 million is primarily a result of a decrease in brokered volumes coupled with a decrease in sales price that outpaced the decrease in purchase price. Impact of Derivative Instruments on Operating Revenues The following table reflects the increase / (decrease) to operating revenues from the realized impact of cash settlements for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges and the net unrealized change in fair value of other financial derivative instruments: Year Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2012 2011 Cash Flow Hedges Natural gas $ 225,108 $ 84,937 Crude oil 11,218 1,403 Other Derivative Financial Instruments Natural gas basis swaps (494 ) (965 ) $ 235,832 $ 85,375 48 Table of Contents Operating and Other Expenses Year Ended December 31, Variance (In thousands) 2012 2011 Amount Percent Operating and Other Expenses Direct operations $ 118,243 $ 107,409 $ 10,834 10% Transportation and gathering 143,309 73,322 69,987 95% Brokered natural gas 28,502 43,834 (15,332 ) (35)% Taxes other than income 48,874 27,576 21,298 77% Exploration 37,476 36,447 1,029 3% Depreciation, depletion and amortization 451,405 343,141 108,264 32% General and administrative 121,239 104,667 16,572 16% Total operating expense $ 949,048 $ 736,396 $ 212,652 29% (Gain) / loss on sale of assets $ (50,635 ) $ (63,382 ) $ (12,747 ) (20)% Interest expense and other 68,293 71,663 (3,370 ) (5)% Income tax expense 106,110 112,779 (6,669 ) (6)% Total costs and expenses from operations increased by $212.7 million from 2011 to 2012. The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows: Direct operations increased $10.8 million largely due to increased operating costs primarily driven by increased production. Contributing to the increase are higher employee related and lease maintenance costs, partially offset by lower workover costs. Transportation and gathering increased by $70.0 million primarily due higher throughput due to an increase in production and higher transportation rates, coupled with the commencement of various transportation and gathering arrangements in late 2011 and throughout 2012, primarily in northeast Pennsylvania and south Texas. Brokered natural gas decreased by $15.3 million from 2011 to 2012. See the preceding table titled "Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost" for further analysis. Taxes other than income increased $21.3 million primarily due to additional costs associated with the passage of an "impact fee" in Pennsylvania on Marcellus Shale production that was imposed by state legislature in February 2012 and higher production tax expense due to fewer production tax refunds and credits received in 2012 compared to 2011. Exploration increased $1.0 million primarily due to an increase in exploration expense as the result of increased activity, partially offset by lower geophysical and geological costs due to fewer acquisitions and purchases of seismic data. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $108.3 million, with a $131.4 million increase due to higher equivalent production volumes partially offset by an $8.5 million decrease due to a lower DD&A rate. This increase was offset by a decrease in amortization of unproved properties of $14.4 million as a result of a decrease in amortization rates due to the success of our drilling programs in Pennsylvania and south Texas and the sale of certain Pearsall Shale undeveloped leaseholds in south Texas in the second quarter of 2012. 49 Table of Contents General and administrative increased by $16.6 million primarily due to $14.0 million higher pension expense associated with the termination of our qualified pension plan and the related settlement that occurred in the second quarter 2012, and higher legal costs and professional fees of $6.0 million. Also contributing to the increase was the accrual of $1.9 million associated with fines and penalties assessed by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue for certain alleged volume reporting matters (which we are currently disputing) related to properties we no longer own and a $2.2 million charitable contribution to fund the construction of a hospital in northeast Pennsylvania. These increases were partially offset by $6.3 million of lower stock-based compensation expense primarily associated with the mark-to-market of our liability-based performance awards due to changes in our stock price in 2012 compared to 2011. Gain / (Loss) on Sale of Assets During 2012, we recognized an aggregate gain of $50.6 million which includes a $67.0 million gain associated with the sale of certain of our Pearsall Shale undeveloped leaseholds in south Texas, partially offset by an $18.2 million loss on the sale of certain proved oil and gas properties located in south Texas. During the 2011, an aggregate gain of $63.4 million was recognized primarily due to the sale of certain undeveloped leaseholds in east Texas and the sale of other non-core assets. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense and other decreased by $3.4 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a decrease in the weighted-average effective interest rate on the credit facility, which decreased to approximately 3.0% during 2012 compared to approximately 4.1% during 2011, partially offset by a decrease in weighted-average borrowings under our credit facility based on weighted-average debt of $283.8 million in 2012 compared to weighted-average debt of $317.7 million in 2011. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense decreased by $6.7 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due a lower effective tax rate partially offset by increased pretax income. The effective tax rates for 2012 and 2011 were 44.6% and 48.0%, respectively. The effective tax rate was lower due to a decrease in the impact of our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes. 2011 and 2010 Compared We reported net income for 2011 of $122.4 million, or $0.59 per share, compared to net income of $103.4 million, or $0.50 per share, for 2010. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices and higher operating costs. 50 Table of Contents Revenue, Price and Volume Variances Below is a discussion of revenue, price and volume variances.

The increased production is primarily due to increased production associated with our Marcellus Shale drilling program in northeast Pennsylvania, partially offset by decreases in production primarily in east and south Texas due to normal production declines, the sale of certain oil and gas properties in the Rockies and a shift from natural gas to oil projects. Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues The increase in Crude Oil and Condensate revenues of $46.9 million is primarily due to increased production, partially offset by lower realized oil prices. The increase in production is primarily due to our drilling program in the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas, partially offset by lower production in east Texas due to decreased activity. 51 Table of Contents Brokered Natural Gas Year Ended December 31, Variance Price and Volume Variances (In thousands) 2011 2010 Amount Percent Brokered Natural Gas Sales Sales price ($/Mcf) $ 4.97 $ 5.41 $ (0.44 ) (8)% $ (4,533 ) Volume brokered (Mmcf) x 10,303 x 12,072 (1,769 ) (15)% (9,558 ) Brokered natural gas (In thousands) $ 51,190 $ 65,281 $ (14,091 ) Brokered Natural Gas Purchases Purchase price ($/Mcf) $ 4.25 $ 4.68 $ (0.43 ) (9)% $ 4,353 Volume brokered (Mmcf) x 10,303 x 12,072 (1,769 ) (15)% 8,279 Brokered natural gas (In thousands) $ 43,834 $ 56,466 $ 12,632 Brokered natural gas margin (In thousands) $ 7,356 $ 8,815 $ (1,459 ) The decreased brokered natural gas margin of $1.5 million is primarily a result of a decrease in brokered volumes coupled with a decrease in the sales price that slightly outpaced the decrease in purchase price. Impact of Derivative Instruments on Operating Revenues The following table reflects the increase / (decrease) to operating revenues from the realized impact of cash settlements for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges and the net unrealized change in fair value of other financial derivative instruments: Year Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2011 2010 Cash Flow Hedges Natural gas $ 84,937 $ 154,960 Crude oil 1,403 18,030 Other Derivative Financial Instruments Natural gas basis swaps (965 ) (226 ) $ 85,375 $ 172,764 52 Table of Contents Operating and Other Expenses Year Ended December 31, Variance (In thousands) 2011 2010 Amount Percent Operating and Other Expenses Direct operations $ 107,409 $ 99,642 $ 7,767 8% Transportation and gathering 73,322 19,069 54,253 285% Brokered natural gas 43,834 56,466 (12,632 ) (22)% Taxes other than income 27,576 37,894 (10,318 ) (27)% Exploration 36,447 42,725 (6,278 ) (15)% Depreciation, depletion and amortization 343,141 327,083 16,058 5% Impairment of oil and gas properties and other assets  40,903 (40,903 ) (100)% General and administrative 104,667 79,177 25,490 32% Total operating expense $ 736,396 $ 702,959 $ 33,437 5% (Gain) / loss on sale of assets $ (63,382 ) $ (106,294 ) $ (42,912 ) (40)% Interest expense and other 71,663 67,941 3,722 5% Income tax expense 112,779 95,112 17,667 19% Total costs and expenses from operations increased by $33.4 million from 2010 to 2011. The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows: Direct operations increased $7.8 million largely due to increased operating costs primarily driven by increased production. Contributing to the increase are higher workover and environmental and regulatory costs associated with the remediation of certain wells in northeast Pennsylvania as a result of the PaDEP consent order and settlement agreement. Offsetting these increases were lower lease maintenance, subsurface lease maintenance and plugging and abandonment costs in 2011 compared to 2010 coupled with lower compression expenses primarily due to the sale of our gathering system in northeast Pennsylvania in the fourth quarter of 2010. Transportation and gathering increased by $54.3 million primarily due to the commencement of various firm transportation and gathering arrangements in 2011, primarily in northeast Pennsylvania. Brokered natural gas decreased by $12.6 million from 2010 to 2011. See the preceding table titled "Brokered Natural Gas" for further analysis. Taxes other than income decreased $10.3 million due to decreased production taxes as a result of tax refunds and credits received in 2011 on qualifying wells, lower ad valorem tax expense due to lower natural gas prices and property values and lower franchise tax expense. Exploration decreased $6.3 million due to lower geological and geophysical costs primarily due to a reduction in the acquisition of seismic data, partially offset by higher dry hole costs in 2011 related to an exploratory dry hole in Montana. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased by $16.1 million, of which $29.8 million was due to increased depreciation and depletion from increased capital spending and higher equivalent production volumes offset by a lower DD&A rate and a $1.4 million increase in accretion of asset retirement obligations. The increase in depreciation and depletion was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of unproved properties of $15.1 million primarily due to a decrease in amortization rates due to a shift in our drilling and development activities. Impairment of oil and gas properties decreased by $40.9 million from 2011 to 2010 due to the impairment of two south Texas fields recognized as a result of commodity price declines and 53 Table of Contents limited activity and the impairment of drilling and service equipment in 2010. There were no impairments in 2011. General and administrative increased by $25.5 million primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $25.1 million primarily associated with the mark to market of the liability portion of our performance shares due to changes in our stock price in 2011 compared 2010. Higher incentive compensation and fringe benefits also contributed to the increase. These increases are partially offset by lower legal and professional costs associated with the PaDEP consent order and settlement agreement executed in 2010. Gain / (Loss) on Sale of Assets During 2011, we recognized a gain of $34.2 million from the sale of oil and gas properties in east Texas and an aggregate gain of $29.2 million related to the sale of various other non-core assets. During 2010, we recognized a gain of $49.3 million from the sale of our Pennsylvania gathering infrastructure, $40.7 million from the sale of our investment in Tourmaline and an aggregate gain of $16.3 million related to the sale of various other oil and gas properties and other assets during the year. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense and other increased by $3.7 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in the weighted-average effective interest rate on the credit facility, which increased to approximately 4.1% during the 2011 compared to approximately 3.8% during 2010, partially offset by a decrease in weighted-average borrowings under our credit facility based on average daily balances of $317.7 million during 2011 compared to average daily balances of $340.4 million during 2010. In addition, in December 2010, we issued $175 million aggregate principal amount of 5.58% weighted-average fixed rate notes, which increased interest expense recognized in 2011. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased by $17.7 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased pretax income and a slightly higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010 were 48.0% and 47.9%, respectively. The effective tax rate was slightly higher primarily due to an increase in our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes mainly due to a continued shift in our state apportionment factors to higher rate states, primarily Pennsylvania, as a result of our continued focus on development of our Marcellus Shale properties. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk Our primary market risk is exposure to natural gas and crude oil prices. Realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for crude oil and market prices for North American natural gas production. Commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictable. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity Our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets. A hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity. Our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices, but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the 54 Table of Contents hedges. Please read the discussion below as well as Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements. Periodically, we enter into commodity derivative instruments, including collar and swap agreements, to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks. All of our derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes. Under the collar agreements, if the index price rises above the ceiling price, we pay the counterparty. If the index price falls below the floor price, the counterparty pays us. Under the swap agreements, we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market-based index, such as the NYMEX gas and crude oil futures. As of December 31, 2012, we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Commodity and Derivative Type Weighted-Average Contract Price Volume Contract Period Net Unrealized Gain / (Loss) (In thousands) Natural gas collars $3.09 Floor / $4.12 Ceiling per Mcf 35.5 Bcf Jan. 2013 - Dec. 2013 $ (2,807 ) Natural gas collars $3.35 Floor / $4.01 Ceiling per Mcf 35.5 Bcf Jan. 2013 - Dec. 2013 (1,021 ) Natural gas collars $3.40 Floor / $4.12 Ceiling per Mcf 17.7 Bcf Jan. 2013 - Dec. 2013 287 Natural gas collars $3.60 Floor / $4.17 Ceiling per Mcf 17.7 Bcf Jan. 2013 - Dec. 2013 2,290 Natural gas collars $3.76 Floor / $4.16 Ceiling per Mcf 17.7 Bcf Jan. 2013 - Dec. 2013 5,765 Natural gas collars $3.86 Floor / $4.34 Ceiling per Mcf 17.7 Bcf Jan. 2013 - Dec. 2013 7,586 Natural gas collars $5.15 Floor / $6.20 Ceiling per Mcf 17.7 Bcf Jan. 2013 - Dec. 2013 29,090 Crude oil swaps $101.90 per Bbl 1,095 Mbbl Jan. 2013 - Dec. 2013 9,482 $ 50,672 The amounts set forth under the net unrealized gain / (loss) column in the table above represent our total unrealized derivative position at December 31, 2012 and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk was primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions, while our non-performance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks. During 2012, natural gas and crude oil swaps covered 96.0 Bcf, or 38%, and 1,709 Mbbl, or 76%, of natural gas and crude oil production at an average price of $5.22 per Mcf and $100.12 per Bbl, respectively. Natural gas basis swaps covered 17 Bcf, or 7%, of our natural gas production at an average price of $(0.25) per Mcf. Natural gas collars with a floor price of $3.60 per Mcf and a ceiling price of $4.17 per Mcf covered 3.0 Bcf, or 1%, of our natural gas production at an average price of $3.70 per Mcf. We are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil. However, the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity. Although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements, the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of non-performance by third parties are substantially smaller. We do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to non-performance by third parties. Our primary derivative contract counterparties are Bank of America, Bank of Montreal, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley. 55 Table of Contents Fair Market Value of Other Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of other financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties. The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of long-term debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay a third party to assume the debt, including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate. The credit spread is our default or repayment risk. The credit spread (premium or discount) is determined by comparing our fixed-rate notes and credit facility to new issuances (secured and unsecured) and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt. The fair value of all of the fixed-rate notes and the credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us. We use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt. The carrying amounts and fair values of long-term debt are as follows: December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 (In thousands) Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Long-term debt $ 1,087,000 $ 1,213,474 $ 950,000 $ 1,082,531 Current maturities (75,000 ) (77,175 )   Long-term debt, excluding current maturities $ 1,012,000 $ 1,136,299 $ 950,000 $ 1,082,531 56 Table of Contents ITEM 8.

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Houston, Texas February 28, 2013 58 Table of Contents CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET December 31, (In thousands, except share amounts) 2012 2011 ASSETS Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 30,736 $ 29,911 Accounts receivable, net 172,419 114,381 Income taxes receivable  1,388 Inventories 14,173 21,278 Derivative instruments 50,824 174,263 Other current assets 2,158 4,579 Total current assets 270,310 345,800 Properties and equipment, net (Successful efforts method) 4,310,977 3,934,584 Derivative instruments  21,249 Other assets 35,026 29,860 $ 4,616,313 $ 4,331,493 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities Accounts payable $ 312,480 $ 217,294 Current portion of long-term debt 75,000  Income taxes payable 1,667  Deferred income taxes 5,203 55,132 Accrued liabilities 49,789 70,918 Total current liabilities 444,139 343,344 Postretirement benefits 38,864 38,708 Long-term debt 1,012,000 950,000 Deferred income taxes 882,672 802,592 Asset retirement obligation 67,016 60,142 Other liabilities 40,175 31,939 Total liabilities 2,484,866 2,226,725 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders' equity Common stock: Authorized480,000,000 shares of $0.10 par value in 2012 and 240,000,000 shares of $0.10 par value in 2011 Issued210,429,731 shares and 209,019,458 shares in 2012 and 2011, respectively 21,043 20,902 Additional paid-in capital 716,609 724,377 Retained earnings 1,373,264 1,258,291 Accumulated other comprehensive income 23,880 104,547 Less treasury stock, at cost: 404,400 shares in 2012 and 2011, respectively (3,349 ) (3,349 ) Total stockholders' equity 2,131,447 2,104,768 $ 4,616,313 $ 4,331,493 The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. 59 Table of Contents CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, (In thousands, except per share amounts) 2012 2011 2010 OPERATING REVENUES Natural gas $ 933,640 $ 796,517 $ 713,646 Crude oil and condensate 227,933 125,972 79,091 Brokered natural gas 34,005 51,190 65,281 Other 8,968 6,185 5,086 1,204,546 979,864 863,104 OPERATING EXPENSES Direct operations 118,243 107,409 99,642 Transportation and gathering 143,309 73,322 19,069 Brokered natural gas cost 28,502 43,834 56,466 Taxes other than income 48,874 27,576 37,894 Exploration 37,476 36,447 42,725 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 451,405 343,141 327,083 Impairment of oil and gas properties and other assets   40,903 General and administrative 121,239 104,667 79,177 949,048 736,396 702,959 Gain/(loss) on sale of assets 50,635 63,382 106,294 INCOME FROM OPERATIONS 306,133 306,850 266,439 Interest expense and other 68,293 71,663 67,941 Income before income taxes 237,840 235,187 198,498 Income tax expense 106,110 112,779 95,112 NET INCOME $ 131,730 $ 122,408 $ 103,386 Earnings per share Basic $ 0.63 $ 0.59 $ 0.50 Diluted $ 0.62 $ 0.58 $ 0.49 Weighted-average common shares outstanding Basic 209,538 208,498 207,823 Diluted 210,993 210,761 210,390 Dividends per common share $ 0.08 $ 0.06 $ 0.06 The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. 60 Table of Contents CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Year Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2012 2011 2010 Net income $ 131,730 $ 122,408 $ 103,386 Other comprehensive income / (loss), net of taxes: Reclassification adjustment for settled hedge contracts(1) (144,456 ) (52,840 ) (107,256 ) Changes in fair value of hedge contracts(2) 53,815 163,704 45,878 Defined benefit pension and postretirement plans: Net gain / (loss)(3) 1,258 (13,814 ) 5,693 Plan termination and amendment(4)   506 Settlement(5)  3,380 2,493 Amortization of net obligation at transition(6)  387 392 Amortization of prior service cost(7) 134 640 355 Amortization of net loss(8) 8,582 6,718 5,788 Foreign currency translation adjustment(9)  55 32 Total other comprehensive income / (loss) (80,667 ) 108,230 (46,119 ) Comprehensive income / (loss) $ 51,063 $ 230,638 $ 57,267 (1)Net of income taxes of $91,870, $33,500 and $65,734 for the year ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Nature of Operations Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) are engaged in the development, exploitation, exploration, production and marketing of natural gas, crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas liquids exclusively within the continental United States. The Company also transports, stores, gathers and purchases natural gas for resale. The Company's exploration and development activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources, which are conducive to multi-well, repeatable drilling programs. The Company operates in one segment, natural gas and crude oil development, exploitation and exploration. The Company's oil and gas properties are managed as a whole rather than through discrete operating segments or business units. Operational information is tracked by geographic area; however, financial performance is assessed as a single enterprise and not on a geographic basis. Allocation of resources is made on a project basis across the Company's entire portfolio without regard to geographic areas. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries after eliminating all significant intercompany balances and transactions. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year statements to conform with current year presentation. These reclassifications have no impact on net income. On January 3, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 split of the Company's common stock in the form of a stock dividend. The stock dividend was distributed on January 25, 2012 to shareholders of record as of January 17, 2012. All common stock accounts and per share data have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the 2-for-1 split of the Company's common stock. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-11, "Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities." The amendments in this update require enhanced disclosures around financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (1) offset in accordance with either Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 210-20-45 or ASC 815-10-45 or (2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with either ASC 210-20-45 or ASC 815-10-45. An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. The amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. This guidance will primarily impact the Company's disclosures associated with its commodity derivatives. The Company does not expect this guidance to have any impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01, "Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities." The amendments in this update clarify that the scope of ASU 2011-11 applies to derivatives accounted for in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with ASC 210-20-45 or ASC 815-10-45 or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. This guidance will primarily impact the Company's disclosures 64 Table of Contents 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) associated with its commodity derivatives. The Company does not expect this guidance to have any impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less and deposits in money market funds that are readily convertible to cash to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents were primarily concentrated in one financial institution at December 31, 2012 and 2011. The Company periodically assesses the financial condition of its financial institutions and considers any possible credit risk to be minimal. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables that the Company determines to be uncollectible based on the specific identification method. Inventories Inventories are comprised of natural gas in storage, tubular goods and well equipment and pipeline imbalances. Natural gas in storage, tubular goods and well equipment balances are carried at the lower of average cost or market. Natural gas gathering and pipeline operations normally include imbalance arrangements with the pipeline. The volumes of natural gas due to or from the Company under imbalance arrangements are recorded at actual selling or purchase prices, as the case may be, and are adjusted monthly to market prices. Equity Method Investment The Company accounts for its investment in entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control, using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company records its proportionate share of net earnings, declared dividends and partnership distributions based on the most recently available financial statements of the investee. The Company also evaluates its equity method investments for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is an other-than-temporary decline in the value of the investment. Properties and Equipment The Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities. Under this method, acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. Exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole drilling costs, are expensed. Development costs, including the costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when incurred pending the determination of whether a well has found proved reserves. The determination is based on a process which relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, and engineering data. If a well is determined to be successful, the capitalized drilling costs will be reclassified as part of the cost of the well. If a well is determined to be unsuccessful, the capitalized drilling costs will be charged to exploration expense in the period the determination is made. If an exploratory well requires a major capital expenditure before production 65 Table of Contents 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) can begin, the cost of drilling the exploratory well will continue to be carried as an asset pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found only as long as: (i) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well if the required capital expenditure is made and (ii) drilling of an additional exploratory well is under way or firmly planned for the near future. If drilling in the area is not under way or firmly planned, or if the well has not found a commercially producible quantity of reserves, the exploratory well is assumed to be impaired and its costs are charged to exploration expense. Development costs of proved oil and gas properties, including estimated dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs and acquisition costs, are depreciated and depleted on a field basis by the units-of-production method using proved developed and proved reserves, respectively. Properties related to gathering and pipeline systems and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives ranging from 10 to 25 years. Generally pipeline and transmission systems are depreciated over 12 to 25 years, gathering and compression equipment is depreciated over 10 years and storage equipment and facilities are depreciated over 10 to 16 years. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 25 to 40 years. Certain other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 3 to 10 years. Costs of retired, sold or abandoned properties that make up a part of an amortization base (partial field) are charged to accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization if the units-of-production rate is not significantly affected. Accordingly, a gain or loss, if any, is recognized only when a group of proved properties (entire field) that make up the amortization base has been retired, abandoned or sold. The Company evaluates its proved oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company compares expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. If the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on estimates of future natural gas and crude oil prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves (also potentially including risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves from time to time) are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. The discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and crude oil. Unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to the Company's undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience, the Company's expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives. Average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, amortization associated with the Company's unproved properties was $18.1 million, $32.5 million and $47.6 million, respectively, and is included in Depreciation, depletion, and amortization in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Asset Retirement Obligations The Company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement 66 Table of Contents 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. Subsequently, the asset retirement cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the asset's useful life. The majority of the asset retirement obligations recorded by the Company relate to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells. However, liabilities are also recorded for meter stations, pipelines, processing plants and compressors. At December 31, 2012, there were no assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations. Additional retirement obligations increase the liability associated with new oil and gas wells and other facilities as these obligations are incurred. Accretion expense is included in Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Risk Management Activities From time to time, the Company enters into derivative contracts, such as swaps or collars, as a hedging strategy to manage commodity price risk associated with its production or other contractual commitments. All hedge transactions are subject to the Company's risk management policy which does not permit speculative trading activities. Gains or losses on these hedging activities are generally recognized over the period that its production or other underlying commitment is hedged as an offset to the specific hedged item. Cash flows related to any recognized gains or losses associated with these hedges are reported as cash flows from operations. If a hedge is terminated prior to expected maturity, gains or losses are deferred and included in income in the same period that the underlying production or other contractual commitment is delivered. Unrealized gains or losses associated with any derivative contract not considered a hedge are recognized currently in the results of operations. When the designated item associated with a derivative instrument matures or is sold, extinguished or terminated, derivative gains or losses are recognized as part of the gain or loss on the sale or settlement of the underlying item. For example, in the case of natural gas price hedges, the gain or loss is reflected in natural gas revenue. When a derivative instrument is associated with an anticipated transaction that is no longer expected to occur or if the hedge is no longer effective, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in the results of operations to the extent the market value changes in the derivative have not been offset by the effects of the price changes on the hedged item since the inception of the hedge. Revenue Recognition Producer Gas Imbalances The Company applies the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenue. Under this method, revenues are recognized based on the actual volume of natural gas sold to purchasers. Natural gas production operations may include joint owners who take more or less than the production volumes entitled to them on certain properties. Production volume is monitored to minimize these natural gas imbalances. A natural gas imbalance liability is recorded at the actual price realized upon the gas sale in Accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet if the Company's excess takes of natural gas exceed its estimated remaining proved developed reserves for these properties. Brokered Natural Gas Margin Revenues and expenses related to brokering natural gas are reported gross as part of operating revenues and operating expenses in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The Company realizes brokered margin as a result of buying and selling natural gas utilizing separate purchase and sale transactions, typically with separate counterparties, whereby the Company and/or the counterparty 67 Table of Contents 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) takes title to the natural gas purchased or sold. The Company realized $5.5 million, $7.4 million and $8.8 million of brokered natural gas margin in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Income Taxes The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rate in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year of the enacted rate change. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. The Company is required to make judgments, including estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that the Company has taken. The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position. The amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect management's estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties. The Company recognizes accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions in Interest expense and other and accrued penalties related to such positions in General and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the fair value method of accounting. Under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date and remeasured each reporting period for liability-classified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. To calculate fair value, the Company uses either a binomial or Black-Scholes valuation model depending on the specific provisions of the award. Stock-based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in General and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The tax benefit for stock-based compensation is included as both a cash inflow from financing activities and a cash outflow from operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company recognizes a tax benefit only to the extent it reduces the Company's income taxes payable. The Company did not recognize a tax benefit for stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Environmental Matters Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate, depending on their future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and that do not have future economic benefit are expensed. Liabilities related to future costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental assessments and/or remediation activities are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Any insurance recoveries are recorded as assets when received. 68 Table of Contents 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Credit and Concentration Risk Although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas price agreements, the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of non-performance by third parties are substantially smaller. The Company does not anticipate any material impact on its financial results due to non-performance by the third parties. In 2012, three customers accounted for approximately 18%, 12% and 10%, respectively, of the Company's total sales. In 2011, the Company did not have any one customer account for greater than 10% of the Company's total sales. In 2010, one customer accounted for approximately 11%, of the Company's total sales. Use of Estimates In preparing financial statements, the Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates pertain to proved natural gas and crude oil reserves and related cash flow estimates used in impairment tests of oil and gas properties, natural gas and crude oil revenues and expenses, current values of derivative instruments, as well as estimates of expenses related to legal, environmental and other contingencies, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset retirement obligations, pension and postretirement obligations, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
