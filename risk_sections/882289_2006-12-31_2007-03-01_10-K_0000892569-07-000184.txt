RISK FACTORS Apria has identified the following important factors, among others, that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements the company may make from time to time. If any of these risks, or others, actually occurs, Aprias business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. Collectibility of Accounts ReceivableAprias failure to maintain its controls and processes over billing and collecting or the deterioration of the financial condition of its payors could have a significant negative impact on its results of operations and financial condition. The collection of accounts receivable is one of Aprias most significant challenges and requires constant focus and involvement by management and ongoing enhancements to information systems and billing center operating procedures. Further, some of Aprias payors and/or patients may experience financial difficulties, or may otherwise not pay accounts receivable when due, resulting in increased write-offs. There can be no assurance that Apria will be able to maintain its controls and processes over billing or its current levels of collectibility and days sales outstanding in future periods. If Apria is unable to properly bill and collect its accounts receivable, its results will be adversely affected. Operating Systems and ControlsAprias failure to successfully implement computer and other system modifications designed to maximize productivity could ultimately have a significant negative impact on its results of operations and financial condition. Aprias management has identified a number of areas throughout its operations where it intends to modify the current processes or systems in order to attain a higher level of productivity. The ultimate cost savings expected from the successful design and implementation of such initiatives will be necessary to help offset the impact of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement reductions and continued downward pressure on pricing. Aprias failure to successfully implement its planned system modifications and other productivity improvements could have a significant impact on its operations and financial condition. Further, the implementation of these system changes could have a disruptive effect on related transaction processing and operations. Medicare/Medicaid Reimbursement RatesContinued reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on Aprias results of operations and financial condition. Medicare Reimbursement Reductions. There are a number of provisions contained within recent legislation and proposed regulations that adversely affect or may adversely affect reimbursement for products and services provided by Apria. For example, in December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, also referred to as the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, became law. The MMA and related rules issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, implemented reimbursement reductions for a number of products and services provided by Apria and established a proposed competitive bidding program for Medicare Part B. Further, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, or DRA, was signed into law in February 2006. Once fully implemented, the DRA and related rules issued by CMS would result in reduced reimbursement rates for certain durable medical equipment, including home oxygen equipment and services provided by Apria, a reduced period for rental revenue, and potential increased costs associated with replacement of certain patient-owned equipment. In addition to these laws, certain other proposed legislative and regulatory activities may affect reimbursement policies for other items and services provided by Apria. These recently enacted reductions and pending proposed reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on Aprias net revenues, net income, cash flow and capital resources. Medicaid Reimbursement Reductions. For a number of years, some states began adopting alternative pricing methodologies for certain drugs and biologicals under the Medicaid program. In a number of states, the changes reduced the level of reimbursement received by Apria without a corresponding offset or increase to compensate for the service costs incurred. In several of those states, Apria elected to stop accepting new Medicaid patient referrals for the affected drugs and biologicals. Further, some states are considering other reductions in Medicaid reimbursement as they work through their respective budget processes. Apria cannot estimate the ultimate impact of all legislated and contemplated Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement changes or provide assurance to investors that additional reimbursement reductions will not be made or will not have an adverse effect on the companys operations and financial condition. See Business  Government Regulation  Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement. 15 Table of Contents Government Regulation; Healthcare ReformNon-compliance with laws and regulations applicable to Aprias business and future changes in those laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on Apria. Apria is subject to stringent laws and regulations at both the federal and state levels, requiring compliance with burdensome and complex billing, substantiation and record-keeping requirements. Financial relationships between Apria and physicians and other referral sources are also subject to strict limitations. In addition, strict licensing and safety requirements apply to the provision of services, pharmaceuticals and equipment. Violations of these laws and regulations could subject Apria to severe fines, facility shutdowns and possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Government officials and the public will continue to debate healthcare reform. Recently, proposed initiatives in certain states (California, Massachusetts) and potential new federal or state public policy changes to cover the uninsured could ultimately also effect payment rates to providers or initiate new provider fees or taxes. Changes in public policy, healthcare law, new interpretations of existing laws, or changes in payment methodology may have a significant effect on Aprias business and results of operations. Economic and Political Events, International Conflicts and Natural DisastersSignificant global or regional developments that are out of the companys control could have a material adverse effect on Apria. Further reductions in reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid programs could result if there is a significant change in government spending priorities. The costs of military and security activities or prolonged relief efforts in response to a natural disaster could increase pressure to reduce government expenditures for other purposes, including government-funded programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Such further reimbursement reductions could have a material adverse effect on Aprias business and results of operations. Pricing PressuresApria believes that continued pressure to reduce healthcare costs could have a material adverse effect on the company. The current market continues to exert pressure on healthcare companies to reduce healthcare costs, resulting in reduced margins for home healthcare providers such as Apria. Larger group purchasing organizations and supplier groups exert additional pricing pressure on home healthcare providers. These include managed care organizations, which control an increasing portion of the healthcare economy. Apria has a number of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other parties, although no individual arrangement accounted for more than 9% of Aprias net revenues in 2006. The segment of the healthcare market in which Apria operates is highly competitive. In each of its service lines, there are a number of national providers and numerous regional and local providers. Other types of healthcare providers, including industrial gas manufacturers, individual hospitals and hospital systems, home health agencies and health maintenance organizations have entered, and may continue to enter the market to compete with Aprias various service lines. Some of these competitors have access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources than Apria and may be better positioned to compete in the market. This may increase pricing pressure and limit Aprias ability to maintain or increase its market share. Acquisitions  Aprias strategic plan may include the acquisition of other companies, which involves a number of risks. Historically, Aprias growth has depended in part upon the acquisition of other companies. Aprias strategic plan may or may not continue to include the acquisition of other businesses. Apria faces the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire such businesses, or the capital expenditures needed to develop such businesses. Acquisitions such as these involve a number of other risks, including:  difficulties related to integrating a previously separate businesses into the company;  diversion of managements attention from day-to-day operations;  assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including unforeseen or contingent liabilities, or liabilities in excess of the amounts the company estimates;  failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements;  dilution of existing stockholders due to the issuance of equity securities, utilization of cash reserves, or incurrence of debt in order to fund the acquisitions;  potentially substantial transaction costs associated with acquisitions;  difficulties related to assimilating the products, personnel and systems of an acquired business, including distribution and other operational capabilities; and  difficulties in applying Aprias internal controls to an acquired business. While Apria generally pursues acquisitions of companies that are related to its principal business, the company may also pursue acquisitions of companies that are ancillary to the companys core business in the future which could exacerbate the risks described above. If the company cannot effectively execute its acquisition strategy, its future growth may suffer and its results of operations could be harmed. Accordingly, Apria may be unable to identify, consummate and integrate future acquisitions successfully or operate acquired businesses profitably. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
