D. Risk Factors An investment in Tasekos common shares is highly speculative and subject to a number of risks. Only those persons who can bear the risk of the entire loss of their investment should participate. An investor should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information that Taseko files with the Securities and Exchange Commission and with Canadian securities regulators before investing in its common shares. The risks described below are not the only ones faced. Additional risks that Taseko is aware of or that Taseko currently believes are immaterial may become important factors that affect Tasekos business and financial condition. If any of the following risks occur, or if others occur, Tasekos business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. Estimates of Reserves, Mineral Deposits and Production Costs. Although ore reserve and mineral resource figures released by the Company have been carefully prepared and reviewed by the Company or - 14 - its independent mining consultants, these amounts are estimates only and no assurance can be given that any particular level of recovery of copper and molybdenum from ore reserves will in fact be realized. Estimates of reserves, mineral resources and production costs can also be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, environmental regulations, extreme weather, environmental factors, unforeseen technical difficulties, unusual or unexpected geological formations and work interruptions. In addition, the grade of ore ultimately mined may differ from that indicated by drilling results. Short term factors such as the need for orderly development of ore bodies or the processing of new or different grades, may also have an adverse effect on mining operations and consequently on the results of operations. Material changes in ore reserves, grades, stripping ratios or recovery rates may affect the economic viability of the Gibraltar mine. Reserves should not be interpreted as assurances of mine life or of the profitability of current or future operations. The Companys Prosperity and Harmony projects have large tonnage, low grade mineralization, which at current metals prices and other economic considerations cannot be classified as "ore". Production Estimates From time to time, the Company prepares estimates of future production for the Gibraltar mine. The Company cannot give any assurance that it will achieve these production estimates. The failure of the Company to achieve its production estimates could have a material adverse effect on its future cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. These production estimates are dependent on, among other things, the accuracy of mineral reserve calculations and estimates, the validity and accuracy of assumptions used relating to ore grades and recovery rates, ground conditions and physical characteristics of ore, including (but not limited to) rock hardness and the presence or absence of specific metallurgical characteristics and the accuracy of estimated rates and costs of mining and processing. The Company's actual production may vary from its estimates for a variety of reasons, including, actual ore mined varying from estimates of grade, tonnage, dilution and metallurgical and other characteristics; short-term operating factors such as the need for sequential development of ore bodies and the processing of new or different ore grades from those planned; mine failures, slope failures or equipment failures; industrial accidents; uncontrollable natural phenomena; unusual or unexpected geological conditions; changes in power costs and potential power shortages; shortages of principal supplies needed for operation, including explosives, fuels, necessary chemical reagents, water, equipment parts and lubricants; labor shortages or strikes; civil disobedience and protests; and restrictions or regulations imposed by government agencies or other changes in the regulatory environments. Such occurrences could result in interruptions in production, injury or death to persons, damage to property of the Company or others, monetary losses and legal liabilities. These factors may cause the Company to cease production. The Company does not have the benefit of recent actual experience in verifying its estimates, and there is a great likelihood that actual production results will vary from its estimates. It is not unusual in startup mining operations to experience unexpected circumstances during the startup phases. Depending on the price of copper, the Company may determine that it is impractical to continue commercial production at the Gibraltar mine. Mine Development. The Company's ability to sustain or increase its current levels of copper and molybdenum production is dependent upon the successful identification of additional reserves at the Gibraltar mine. If the Company is unable to develop new ore bodies, it will not be able to sustain present production levels beyond the current planned life of the Gibraltar mine. Reduced production could have a material adverse impact on future cash flows, results of operations and financial condition of the Company. Metal prices. The mining industry in general is highly competitive and there is no assurance that, even after commercial quantities of mineral resources are developed and full production achieved, a profitable market will exist for the sale of same. Factors beyond the control of the Company affect the marketability of any metals produced. No assurance may be given that metal prices will remain stable. Significant price fluctuations over short periods of time may be generated by numerous factors beyond the control of - 15 - the Company, including domestic and international economic and political trends, expectations of inflation, currency exchange fluctuations, interest rates, global or regional consumption patterns, speculative activities and increased production due to improved mining and production methods. The effect of these factors on the price of minerals and therefore the economic viability of any of the Gibraltar mine or any of the Company's other projects cannot accurately be predicted. Metal prices are volatile and have, in the recent past and for extended periods, been well below the level needed for the Gibraltar mine to operate at a profit. Additional Funding Requirements. Taseko will need metal sales from its Gibraltar mine in excess of costs and/or new equity capital or other funding annually in order to fund minimum operations, and exploration and development activities on its other properties. Failing that, it may cease to be economically viable. Tasekos Prosperity and Harmony Properties Contain No Known Reserves of Ore. Although there are known bodies of mineralization on Prosperity and Harmony Properties (see Item 4D), there are currently no known reserves or body of commercially viable ore and the Prosperity and Harmony Properties must be considered as exploration prospects only. Extensive additional exploration work is required before Taseko can ascertain if any mineralization may be economic. Exploration for minerals is a speculative venture necessarily involving substantial risk. If the expenditures Taseko makes on these properties do not result in discoveries of commercial quantities of ore, the value of exploration and acquisition expenditures will be totally lost and the value of Taseko stock resale negatively impacted. Risks of Development, Construction and Mining Operations and Uninsured Risks. The Company's ability to meet production, timing and cost estimates for the Gibraltar mine cannot be assured. Technical considerations, delays in obtaining necessary governmental approvals, or the inability to obtain necessary financing could cause a material adverse effect on the financial performance of the Company. Mining is subject to a variety of risks such as cave-ins and other accidents, flooding, environmental hazards, the discharge of toxic chemicals and other hazards. Such occurrences may delay production, increase production costs or result in liability. The Company has insurance in amounts that it considers adequate to protect itself from certain risks of mining operations. However, the Company may become subject to liability for hazards which it cannot or has chosen not to insure itself against. Labour Negotiations. A significant portion of the Company's employees are unionized. In the event that, from time to time, labor agreements are not concluded with these employees labor actions could occur, including strikes and/or lockouts. Consequently this could cause disruptions in operations. Taseko Has a Limited History of Earnings Taseko has a history of many years of losses. For the first time Taseko had earnings, in 2005. Taseko may never be profitable again. Taseko has paid no dividends on its shares since incorporation and does not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. A failure to continue to achieve profitability may negatively impact on Tasekos share value. Significant Potential Equity Dilution and End of Lock-ups. At March 30, 2006, Taseko had 111,518,327 common shares and 7,942,700 share purchase options and 10,809,482 warrants outstanding. The resale of outstanding shares from the exercise of dilutive securities could have a depressing effect on the market for Tasekos shares. At March 30, 2006, dilutive securities represented approximately 16.8% of Tasekos currently issued shares. Certain of these dilutive securities are exercisable at prices below current market price and, accordingly, will result in dilution to existing shareholders if exercised. Further, there is a risk of dilution to existing shareholders as a result of the potential conversion of (a) the Boliden convertible debentures, and (b) the Gibraltar tracking preferred shares. - 16 - Exploration is a Risky Business. The exploration for mineral deposits involves significant financial and other risks over an extended period of time, which even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Factors beyond Tasekos control will affect the marketability of any substances discovered. Metal prices have fluctuated widely in recent years. Even if exploration at Prosperity and Harmony is successful (and a mine deemed warranted), mining requires huge capital investment, long capital recovery periods and it is difficult to suspend operations pending a recovery of prices. Risk of Adverse Government Policies. Government regulations relating to mineral rights tenure, permission to disturb wilderness areas and the right to operate and export minerals can adversely affect Tasekos Harmony and Prosperity projects. Taseko may not be able to obtain all necessary licenses and permits that may be required to carry out exploration at those projects. Environmental concerns in general continue to be a significant challenge for Taseko as they are for all exploration companies. Any changes in regulations or shift in political attitude are beyond the control of Taseko and may adversely affect its business. Environmental Risks. Unexpected environmental damage from spills, accidents and severe acts of nature such as earthquakes are risks, which may not be fully insurable, and, if catastrophic, could mean the total loss of shareholders equity. Volatility of Tasekos Shares Could Cause Investor Loss. The market price of a publicly traded stock, especially a resource issuer like Taseko, is affected by many variables in addition to those directly related to exploration successes or failures. Such factors include the general condition of market for resource stocks, the strength of the economy generally, the availability and attractiveness of alternative investments, and the breadth of the public market for the stock. The effect of these and other factors on the market price of the common shares on the TSX and AMEX suggests Tasekos shares will continue to be volatile. Therefore, investors could suffer significant losses if Tasekos shares are depressed or illiquid when an investor seeks liquidity and needs to sell Taseko shares. Valid Title to Mining Claims and Leases. Taseko holds the title to the mining claims and leases of its Gibraltar mine, Prosperity Copper-Gold Property and Harmony Gold Property. Tasekos ownership of these mining claims should not be construed as a guarantee that title to such interests will not be challenged or impugned. The mining claims may be subject to prior unregistered agreements or transfers or native land claims, and title may also be affected by undetected defects. If Taseko does not have valid title to its mining claims and leases, then it may lose the rights to continue mining, exploration and development of these properties. Risk of Losing the Services of Senior Management Executives. Taseko relies on the services of Russell Hallbauer, who is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and other members of its management team to carry out its plan of operations for the Gibraltar mine and its other mineral property interests. Tasekos success is dependent upon the performance of key personnel working in management, supervisory and administrative capacities, or as consultants. The loss of the services of senior management or key personnel may result in Taseko being required to identify and engage qualified management personnel who are capable of managing Tasekos business activities. Mr. Hallbauer and other members of Tasekos management team are seconded from Hunter Dickinson Inc., a related party by virtue of common directors, and do not have a direct employment contract with Taseko. If Taseko was to lose the services of Mr. Hallbauer or other members of its management team, Tasekos plan of operations for the Gibraltar mine or its mineral property interests may be affected and its operating expenses may be increased. Risk of Losing the Services of Ledcor. Taseko relies on the services provided by Ledcor CMI Ltd. (“Ledcor”) under an Operating Agreement to operate the Gibraltar mine. Ledcor, as Operator, has - 17 - primary responsibility for carrying out mining and milling activities as well as recruitment of personnel and maintenance of the equipment and facilities. Taseko’s success depends to a significant extent on the performance and continued service of Ledcor in operating the Gibraltar mine. If Taseko lost the services of Ledcor, Taseko would not be able to operate the Gibraltar mine and generate revenues until another Operator could be engaged. Tasekos Directors, Most Officers and Staff are only Part-Time. Most of Tasekos directors and officers serve as officers and or directors of other resource exploration companies and, as such, are engaged in and will continue to be engaged in the search for additional resource opportunities on behalf of such other companies. In particular, the success of Taseko and its ability to continue to carry on operations is dependent partly upon its ability to retain the services of its senior technical and management personnel. (See Item 7(B)(a)) Management May Be Subject To Conflicts of Interest Due to Affiliation With Other Resource Companies. As most of Tasekos directors and officers serve as officers and or directors of other resource exploration companies which are themselves engaged in the search for additional opportunities, situations may arise where these directors and officers are presented with or identify resource exploration opportunities and may be or perceived to be in competition with Taseko for exploration opportunities. Such potential conflicts, if any arise, will be dealt with in accordance with the relevant provisions of British Columbia corporate and common law. Tasekos directors and officers expect that participation in exploration prospects offered to the directors will be allocated between the various companies that they serve on the basis of prudent business judgement and the relative financial abilities and needs of the companies to participate. In addition, many of Tasekos officers and directors have a financial interest in other resource issuers to which they serve as management and hence may never be financially disinterested in the outcomes of these potential conflict of interest situations. This situation may require that shareholders favorably consider ratification of directors decisions where financial conflicts arise resulting in uncertainty with respect to completion of such matters. Unsuccessful Resolution of Arbitration with Glencore. Taseko is currently in dispute with Glencore Ltd. (Glencore), the sole purchaser of copper concentrates produced by the Gibraltar mine pursuant to the terms of a written contract (Contract), concerning the interpretation of the Contract. To December 31, 2005, Glencore has withheld approximately US$3.3 million from invoices rendered by Gibraltar and is claiming repayment of a further US$0.5 million, on the basis of its interpretation of the Contract. Glencore asserts that the Contract provides that the price to be paid for the concentrates should be reduced by a deduction referred to as "price participation". Gibraltar asserts that the Contract does not provide for any such deduction. The dispute is set for arbitration in June 2006. While Taseko believes in the merits of its position and case, there can be no certainty of the ultimate outcome of the arbitration. An unsuccessful resolution of the arbitration may result in Taseko foregoing the amounts currently withheld by Glencore and further future price participation deductions. Tasekos Management May Not Be Subject to United States Legal Process. As Canadian citizens and residents, certain of Tasekos directors and officers may not subject themselves to United States legal proceedings, so that recovery on judgments issued by United States courts may be difficult or impossible. While reciprocal enforcement of judgment legislation exists between Canada and the United States, Tasekos insiders may have defenses available to avoid in Canada the effect of United States judgments under Canadian law, making enforcement difficult or impossible. Tasekos management may not have any personal assets available in the United States to satisfy judgments of United States courts. Therefore, Taseko shareholders in the United States may have to avail themselves of remedies under Canadian corporate and securities laws for perceived oppression, breach of fiduciary duty and like legal complaints. Canadian law may not provide for remedies equivalent to those available under United States law. - 18 - Ultimate Reclamation Costs May Exceed Amounts Accrued. The Company's operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, under various federal, provincial and local laws, which regulate air and water quality, hazardous waste management and environmental rehabilitation and reclamation. The Company's mining and related activities impact the environment, including land, habitat, streams and environment near the Gibraltar mine. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain, government permits and approvals may adversely impact the Company's operations. Further, the regulatory environment in which the Company operates could change in ways that may substantially increase costs to achieve compliance. These increased costs may have a material adverse effect on our profitability. The Company has accrued for the expected costs to comply with these environmental laws and regulations relating to the Company's obligation to reclaim areas disturbed by its mining activities. The Company has estimated these liabilities at $49.4 million as at September 30, 2005 on an undiscounted basis. However, the ultimate amount of such reclamation costs may in the future exceed these estimates due to influences beyond the Company's control, including, but not limited to, changing legislation or unidentified rehabilitation costs. The closure of mining operations, without sufficient working capital to discharge rehabilitation liabilities as they come due, or unacceptable damage to the environment, including pollution or environmental degradation, may expose the Company to litigation and significant liabilities. Exchange Rate Risk. The Company is subject to currency exchange rate risk. The prices of copper and molybdenum oxide are denominated in United States dollars and, accordingly, the Companys revenues will be received in United States dollars. The Companys expenses are almost entirely paid for in Canadian dollars, which has recently shown strength against the United States dollar. The further strengthening in the Canadian dollar, if it continues, will negatively impact the profitability of the Companys mining operations. - 19 -
