ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS MULTI-FAMILY, COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE AND CONSTRUCTION LOAN ORIGINATIONS HAVE INCREASED, INCREASING THE RISK THAT SOME OF OUR LOANS WILL NOT BE PAID. We have expanded our multi-family, commercial real estate and construction lending during the previous five years. Multi-family lending has increased as a percentage of our total loan portfolio from 12.9% at September 30, 2001 to 23.5% at September 30, 2005. Commercial real estate lending has increased as a percentage of our total loan portfolio from 15.0% at September 30, 2001 to 36.4% at September 30, 2005. Construction lending has increased as a percentage of our total loan portfolio from less than 1.0% at September 30, 2001 to 10.3% at September 30, 2005. Multi-family, commercial real estate loans and construction loans generally expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by one- to four-family real estate. At September 30, 2005, we had $3.5 million representing three loans in non-accrual status compared to $13,000 in non-accrual status at September 30, 2004. In addition, our multi-family, commercial real estate and construction loan portfolio is not as seasoned as the loan portfolio of some of our competitors. Should the local real estate market or economy weaken, we may begin to experience higher levels of non-performing loans. PERSONS WHO OWN OUR STOCK OWN A MINORITY OF BROOKLYN FEDERAL BANCORP, INC.'S COMMON STOCK AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE VOTING CONTROL OVER MOST MATTERS PUT TO A VOTE OF STOCKHOLDERS. Public stockholders own a minority of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. As a result, stockholders other than BFS Bancorp, MHC will not be able to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of stockholders. BFS Bancorp, MHC owns a majority of the Company's common stock and, through its board of directors, is able to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of stockholders. The same directors and officers who manage the Company and the Bank also manage BFS Bancorp, MHC. The only matters as to which stockholders other than BFS Bancorp, MHC 31 will be able to exercise voting control include any proposal to implement a recognition and retention stock plan or stock option plan within one year of the offering. In addition, BFS Bancorp, MHC may exercise its voting control to prevent a sale or merger transaction in which stockholders could receive a premium for their shares. OUR STOCK VALUE MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY FEDERAL REGULATIONS RESTRICTING TAKEOVERS AND OUR MUTUAL HOLDING COMPANY STRUCTURE. FEDERAL REGULATIONS RESTRICTING TAKEOVERS. For three years following the offering, Office of Thrift Supervision regulations prohibit any person from acquiring or offering to acquire more than 10% of our common stock without the prior written approval of the Office of Thrift Supervision. Moreover, current Office of Thrift Supervision policy prohibits the acquisition of a mutual holding company subsidiary by any person or entity other than a mutual holding company or a mutual institution. See "Business - Regulation and Supervision" for a discussion of applicable Office of Thrift Supervision Regulations regarding acquisitions. THE MUTUAL HOLDING COMPANY STRUCTURE MAY IMPEDE TAKEOVERS. BFS Bancorp, MHC, as the majority stockholder of the Company, is able to control the outcome of virtually all matters presented to stockholders for their approval, including a proposal to acquire the Company. Accordingly, BFS Bancorp, MHC may prevent the sale of control or merger of the Company or its subsidiaries even if such a transaction were favored by a majority of the public stockholders of the Company THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROVISIONS IN OUR CHARTER AND BYLAWS MAY PREVENT OR IMPEDE THE HOLDERS OF A MINORITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK FROM OBTAINING REPRESENTATION ON OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. Provisions in our charter and bylaws may prevent or impede holders of a minority of our common stock from obtaining representation on our board of directors. For example, our board of directors is divided into three staggered classes. A staggered board makes it more difficult for stockholders to change a majority of the directors because it generally takes at least two annual elections of directors for this to occur. Second, our charter provides that there will not be cumulative voting by stockholders for the election of our directors which means that BFS Bancorp, MHC, as the holder of a majority of the shares eligible to be voted at a meeting of stockholders, may elect all of our directors to be elected at that meeting. Third, our bylaws contain procedures and timetables for a stockholder wanting to make a nomination for the election of directors or a proposal for new business at a meeting of stockholders, the effect of which may be to give our management time to solicit its own proxies in an attempt to defeat any dissident slate of nominations if management thinks it is in the best interests of stockholders generally. AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES IS EXPECTED TO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS. Our earnings largely depend on our net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as mortgage loans and investment securities, and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The rates we earn on our assets are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. We, like many savings institutions, have liabilities that generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets or no contractual maturities, such as savings and money market deposits. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility, because market interest rates change over time. In addition, short-term and long-term interest rates do not necessarily change at the same time or at the same rate. 32 In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income earned on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on our liabilities. We are vulnerable to volatility in our earnings as a result of an increase in interest rates because the majority of our interest-earning assets are long-term, fixed rate assets. In an increasing interest rate environment, our cost of funds is expected to increase more rapidly than the interest earned on our loan portfolio and securities portfolio because our primary source of funds is deposits with generally shorter maturities than the maturities on our loans and investment securities. This could cause our net interest rate spread to compress because the increase in interest income we would earn on our securities and loan portfolios may be less than the increase in the interest expense we would pay on our deposits and borrowings. In addition, the expected duration of our mortgage-backed securities may increase during a rising interest rate environment, thereby lengthening the period during which they would reprice at higher rates. In a period of decreasing interest rates, prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities generally will increase as borrowers refinance their debt in order to reduce their borrowing costs. In a decreasing rate environment we are generally not able to reinvest the proceeds of loan and securities prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. A decreasing interest rate environment would result in a decrease in rates we pay on deposits and borrowings, but the decrease in the cost of our funds may not be as great as the decrease in the yields on our mortgage-backed securities and loan portfolios. This could cause a narrowing of our net interest rate spread and could cause a decrease in our earnings. We are further exposed to interest rate risk due to the large portion of our total deposits that can reprice at any time. The Bank monitors its interest rate sensitivity through the use of an asset/liability management model which estimates the change in its net portfolio value (defined as the current market value of assets, less the current market value of liabilities, plus or minus the current value of off-balance sheet items) in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. Our net portfolio value analysis, as calculated by the Office of Thrift Supervision using information as of September 30, 2005, showed that in the event of an immediate and permanent 2.0% increase in interest rates, our net portfolio value would be expected to decrease by 8%. STRONG COMPETITION WITHIN OUR MARKET AREA MAY LIMIT OUR GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Most of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition our competition recently has been offering loans with lower fixed rates and loans on more attractive terms than the Bank has been willing to offer. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. The greater resources and broader range of deposit and loan products offered by our competition may limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets and profitability. IF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, PARTICULARLY IN THE METROPOLITAN NEW YORK AREA, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS BORROWERS' ABILITY TO REPAY LOANS DECLINES AND THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL SECURING OUR LOANS DECREASES. Our financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, particularly in the metropolitan New York area, including decreases in real estate values, changes in interest rates which may cause a decrease in interest rate spreads, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government and other significant external events. At September 30, 2005, loans secured by real estate represented nearly all of our total loans, with 33 substantially all such loans being made in the New York metropolitan area. Decreases in local real estate values would adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans. Adverse changes in the economy also may have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings. IF OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER ACTUAL LOAN LOSSES, OUR EARNINGS COULD DECREASE. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. Material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY REGULATED ENVIRONMENT AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS. We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of Thrift Supervision, our chartering authority, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as insurer of deposits. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a financial institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution's allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, may have a material impact on our operations. ITEM 1B.
