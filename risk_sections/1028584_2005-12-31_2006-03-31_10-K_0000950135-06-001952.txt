Item 1A. Risk Factors Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results Our disclosure and analysis in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on managements plans and assumptions. From time to time, we may also provide forward-looking statements in other materials that we release to the public as well as oral forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements discuss our strategy, expected future financial position, results of operations, cash flows, financing plans, intellectual property, competitive position, and plans and objectives of management. We often use words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, plan, believe, will, should, might and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Additionally, forward-looking statements include those relating to future actions, prospective products, future performance, financing needs, liquidity, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates and the outcome of contingencies, and financial results. We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected by our forward-looking statements. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. Also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses. These are important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. 13 Table of Contents Our operating results will vary from period to period. In addition, we have experienced losses in the past and may never achieve consistent profitability. Our operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. We had net income of $44.2 million (which included a $46.3 million net gain from the sale of the Medical Division) for the year ended December 31, 2005, and a net loss of $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Although we had net income of $8.0 million and $24.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had consistently experienced net losses prior to that. Our net loss was $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and $78.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. On a continuing operations basis, we had losses of $2.0 million, $26.5 million and $10.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, and income of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Our operating results have been and/or may be influenced significantly by factors such as:  release of new products, product upgrades and services, and the rate of adoption of these products and services by new and existing customers;  timing, cost and success or failure of our new product and service introductions and upgrade releases;  length of sales and delivery cycles;  size and timing of orders for our products and services;  changes in the mix of products and/or services sold;  availability of specified computer hardware for resale;  deferral and/or realization of deferred software license and system revenues according to contract terms;  interpretations of accounting regulations, principles or concepts that are or may be considered relevant to our business arrangements and practices;  changes in customer purchasing patterns;  changing economic, political and regulatory conditions, particularly with respect to the IT-spending environment;  competition, including alternative product and service offerings, and price pressure;  customer attrition;  timing of, and charges or costs associated with, mergers, acquisitions or other strategic events or transactions, completed or not completed;  timing, cost and level of advertising and promotional programs;  changes of accounting estimates and assumptions used to prepare the prior periods financial statements and accompanying notes, and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (e.g., our valuation of assets and estimation of liabilities); and  uncertainties concerning threatened, pending and new litigation against us, including related professional services fees. Quarterly and annual revenues and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of the signing of license agreements and product deliveries during each quarter, which are very difficult to forecast. A significant portion of our quarterly sales of software product licenses and computer hardware is concluded in the last month of the fiscal quarter, generally with a concentration of our quarterly revenues earned in the final ten business days of that month. Also, our projections for revenues and operating results include significant sales of new product and service offerings, including our new image management systems, Vision Series PACS, our radiology information system, Vision Series RIS, and our combination offering AMICAS Office Solutions, which may not be realized. Due to these and other factors, our revenues and 14 Table of Contents operating results are very difficult to forecast. A major portion of our costs and expenses, such as personnel and facilities, is of a fixed nature and, accordingly, a shortfall or decline in quarterly and/or annual revenues typically results in lower profitability or losses. As a result, comparison of our period-to-period financial performance is not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance. Due to the many variables in forecasting our revenues and operating results, it is likely that our results for any particular reporting period will not meet our expectations or the expectations of public market analysts or investors. Failure to attain these expectations would likely cause the price of our common stock to decline. Our future success is dependent in large part on the success of our current products. In the first quarter of 2005, we sold our Medical Division, which represented 63% and 69% of our total revenues in 2004 and 2003, respectively. We have devoted substantial resources to the development and marketing of our current products. We believe that our future financial performance will be dependent in large part on the success of our ability to market our Vision Series suite of products, related products and service offerings. We may fail to realize the long-term financial benefits that we anticipate will result from our acquisition of Amicas PACS. Our expectations with regard to the long-term financial benefits that we anticipate will result from our acquisition of Amicas PACS are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including:  our ability to retain Amicas PACS key personnel. In particular, the loss of these employees would compromise the value of the Amicas PACS client base and/or its software products and technologies;  our ability to integrate the RIS and PACS products as may be, and/or to the extent, required by the marketplace, including our ability to deliver the related professional services; the integrity of the intellectual property of Amicas PACS; and  continued compliance with all government laws, rules and regulations for all applicable products. If our new products, including product upgrades, and services do not achieve sufficient market acceptance, our business, financial condition, cash flows, revenues, and operating results will suffer. The success of our business will depend in large part on the market acceptance of:  new products and services including AMICAS Office Solutions; and  enhancements to our existing products, support and services including Vision Series Financials. There can be no assurance that our customers will accept any of these products, product upgrades, support or services. In addition, there can be no assurance that any pricing strategy that we implement for any of our new products, product upgrades, or services will be economically viable or acceptable to our target markets. Failure to achieve significant penetration in our target markets with respect to any of our new products, product upgrades, or services could have a material adverse effect on our business. Achieving market acceptance for our new products, product upgrades and services is likely to require substantial marketing and service efforts and the expenditure of significant funds to create awareness and demand by participants in the healthcare industry. In addition, deployment of new or newly integrated products or product upgrades may require the use of additional resources for training our existing sales force and customer service personnel and for hiring and training additional sales and customer service personnel. There can be no assurance that the revenue opportunities for our new products, product upgrades and services will justify the amounts that we spend for their development, marketing and rollout. If we are unable to sell our new and next-generation software products to healthcare providers that are in the market for healthcare information and/or image management systems, such inability will likely have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. If new software sales and services do not materialize, our maintenance and electronic data interchange, or EDI, 15 Table of Contents services revenues can be expected to decrease over time due to the combined effects of attrition of existing customers and a shortfall in new client additions. Our business could suffer if our products and services contain errors, experience failures, result in loss of our customers data or do not meet customer expectations. The products and services that we offer are inherently complex. Despite testing and quality control, we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in prior, current or future versions, or enhancements of our products and services. We also cannot assure you that our products and services will not experience partial or complete failure, especially with respect to our new product or service offerings. It is also possible that as a result of any of these errors and/or failures, our customers may suffer loss of data. The loss of business, medical, diagnostic, or patient data or the loss of the ability to process data for any length of time may be a significant problem for some of our customers who have time-sensitive or mission-critical practices. We could face breach of warranty or other claims or additional development costs if our software contains errors, if our customers suffer loss of data or are unable to process their data, if our products and/or services experience failures, do not perform in accordance with their documentation, or do not meet the expectations that our customers have for them. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against them could be expensive and time-consuming and could divert managements attention away from our operations. In addition, negative publicity caused by these events may delay or reduce market acceptance of our products and services, including unrelated products and services. Such errors, failures or claims could materially adversely affect our business, revenues, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. Our competitive position could be significantly harmed if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights from third-party challenges. Our ability to compete depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect the intellectual property rights related to our software applications. Most of our software technology is not patented and existing copyright laws offer only limited practical protection. Our practice is to require all new employees to sign a confidentiality agreement and most of our employees have done so. However, not all existing employees have signed confidentiality agreements. We cannot assure you that the legal protections that we rely on will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology. Further, we may need to bring lawsuits or pursue other legal or administrative proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights. Generally, lawsuits and proceedings of this type, even if successful, are costly, time consuming and could divert our personnel and other resources away from our business, which could harm our business. Moreover, these protections do not prevent independent third-party development of competitive technology or services. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology. Monitoring use of our technology is difficult, and we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Intellectual property infringement claims against us could be costly to defend and could divert our managements attention away from our business. As the number of software products and services in our target markets increases and as the functionality of these products and services overlaps, we are increasingly subject to the threat of intellectual property infringement claims. Any infringement claims alleged against us, regardless of their merit, will be time-consuming and expensive to defend. Infringement claims will also divert our managements attention and resources and could also cause delays in the delivery of our applications to our customers. Settlement of any infringement claims could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on terms that are costly or cost-prohibitive. If a claim of infringement against us was successful and if we were unable to license the 16 Table of Contents infringing or similar technology or redesign our products and services to avoid infringement, our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations will be harmed. We may undertake additional acquisitions, which may involve significant uncertainties and may increase costs and divert management resources from our core business activities, or we may fail to realize anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. We may undertake additional acquisitions if we identify companies with desirable applications, products, services, businesses or technologies businesses or technologies. We may not achieve any of the anticipated synergies and other benefits that we expected to realize from these acquisitions. In addition, software companies depend heavily on their employees to maintain the quality of their software offerings and related customer services. If we are unable to retain acquired companies personnel or integrate them into our operations, the value of the acquired applications, products, services, distribution capabilities, business, technology, and/or customer base could be compromised. The amount and timing of the expected benefits of any acquisition are also subject to other significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include;  our ability to cross-sell products and services to customers with which we have established relationships and those with which the acquired business had established relationships;  diversion of our managements attention from our existing business;  potential conflicts in customer and supplier relationships;  our ability to coordinate organizations that are geographically diverse and may have different business cultures;  dilution to existing stockholders if we issue equity securities in connection with acquisitions;  assumption of liabilities or other obligations in connection with the acquisition; and  compliance with regulatory requirements. Further, our profitability may also suffer because of acquisition-related costs and/or amortization or impairment of intangible assets. Technology solutions may change faster than we are able to update our technologies, which could cause a loss of customers and have a negative impact on our revenues. The information management technology market in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, emerging competition and the frequent introduction of new services, software and other products. Our success depends partly on our ability to:  develop new or enhance existing products and services to meet the changing needs of our customers and the marketplace in a timely and cost-effective way; and  respond effectively to technological changes, new product offerings, product enhancements and new services of our competitors. We cannot be sure that we will be able to accomplish these goals. Our development of new and enhanced products and services may take longer than originally expected, require more testing than originally anticipated and require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources. In addition, there can be no assurance that the products and/or services we develop or license will be able to compete with the alternatives available to our customers. Our competitors may develop products or technologies that are better or more attractive than our products or technologies, or that may render our products or technologies obsolete. If we do not succeed in adapting our products, technology and services or developing new products, technologies and services, our business could be harmed. 17 Table of Contents Our inability to renew, or make material modifications to, agreements with our third party product and service providers could lead to a loss of customers and have a negative impact on our revenues. Some of our customers demand the ability to acquire a variety of products from one provider. Some of these products are not owned or developed by us. Through agreements with third parties we currently resell the desired hardware, software and services to these customers. However, in the event these agreements are not renewed or are renewed on less favorable terms, we could lose sales to competitors who market the desired products to these customers or recognize less revenue. If we do not succeed in maintaining our relationships with our third party providers, our business could be harmed. The nature of our products and services exposes us to product liability claims that may not be adequately covered by insurance or contractual indemnification. As a product and service provider in the healthcare industry, we operate under the continual threat of product liability claims being brought against us. Errors or malfunctions with respect to our products or services could result in product liability claims. In addition, certain agreements require us to indemnify and hold others harmless against certain matters. Although we believe that we carry adequate insurance coverage against product liability claims, we cannot assure you that claims in excess of our insurance coverage will not arise. In addition, our insurance policies must be renewed annually. Although we have been able to obtain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost in the past, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost. In many instances, agreements which we enter into contain provisions requiring the other party to the agreement to indemnify us against certain liabilities. However, any indemnification of this type is limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party. If the contractual indemnification rights available under such agreements are not adequate, or inapplicable to the product liability claims that may be brought against us, then, to the extent not covered by our insurance, our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We may be subject to claims resulting from the activities of our strategic partners. We rely on third parties to provide certain services and products critical to our business. For example, we use national clearinghouses in the processing of insurance claims and we outsource some of our hardware maintenance services and the printing and delivery of patient billings for our customers. We also sell third party products, several of which manipulate clinical data and information. We also have relationships with certain third parties where these third parties serve as sales channels through which we generate a portion of our revenues. Due to these third-party relationships, we could be subject to claims as a result of the activities, products, or services of these third-party service providers even though we were not directly involved in the circumstances leading to those claims. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, defending against and investigating these claims could be expensive and time-consuming, divert personnel and other resources from our business and result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. We are subject to government regulation and legal uncertainties, compliance with which could have a material adverse effect on our business. HIPAA Federal regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business. We have been, and may continue to be, required to expend additional resources to comply with regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The total extent and amount of resources to be expended is not yet known. Because some of these regulations are relatively new, there is uncertainty as to how they will be interpreted and enforced. Although we have made, and will continue to make, a good faith effort to ensure that we comply with, and that our go-forward products enable compliance with, applicable HIPAA requirements, we may not be able to conform all of our operations and products to such requirements in a timely manner, or at all. The 18 Table of Contents failure to do so could subject us to penalties and damages, as well as civil liability and criminal sanctions to the extent we are a business associate of a covered entity or regulated directly as a covered entity. In addition, any delay in developing or failure to develop products and/or deliver services that would enable HIPAA compliance for our current and prospective customers could put us at a significant disadvantage in the marketplace. Accordingly, our business, and the sale of our products and services, could be materially harmed by failures with respect to our implementation of HIPAA regulations. Other E-Commerce Regulations We may be subject to additional federal and state statutes and regulations in connection with offering services and products via the Internet. On an increasingly frequent basis, federal and state legislators are proposing laws and regulations that apply to Internet commerce and communications. Areas being affected by these regulations include user privacy, pricing, content, taxation, copyright protection, distribution, and quality of products and services. To the extent that our products and services are subject to these laws and regulations, the sale of our products and services could be harmed. FDA The Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices under the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as well as the 1990 Safe Medical Devices Act, and the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997. Certain computer applications and software are generally subject to regulation as medical devices, requiring registration with the FDA, application of detailed record-keeping and manufacturing standards, and FDA approval or clearance prior to marketing when such products are intended to be used in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Our PACS product is subject to FDA regulation. If the FDA were to decide that any of our other products and services should be subject to FDA regulation or, if in the future we were to expand our application and service offerings into areas that may subject us to further FDA regulation, the costs of complying with FDA requirements would most likely be substantial. Application of the approval or clearance requirements would create delays in marketing, and the FDA could require supplemental filings or object to certain of these products. In addition, we are subject to periodic FDA inspections and there can be no assurances that we will not be required to undertake specific actions to further comply with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, its amendments and any other applicable regulatory requirements. The FDA has available several enforcement tools, including product recalls, seizures, injunctions, civil fines and/or criminal prosecutions. FDA compliance efforts with regard to our PACS product are time consuming and very significant and any failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. State and federal laws relating to confidentiality of patient medical records could limit our customers ability to use our services and expose us to liability. The confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which records may be released are already subject to substantial governmental regulation. Although compliance with these laws and regulations is principally the responsibility of the healthcare provider, under these current laws and regulations patient confidentiality rights are evolving rapidly. A breach of any privacy rights of a customer and/or patient of a customer by one of our employees could subject us to significant liability. In addition to the obligations being imposed at the state level, there is also legislation governing the dissemination of medical information at the federal level. The federal regulations may require holders of this information to implement security measures, which could entail substantial expenditures on our part. Adoption of these types of legislation or other changes to state or federal laws could materially affect or restrict the ability of healthcare providers to submit information from patient records using our products and services. These kinds of restrictions would likely decrease the value of our applications to our customers, which could materially harm our business. 19 Table of Contents Changes in the regulatory and economic environment in the healthcare industry could cause us to lose revenue and incur substantial costs to comply with new regulations. The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. These factors affect the purchasing practices and operations of healthcare organizations. Changes in current healthcare financing and reimbursement systems could require us to make unplanned enhancements of applications or services, or result in delays or cancellations of orders or in the revocation of endorsement of our services by our strategic partners and others. Changes in the federal reimbursement regulations have been made, and federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to further reform or amend the U.S. healthcare system. These programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare, lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate. Healthcare industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions, including investments in our applications and services. As the cost of healthcare continues to rise, the government and other payers may make adjustments to their reimbursement for certain healthcare services and/or may make certain requirements of certain healthcare service provider organizations and businesses such that monies available for investment in image and information management products and services may decrease. While we believe that the pressure on such healthcare organizations to operate as efficiently and effectively as possible should drive the need for AMICAS products and services, certain changes in reimbursement may have the opposite effect. Any significant reduction in reimbursement puts at risk our customers and prospects ability and inclination to pay for our products and services. Regulations that require our customers and prospects to invest and spend their monies in other areas puts at risk their ability and inclination to pay for our products and services as well. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, signed into law on February 8, 2006, is an example of a planned change to reimbursement that may have a negative impact on our target markets ability and inclination to acquire our products and services. Larger and smaller regional competitors could cause us to lower our prices or to lose customers. Our principal competitors include both national and regional practice management and clinical systems vendors. Until recently, larger, national vendors have targeted primarily large healthcare providers. We believe that the larger, national vendors may broaden their markets to include both small and large healthcare providers. In addition, we compete with national and regional providers of computerized billing, insurance processing and record management services to healthcare practices. As the market for our products and services expands, additional competitors are likely to enter this market. We believe that the primary competitive factors in our markets are:  product features and functionality;  customer service, support and satisfaction;  price;  ongoing product enhancements; and  vendor reputation and stability. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, increased competition from current and potential competitors, many of which have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than us. Such competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than us. Also, certain current and potential competitors have greater name recognition or more extensive customer bases that could be leveraged, thereby gaining market share to our detriment. We expect additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter into the practice management and clinical software markets and as new products and technologies are introduced. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which would materially adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. 20 Table of Contents Current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, thereby increasing their abilities to address the needs of our existing and prospective customers. Further competitive pressures, such as those resulting from competitors discounting of their products, may require us to reduce the price of our software and complementary products, which would materially adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and our failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We depend on partners/suppliers for delivery of electronic data interchange (e.g., insurance claims processing and invoice printing services), commonly referred to as EDI, hardware maintenance services, third-party software or software or hardware components of our offerings, and sales lead generation. Any failure, inability or unwillingness of these suppliers to perform these services or provide their products could negatively impact customer satisfaction and revenues. We use various third-party suppliers to provide our customers with EDI transactions and on-site hardware maintenance. EDI revenues would be particularly vulnerable to a supplier failure because EDI revenues are earned on a daily basis. We rely on numerous third-party products that are made part of our software offerings and/or that we resell. Although other vendors are available in the marketplace to provide these products and services, it would take time to switch suppliers. If these suppliers were unable or unwilling to perform such services, provide their products or if the quality of these services or products declined, it could have a negative impact on customer satisfaction and result in a decrease in our revenues, cash flows and operating results. Our systems may be vulnerable to security breaches and viruses. The success of our strategy to offer our EDI services and Internet solutions depends on the confidence of our customers in our ability to securely transmit confidential information. Our EDI services and Internet solutions rely on encryption, authentication and other security technology licensed from third parties to achieve secure transmission of confidential information. We may not be able to stop unauthorized attempts to gain access to or disrupt the transmission of communications by our customers. Some of our customers have had their use of our software significantly impacted by computer viruses. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate confidential user information or interrupt our operations and those of our customers. In addition, our EDI and internet solutions may be vulnerable to viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions. Any failure to provide secure electronic communication services could result in a lack of trust by our customers, causing them to seek out other vendors, and/or damage our reputation in the market, making it difficult to obtain new customers. If the marketplace demands subscription pricing and/or application service provider, or ASP, delivered offerings, our revenues may be adversely impacted. We currently derive substantially all of our revenues from traditional software license, maintenance and service fees, as well as from the resale of computer hardware. Today, customers pay an initial license fee for the use of our products, in addition to a periodic maintenance fee. If the marketplace demands subscription pricing and/or ASP-delivered offerings, we may be forced to adjust our strategy accordingly, by offering a higher percentage of our products and services through these means. Shifting to subscription pricing and/or ASP-delivered offerings could materially adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows and quarterly and annual revenues and results of operations, as our revenues would initially decrease substantially. We cannot assure you that the marketplace will not embrace subscription pricing and/or ASP-delivered offerings. Our growth could be limited if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel. We believe that our success depends largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial and sales personnel to develop, sell and implement our products and services. Individuals with the information technology, managerial and selling skills we need to further develop, sell and implement our 21 Table of Contents products and services are in short supply and competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense. We may not be able to hire the necessary personnel to implement our business strategy, or we may need to pay higher compensation for employees than we currently expect. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in attracting and retaining the personnel we need to continue to grow and to implement our business strategy. In addition, we depend on the performance of our executive officers and other key employees. The loss of any member of our senior management team could negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy. We may be subject to product related liability lawsuits. Our software and third party software and hardware provided by us are used by healthcare providers in providing care to patients. Although no product liability lawsuits have been brought against us to date related to the use of these products and services, such lawsuits may be made against us in the future. We strive to maintain product liability insurance coverage in an amount that we believe is adequate; such coverage may not be adequate or such coverage may not continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. A successful lawsuit brought against us, which is uninsured or underinsured, could materially harm our business and financial condition. We may be exposed to credit risks of our customers. We recorded revenues of $52.8 million in 2005, and we bill substantial amounts to many of our customers. A deterioration of the credit worthiness of any of our customers could impact our ability to collect revenue or provide future services, which could negatively impact the results of our operations. At December 31, 2005, no one customer represented more than 10% of our accounts receivable. If any of our significant customers were unable to pay us in a timely fashion, or if we were to experience significant credit losses in excess of our reserves, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition would be seriously harmed. Our future success depends on our ability to successfully develop new products and adapt to new technology change. To remain competitive, we will need to develop new products, evolve existing ones, and adapt to technology change. Technical developments, customer requirements, programming languages and industry standards change frequently in our markets. As a result, success in current markets and new markets will depend upon our ability to enhance current products, develop and introduce new products that meet customer needs, keep pace with technology changes, respond to competitive products, and achieve market acceptance. Product development requires substantial investments for research, refinement and testing. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make necessary product development investments. We may experience difficulties that will delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or implementation of new or enhanced products. Inability to introduce or implement new or enhanced products in a timely manner would adversely affect future financial performance. Our products are complex and may contain errors. Errors in products will require us to ship corrected products to customers. Errors in products could cause the loss of or delay in market acceptance or sales and revenue, the diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation, and increased service and warranty costs which would have an adverse effect on financial performance.
