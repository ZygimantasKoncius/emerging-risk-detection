Item 1A. Risk Factors There are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our global operations that involve the design, manufacturing and sale of products for highly demanding applications. The risks and uncertainties associated with our business could adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition. The following discussion, along with discussions elsewhere in this report, outlines the risks and uncertainties that we believe are the most material to our business. Operating internationally carries risks which could negatively affect our financial performance. We have sales and manufacturing operations throughout the world, with the heaviest concentrations in North America, Europe and Asia. Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks of doing business internationally that could harm our business, including:  political and military events,  legal and regulatory requirements, including import, export and defense regulations,  tariffs and trade barriers,  potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations,  credit risk of local Customers and distributors,  difficulties in protecting intellectual property, and  local economic, political and social conditions, specifically in China and Thailand where we have significant investments. Maintaining a competitive advantage requires continuing investment with uncertain returns. We operate in highly competitive markets and have numerous competitors who may already be well established in those markets. We expect our competitors to continue improving the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products that could be competitive in both price and performance. We believe that we have certain technological advantages over our competitors, but maintaining these advantages requires us to continually invest in research and development, sales and marketing and Customer service and support. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in maintaining these advantages. We are currently making investments in emissions technology development and potential new emission systems products to meet the changing regulatory requirements worldwide. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in completing development or achieving sales of these products or that the margins on such products will be acceptable. Our financial performance may be negatively impacted if a competitors successful product innovation reaches the market before ours or gains broader market acceptance. 3 Table of Contents Several of our major OEM Customers manufacture filtration systems for their own use. Although these OEM Customers rely on us and other suppliers for some of their filtration systems, they sometimes choose to manufacture additional filtration systems for their own use. There is also a risk that a Customer could acquire one or more of our competitors. We may be adversely impacted by changes in technology that could reduce or eliminate the demand for our products. These risks include:  Breakthroughs in technology which provide a viable alternative to diesel engines.  Reduced demand for disk drive products if flash memory or a similar technology which would eliminate the need for our filtration solutions. We participate in highly competitive markets with pricing pressure. If we are not able to compete effectively our margins and results of operations could be adversely affected. The businesses and product lines in which we participate are very competitive and we risk losing business based on a wide range of factors, including technology, price, delivery, product performance and Customer service. Large Customers continue to seek productivity gains and lower prices from their suppliers. We may lose business or negatively impact our margins if we are unable to deliver the best value to our Customers. Demand for our products relies on economic and industrial conditions worldwide. Demand for our products tends to respond to varying levels of construction, agricultural, mining and industrial activity in the United States and in other industrialized nations. Sales to Caterpillar, Inc. and its subsidiaries accounted for 10 percent of our net sales in Fiscal 2008 and 2007. An adverse change in Caterpillars financial performance or a material reduction in our sales to it could negatively impact our operating results. Changes in our product mix impacts our financial performance. We sell products that have varying profit margins. Our financial performance can be impacted depending on the mix of products we sell during a given period. Unavailable or higher cost materials could result in our Customers being dissatisfied. We obtain raw material, including steel, filter media and plastics, and other components from third-party suppliers and tend to carry limited raw material inventories. An unanticipated delay in delivery by our suppliers could result in the inability to deliver on-time and meet the expectations of our Customers. This could negatively affect our financial performance. Difficulties with the Companys information technology systems could adversely affect the Companys results. The Company has many information technology systems that are important to the operation of its businesses. The Company could encounter difficulties in developing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems. Such difficulties could lead to significant expenses due to disruption in business operations and could adversely affect the Companys results. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our results and financial position. We have operations in many countries. Each of our subsidiaries reports its results of operations and financial position in its relevant foreign currency, which is then translated into U.S. dollars. This translated financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the foreign currencies of our subsidiaries could have a negative impact on our results and financial position. Acquisitions may have an impact on our results. We have made and continue to pursue acquisitions. We cannot guarantee that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our results. These acquisitions could negatively impact our profitability due to 4 Table of Contents operating and integration inefficiencies, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. There are also a number of other risks involved in acquisitions. We could lose key existing Customers, have difficulties in assimilating the acquired operations, assume unanticipated legal liabilities or lose key employees. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can be costly. We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We routinely incur costs in order to comply with these laws and regulations. We may be adversely impacted by new or changing laws and regulations that affect both our operations and our ability to develop and sell products that meet our Customers requirements. Item 1B.
