ITEM 1A. Risk Factors Benjamin P. Cowart, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, controls Vertex. Benjamin P. Cowart, Vertex’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns a total of approximately 36% of the total outstanding shares of the Company’s capital stock, and holds the right to vote an additional 22% of the Company’s capital stock pursuant to voting agreements entered into with various shareholders of Vertex, which voting agreements provide him the right to elect four (4) of Vertex’s five (5) directors (with the fifth director being appointed by the shareholders of Vertex’s Series A Preferred Stock). The voting agreements remain in effect until April 16, 2012. As such, subject to the resale terms and conditions of the voting agreements and the Lock-up Agreements (described below) which certain of Vertex’s shareholders signed, until April 12, 2012, Mr. Cowart will have the right, to appoint four (4) of Vertex’s five (5) directors, and therefore to exercise significant control over the Company, including making decisions with respect to issuing additional shares, entering into mergers, asset sales, and other fundamental transactions, and amending the terms of Vertex’s articles of incorporation. Vertex owes a significant amount of money on behalf of Vertex LP in connection with certain transactions affected pursuant to and in connection with the Merger. Pursuant to an Operating Agreement (described above) entered into between Vertex and Cedar Marine Terminals, L.P., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vertex LP (“CMT”), in connection with the Merger, Vertex has the right to a non-revocable, non-transferable, royalty-free, perpetual (except as provided in the agreement) license to use the technology associated with certain proprietary technology relating to the re-refining of certain oil feedstock referred to as our “Thermal/chemical extraction technology” in any market in the world (the “License”), provided that Vertex pays CMT the documented net development costs of the Thermal/chemical extraction technology, estimated to be $1.4 million (the “R&D Costs”), which have been paid in full to date. Additionally, pursuant to the Asset Transfer Agreement (described above) and the terms of the Merger, Vertex was required to assume up to $1.6 million of indebtedness from Vertex LP, of which $0.9 million has been paid to date. As such, Vertex is following a payment schedule agreed to by the Related Party Transaction Committee along with Vertex, LP which leaves approximately $0.7 million remaining, which we plan to pay in full by May 2010. Moving forward, Vertex may need to raise additional funding to pay the expenses described above, and as such may need to seek additional debt or equity financing. If debt financing is available and obtained, our interest expense may increase and we may be subject to the risk of default, depending on the terms of such financing. If equity financing is available and obtained it may result in our shareholders experiencing significant dilution. If such financing is unavailable, we may be forced to curtail our operations, which may cause the value of our securities to decline in value and/or become worthless. An event of default by Vertex LP, and a foreclosure of Vertex LP’s and CMT’s assets by Regions Bank, would materially adversely effect the Company’s operations and the value of its securities. Vertex LP, which is majority-owned and controlled by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Director, Benjamin P. Cowart, is a party to certain loan agreements, security agreements and related agreements with Regions Bank (“Regions”). In August 2009, Vertex LP (and certain other entities controlled by and/or associated with Vertex LP, including but not limited to CMT) received notice from Regions that Regions believed it was in default of certain borrowing criteria set forth in the loan agreement between Vertex LP and Regions, and that Vertex LP had until October 1, 2009 at the latest, to remedy such alleged defaults. Although Vertex LP is taking actions to remedy the defaults, they have not been remedied to date; however, Regions subsequently agreed to provide Vertex LP a 6 month extension of the due date of the loans made by Regions, and as a result, Vertex LP has until May 28, 2010, to repay amounts owed under the loan agreements, and similarly, Vertex LP believes that it has additional time to come to an understanding with Regions regarding its defaults. In the event that Vertex LP is unable to remedy its alleged defaults with Regions prior to May 28, 2010, Regions may declare the entire outstanding amount of the loan agreement in default and/or take action to enforce its security interests over substantially all of Vertex LP’s and CMT’s assets, including but not limited to the lease agreement pursuant to which CMT leases the land at the Terminal, and the assets and operations relating to the Company’s licensed thermal chemical extraction process. As a result, if Regions were to call Vertex LP’s debts in default and foreclose on Vertex LP’s assets, it may delay and/or prevent the Company from operating its thermal chemical extraction process (or potentially effect the license to use the technology), using the Terminal for its operations, and/or using any of the other services provided to the Company by Vertex LP’s affiliated companies. Therefore, if Regions were to declare Vertex LP in default of its loan agreements, it could result in the value of the Company’s securities becoming devalued and/or worthless and potentially force the Company to curtail or abandon its business plan or operations. -13- Vertex has no significant long-term assets and needs to rely on its contracts and relationships with Vertex LP and its affiliates and certain third parties, which could affect Vertex’s ability to operate its business. Vertex does not currently have any long-term assets, but instead its business is comprised of the rights to various contracts and arrangements. As such, moving forward, Vertex will need to rely on its relationships and agreements with Vertex LP and its affiliates, including with the following: · CrossRoad Carriers, for the transportation of Vertex’s feedstock of refined and re-refined petroleum products; · Cedar Marine Terminal LP, which will sublease terminal space to Vertex, and from which Vertex may purchase certain re-refining assets; and · Vertex Residual Management Group LP, which will perform environmental compliance and regulatory oversight for Vertex. Although Vertex has a right of first refusal to purchase the entities (including the assets of such entities), there can be no assurance that Vertex will exercise such right. In the event that any of the above-described relationships are terminated, Vertex may be forced to spend significant resources to identify and secure alternative sources to provide these services. There can be no assurance that Vertex will be able to locate such alternative sources on terms acceptable to it, or at all. As a result, Vertex may be unable to continue its operations in its current form, may be required to expend significant resources identifying alternative sources of services, and/or may be forced to expend significant resources to purchase and/or manufacture long-term assets, the construction of which assets may take a significant amount of time and capital to complete. Holders of shares of common stock will not have the right to vote for directors. Due to Mr. Cowart’s beneficial ownership of 36% of Vertex’s common stock and voting agreements which are in place, which allow him to vote an additional 22% of Vertex’s common stock for 4 of the 5 Directors of Vertex, at least one of whom must be “independent” as defined by the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. Cowart will have the right to appoint 4 of our 5 Directors until April 16, 2012. The holders of Vertex’s Series A preferred stock are entitled to elect the remaining Vertex director. Accordingly, so long as the voting agreements remain in effect and the shares of Vertex Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the minority holders of shares of Vertex’s common stock will not have the right to vote for the election of directors. Benjamin P. Cowart, Vertex’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, owns and is involved in other businesses that have relationships and agreements with Vertex, including, but not limited to Vertex LP. These relationships may cause conflicts of interest with Vertex. Benjamin P. Cowart, Vertex’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, also serves as the General Partner of and controls several other entities, including, but not limited to Vertex LP, through VTX, Inc. (collectively, the “Vertex Entities”), that have entered into transactions with, supplied feedstock for, and performed various business services for Vertex. These transactions and relationships include the following: -14- · Cross Road Carriers transports some of Vertex’s feedstock and refined and re-refined petroleum products; · Vertex subleases terminal space from CMT and may purchase certain re-refining assets, and perform certain other services for, Cedar Marine Terminal pursuant to other agreements described herein; · Vertex Residual Management Group LP performs environmental compliance and regulatory oversight for Vertex; and · Vertex Recovery collects used oil feedstock and sells it to Vertex. Vertex has (1) a right of first refusal to match any third-party offer to purchase any of the Vertex LP Entities on the terms and conditions set forth in such offer; and (2) the option, exercisable in Vertex’s sole discretion any time after the 18-month anniversary of the closing of the merger and so long as Mr. Cowart is employed by Vertex, to purchase all or any part of the outstanding stock of any of the Vertex LP Entities owned by Vertex LP or VTX, Inc., at a price based on an independent third-party valuation and appraisal of the fair market value of such Vertex LP Entity (the “Right of First Refusal”). Pursuant to the merger agreement, Vertex was required to form a committee of its board of directors (the “Related Party Transaction Committee”) including at least two “independent directors” (defined as any individuals who do not beneficially own more than 5% of the outstanding voting shares of Vertex, are not employed by, or officers of, Vertex or any entity related to Mr. Cowart, are not directors or managers of any such company, are not family members of Mr. Cowart, and would qualify as “Independent Directors” as defined in the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange). The Related Party Transaction Committee is charged with the review and pre-approval of any and all related party transactions, including between Vertex and Vertex LP, Mr. Cowart, or any other company or individual which may be affiliated with Mr. Cowart. Notwithstanding the Right of First Refusal and the Related Party Transaction Committee, perceived or actual conflicts of interest may exist between Mr. Cowart and Vertex in connection with the Vertex Entities and/or any other entity which Mr. Cowart may be affiliated and/or control in the future. Furthermore, if any disagreement were to occur between Mr. Cowart and/or any Vertex Entity, Vertex may be forced to find alternative suppliers and contractors to supply the services or products then supplied by any of the Vertex Entities, which new arrangements may not be on as favorable terms to Vertex and/or Mr. Cowart may be forced to make a decision between remaining in control of any of the Vertex Entities and/or Vertex. Such perceived or actual conflicts of interest may cause potential investors to not be willing to invest in Vertex, which could make it harder for Vertex to raise funds through the sale of debt and/or equity securities and/or cause Vertex’s securities to be devalued. As a result of these perceived and/or actual conflicts of interest, the value of Vertex’s securities may decrease in value and/or be valued less than similarly situated publicly-traded companies without such potential conflicts of interest. Vertex has established preferred stock which can be designated by the Vertex Board of Directors without shareholder approval and has established Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock, which gives the holders a liquidation preference and the ability to convert such shares into Vertex’s common stock. Vertex has 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized which includes 5 million shares of designated Series A preferred stock of which approximately 4.7 million shares are issued and outstanding and 2,000,000 designated shares of Series B preferred stock, of which 100,000 shares are outstanding as of the date of this report. The Vertex Series A preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $1.49 per share. As a result, if Vertex were to dissolve, liquidate or sell its assets, the holders of Vertex’s Series A preferred stock would have the right to receive up to the first approximately $7.0 million in proceeds from any such transaction. Additionally, the Series B preferred stock has a liquidation preference which is junior to the Series A preferred stock, senior securities and other security holders (other than the common stock shareholders) equal to the face value of such Series B preferred stock, $1.00 per share. Consequently, holders of Vertex common stock may receive less consideration or no consideration in connection with such a transaction. Furthermore, the conversion of Series A preferred stock into common stock and/or conversion of Series B preferred stock into common stock may cause substantial dilution to Vertex’s common shareholders. Additionally, because Vertex’s board of directors is entitled to designate the powers and preferences of the preferred stock without a vote of its shareholders, Vertex’s shareholders will have no control over what designations and preferences Vertex’s future preferred stock, if any, will have. -15- Vertex’s shareholders may have difficulty selling their shares because such shares will likely be deemed “penny stock.” Since the shares of Vertex’s common stock are not be listed on a national securities exchange, if the trading price of such shares is below $5.00 per share, trading in such shares will be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a penny stock (generally, any equity security not listed on a national securities exchange that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions). Such rules require the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally defined as an investor with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 individually or $300,000 together with a spouse). For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to the sale. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to the broker-dealer, current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer’s presumed control over the market. Such information must be provided to the customer orally or in writing before or with the written confirmation of trade sent to the customer. Monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in Vertex’s common stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of such shares of common stock and the ability of such holders to sell their shares. The market price of Vertex’s common stock may be adversely affected by market volatility. The market price of Vertex’s common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to many factors, including: · actual or anticipated variations in Vertex’s operating results; · developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights; · announcements of technological innovations by Vertex or its competitors; · announcements of new products or new contracts by Vertex or its competitors; · changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and whether Vertex’s earnings meet or exceed such estimates; · conditions and trends in the industries in which Vertex operates; · changing environmental standards; · new accounting standards; · general economic, political and market conditions and other factors; and · the occurrence of any of the other risks described in this report. -16- RISKS RELATING TO VERTEX’S BUSINESS Vertex’s contracts may not be renewed and its existing relationships may not continue, which could be exacerbated by the fact that a limited number of Vertex’s customers represented a significant portion of Vertex’s sales. Vertex’s contracts and relationships in the black oil business include feedstock purchasing agreements with local waste oil collectors, an off-take arrangement with one re-refinery, along with a few key relationships in the bunkering, blending and No. 6 oil industry. Because Vertex’s operations are extremely dependent on the black oil key bunkering, blending and No. 6 oil relationships as well as its third-party refining contracts, if we were to lose relationships there would be a material adverse effect on Vertex’s operations and results of operations. Additionally, if Vertex were to lose any of its current local waste oil collectors, Vertex could be required to spend additional resources locating and providing incentives for other waste oil collectors, which could cause Vertex’s expenses to increase and/or cause it to curtail or abandon its business plans. This is exacerbated by the fact that five large companies with various independent divisions represented 26%, 17%, 14%, 14% and 13% of the Company’s gross sales and four of these companies represented 6%, 32%, 17% and 21% of outstanding trade receivables for the year ended December 31, 2009. As a result, if the Company were to lose any of its largest revenue producing relationships, the Company may be forced to expend additional resources attempting to secure replacement relationships, which may not be on as favorable terms as its current relationships, if such relationships can be secured at all. A significant portion of our historical revenues are a result of our agreement with KMTEX, which can be terminated by either party with sixty days prior notice. We have an agreement in place with KMTEX, pursuant to which KMTEX has agreed to process feedstock of certain petroleum distillates, which we provide to KMTEX into more valuable feedstocks, including pygas, gasoline blend stock and MDO/cutter stock, which agreement expires on June 30, 2010, but is subject to a three year extension upon the mutual agreement of both parties. The agreement can be terminated upon sixty days prior written notice by either party at any time. If KMTEX were to terminate and/or not agree to renew our agreement with it, we would be forced to spend resources attempting to locate another party which we could supply our feedstock which could take substantial time, if such alternative party is even available. If we are able to find another contracting party, the terms of the understanding or agreement with such contracting party may be on terms less favorable to us and/or may force us to transport our feedstock a greater distance. As a result of the above, if we were to lose our agreement with KMTEX our expenses may increase, our results of operations may decrease and/or it may cause us to curtail or abandon our business plans, all of which would likely cause the value of our securities to decrease in value. Vertex operates in competitive markets, and there can be no certainty that Vertex will maintain its current customers or attract new customers or that its operating margins will not be impacted by competition. The industries in which Vertex operates are highly competitive. Vertex competes with numerous local and regional companies of varying sizes and financial resources in its refining and feedstock consolidation operations, and expects to compete with larger oil companies, with significantly greater resources than Vertex, in its planned oil re-refining operations. Vertex expects competition to intensify in the future. Furthermore, numerous well-established companies are focusing significant resources on providing refining and re-refining services that will compete with Vertex’s services. We cannot assure you that Vertex will be able to effectively compete with these other companies or that competitive pressures, including possible downward pressure on the prices Vertex charges for its products and services, will not arise. In the event that Vertex cannot effectively compete on a continuing basis, or competitive pressures arise, such inability to compete or competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on Vertex’s business, results of operations and financial condition. -17- Disruptions in the supply of feedstock could have an adverse effect on Vertex’s business. Vertex depends on the continuing availability of raw materials, including feedstock, to remain in production. A serious disruption in supply of feedstock, or significant increases in the prices of feedstock, could significantly reduce the availability of raw materials at Vertex’s plant. Additionally, increases in production costs could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, Vertex has previously experienced difficulty in obtaining feedstock from its suppliers who, because of the sharp downturn in the price of oil (used and otherwise) have seen their margins decrease substantially, which in some cases has made it uneconomical for such suppliers to purchase feedstock from their suppliers and/or sell to Vertex at the rates set forth in their contracts. Any similar decline in the price of oil and/or the economy in general could create a decrease in the supply of feedstock, prevent Vertex from maintaining its required levels of output and/or force Vertex to seek out additional suppliers of feedstock, who may charge more than its current suppliers, and therefore adversely affect its results of operations. Vertex is subject to numerous environmental and other laws and regulations and, to the extent Vertex is found to be in violation of any such laws and regulations, Vertex’s business could be materially and adversely affected. Vertex is subject to extensive federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment which, among other things: · regulate the collection, transportation, handling, processing and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes; · impose liability on persons involved in generating, handling, processing, transporting or disposing hazardous materials; · impose joint and several liability for remediation and clean-up of environmental contamination; and · require financial assurance that funds will be available for the closure and post-closure care of sites where hazardous wastes are stored, processed or disposed. The breadth and complexity of all of these laws and regulations affecting Vertex make consistent compliance extremely difficult and often result in increased operating and compliance costs, including requiring the implementation of new programs to promote compliance. Even with these programs, Vertex and other companies in the industry are routinely faced with legal and administrative proceedings which can result in civil and criminal penalties, interruption of business operations, fines or other sanctions and require expenditures. Under current law, Vertex may be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before it acquired its assets and/or before it took control of its leased properties or if it arranges for the transportation, disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination. In the future, Vertex may be subject to monetary fines, civil or criminal penalties, remediation, clean-up or stop orders, injunctions, orders to cease or suspend certain practices or denial of permits required to operate its facilities and conduct its operations. The outcome of any proceeding and associated costs and expenses could have a material adverse impact on Vertex’s operations and financial condition. -18- Environmental laws and regulations are subject to change and may become increasingly stringent or relaxed. Interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations, or the adoption of new laws and regulations, may require Vertex to modify or curtail its operations or replace or upgrade its facilities or equipment at substantial costs which it may not be able to pass on to its customers. On the other hand, if new laws and regulations are less stringent, then Vertex’s customers or competitors may be able to compete with Vertex more effectively, without reliance on its services, which could decrease the need for its services and/or increase competition which could adversely affect its revenues and profitability, if any. Vertex is required to obtain and maintain permits, licenses and approvals to conduct its operations in compliance with such laws and regulations. If Vertex is unable to maintain its currently held permits, licenses and approvals, it may not be able to continue certain of its operations. If it is unable to obtain any additional permits, licenses and approvals which may be required as Vertex expands its operations, it may be forced to curtail or abandon its current and/or future planned business operations. Vertex could be subject to involuntary shutdowns or be required to pay significant monetary damages or remediation costs if it is found to be a responsible party for the improper handling or the release of hazardous substances. As a company engaged in the sale, handling, transportation, storage, recycling and disposal of materials that are or may be classified as hazardous by federal, state, provincial or other regulatory agencies, Vertex faces risks of liability for environmental contamination. The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, or “CERCLA” or Superfund, and similar state laws impose strict liability for clean-up costs on current or former owners and operators of facilities that release hazardous substances into the environment, as well as on the businesses that generate those substances or transport them. As a potentially responsible party, or “PRP,” Vertex may be liable under CERCLA for substantial investigation and cleanup costs even if it operates its business properly and complies with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Liability under CERCLA may be joint and several, which means that if it were found to be a business with responsibility for a particular CERCLA site, Vertex could be required to pay the entire cost of the investigation and cleanup, even though it was not the party responsible for the release of the hazardous substance and even though other companies might also be liable. Even if Vertex is able to identify who the other responsible parties might be, it may not be able to compel them to contribute to the remediation costs, or they might be insolvent or unable to contribute due to lack of financial resources. Vertex’s facilities and the facilities of its clients and third-party contractors may have generated, used, handled and/or disposed of hazardous substances and other regulated wastes. Environmental liabilities could exist, including cleanup obligations at these facilities or at off-site locations, which could result in future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could materially reduce Vertex’s profits. In addition, new services or products offered by Vertex could expose it to further environmental liabilities for which it has no historical experience and cannot estimate its potential exposure to liabilities. Vertex is dependent on third parties for the disposal of its waste streams. Vertex does not own any waste disposal sites. As a result, it is dependent on third parties for the disposal of waste streams. To date, disposal vendors have met their requirements, but we cannot assure you that they will continue to do so. If for some reason Vertex’s current disposal vendors cannot perform up to standards, Vertex may be required to replace them. Although Vertex believes there are a number of potential replacement disposal vendors that could provide such services, it may incur additional costs and delays in identifying and qualifying such replacements. In addition, any mishandling of its waste streams by disposal vendors could expose Vertex to liability. Any failure by disposal vendors to properly collect, transport, handle or dispose of Vertex’s waste streams could expose it to liability, damage its reputation and generally have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. Worsening economic conditions and trends and downturns in the business cycles of the industries Vertex serves and which provide services to Vertex would impact its business and operating results. A significant portion of Vertex’s customer base is comprised of companies in the chemical manufacturing and hydrocarbon recovery industries. The overall levels of demand for its products, refining operations, and future planned re-refined oil products, are driven by fluctuations in levels of end-user demand, which depend in large part on general macroeconomic conditions in the U.S., as well as regional economic conditions. For example, many of Vertex’s principal consumers are themselves heavily dependent on general economic conditions, including the price of fuel and energy, availability of affordable credit and capital, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and housing demand. These cyclical shifts in Vertex’s customers’ businesses may result in fluctuations in demand, volumes, pricing and operating margins for its services and products. In addition to its customers, the suppliers of Vertex’s feedstock may also be affected by downturns in the economy and adverse changes in the price of feedstock. For example, Vertex has recently experienced difficulty obtaining feedstock from its suppliers who, because of the sharp downturn in the price of oil (used and otherwise) have seen their margins decrease substantially, which in some cases have made it uneconomical for such suppliers to purchase feedstock from their suppliers and/or sell to Vertex at the rates set forth in their contracts. Any similar decline in the price of oil and/or the economy in general could create a decrease in the supply of feedstock, prevent Vertex from maintaining its required levels of output and/or force Vertex to seek additional suppliers of feedstock, who may charge more than its current suppliers, and therefore adversely affect its results of operations. -19- Vertex’s operating margins and profitability may be negatively impacted by changes in fuel and energy costs. Vertex transports its refined oil, and plans in the future to transport re-refined oil, with trucks and by rail. As a result, increases in shipping and transportation costs caused by increases in oil, gasoline and diesel prices have a significant impact on its operating expenses. The price and supply of oil and gas is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events beyond Vertex’s control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and natural gas, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. A significant increase in transportation or fuel costs could lower Vertex’s operating margins and negatively impact its profitability. Additionally, the price at which Vertex sells its refined oil and its re-refined oil is affected by changes in certain oil indexes. If the relevant oil index rises, Vertex anticipates being able to increase the prices for its refined and re-refined oil. If the relevant oil index declines, Vertex anticipates having to reduce prices for its refined and re-refined oil. However, the cost to collect used oil and refinery feedstock, including the amounts that must be paid to obtain used oil and feedstock, generally also increases or decreases when the relevant index increases or decreases. Even though the prices that can be charged for Vertex’s refined (and in the future, re-refined) products and the costs to collect, refine, and re-refine the feedstock generally increase and decrease together, Vertex cannot assure you that when the costs to collect, refine and re-refine used oil and petrochemical products increase, Vertex will be able to increase the prices it charges for its refined and re-refined products to cover such increased costs, or that the costs to collect, refine and re-refine used oil and petrochemical products will decline when the prices Vertex can charge for its products declines. If the prices Vertex charges for its finished products and the costs to collect, refine and re-refine products do not move together or in similar magnitudes, Vertex’s profitability may be materially and negatively impacted. Expansion of Vertex’s business may result in unanticipated adverse consequences. In the future, Vertex may seek to grow its business by investing in new or existing facilities or technologies, making acquisitions or entering into partnerships and joint ventures. Acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures or investments may require significant managerial attention, which may divert management from its other activities and may impair the operation of Vertex’s existing businesses. Any future acquisitions of businesses or facilities could entail a number of additional risks, including: · the failure to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or facilities or new technology into Vertex’s operations; · the inability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships; · loss of key personnel of the acquired business or facility; · exposure to unanticipated liabilities; and · the failure to realize efficiencies, synergies and cost savings. As a result of these and other factors, including the general economic risk associated with the industries in which it operates, Vertex may not be able to realize the expected benefits from any future acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures or other investments. -20- Vertex depends heavily on the services of its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Benjamin P. Cowart. Vertex’s success depends heavily upon the personal efforts and abilities of Benjamin P. Cowart, its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, who is employed by Vertex under a five-year employment contract. Vertex does not currently have any “key man” life insurance policy in place for Mr. Cowart. Mr. Cowart has numerous business relationships with entities separate from Vertex which could take a significant portion of his time and/or could cause conflicts of interest with Vertex’s operations. The loss of Mr. Cowart or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on Vertex’s business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the absence of Mr. Cowart may force Vertex to seek a replacement who may have less experience or who may not understand Vertex’s business as well, or Vertex may not be able to find a suitable replacement. Unanticipated problems or delays in building Vertex’s facilities to the proper specifications may harm its business and viability. Vertex’s future growth will depend on its ability to timely and economically complete and operate its planned re-refining facility and operate its existing refining operations. If Vertex’s operations are disrupted or its economic integrity is threatened for unexpected reasons, its business may experience a substantial setback. Moreover, the occurrence of significant unforeseen conditions or events in connection with the construction of Vertex’s planned facility may require it to reexamine its business model. Any change to Vertex’s business model or management’s evaluation of the viability of its planned services may adversely affect its business. Construction costs for Vertex’s facility may also increase to a level that would make a new facility too expensive to complete or unprofitable to operate. Contractors, engineering firms, construction firms and equipment suppliers also receive requests and orders from other companies and, therefore, Vertex may not be able to secure their services or products on a timely basis or on acceptable financial terms. Vertex may suffer significant delays or cost overruns as a result of a variety of factors, such as increases in the prices of raw materials, shortages of workers or materials, transportation constraints, adverse weather, equipment failures, fires, damage to or destruction of property and equipment, environmental damage, unforeseen difficulties or labor issues, any of which could prevent Vertex from commencing operations as expected at its planned re-refining facility. Strategic relationships on which Vertex relies are subject to change. Vertex’s ability to identify and enter into commercial arrangements with feedstock suppliers and refined and re-refined oil clients depends on developing and maintaining close working relationships with industry participants. Vertex’s success in this area also depends on its ability to select and evaluate suitable projects as well as to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. These factors are subject to change and may impair Vertex’s ability to grow. Disruptions to infrastructure could materially and adversely affect Vertex’s business. Vertex’s business depends on the continuing availability of railroad, port, storage and distribution infrastructure. Any disruptions in this infrastructure network, whether caused by labor difficulties, earthquakes, storms, other natural disasters, human error or malfeasance or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on Vertex’s business. Vertex relies on third parties to maintain the rail lines from their plants to the national rail network, and any failure by these third parties to maintain the lines could impede the delivery of products, impose additional costs and could have a material adverse effect on Vertex’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, recent damage to the Cedar Marine Terminal as a result of Hurricane Ike (which caused the terminal to temporarily be out of operation), resulted in increased costs associated with the shipping of feedstock through third party contractors, thereby raising the overall cost of the feedstock and lowering Vertex’s margins. Additional hurricanes or natural disasters in the future could cause similar damage to Vertex’s infrastructure, prevent Vertex from generating revenues while such infrastructure is undergoing repair (if repairable) and/or cause Vertex’s margins and therefore its results of operations to be adversely affected. -21- Vertex’s commercial success will depend in part on its ability to obtain and maintain protection of its intellectual property. Vertex’s success will depend in part on its ability to maintain or obtain and enforce any future patent rights and/or other intellectual property protection for its technologies and to preserve its trade secrets, and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. Vertex has not obtained patents (although patent applications for the Company’s licensed Thermo-Chemical Extraction Process are pending, which patent pending is owned by Vertex LP and/or its affiliates) in the United States or internationally for its technology to date. We cannot assure you that if Vertex files patent applications for its technologies, such patents will be granted or that the scope of any claims granted in any patent will provide Vertex with proprietary protection or a competitive advantage. We cannot assure you that if granted, such patents will be valid or will afford Vertex with protection against competitors with similar technology. The failure to obtain or maintain patent or other intellectual property protection on the technologies underlying Vertex’s technologies may have a material adverse effect on its competitive position and business prospects. It is also possible that Vertex’s technologies may infringe on patents or other intellectual property rights owned by others. Vertex may have to alter its products or processes, pay licensing fees, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court, or cease activities altogether because of patent rights of third parties, thereby causing additional unexpected costs and delays to it. We cannot assure you that a license will be available to Vertex, if at all, upon terms and conditions acceptable to it or that it will prevail in any intellectual property litigation. Intellectual property litigation is costly and time consuming, and we cannot assure you that Vertex will have sufficient resources to pursue such litigation. If Vertex does not obtain a license under such intellectual property rights, is found liable for infringement or is not able to have such patents declared invalid, Vertex may be liable for significant money damages and may encounter significant delays in bringing products to market. Competition may impair Vertex’s success. New technologies may be developed by others that could compete with Vertex’s refining and re-refining technologies. In addition, Vertex faces competition from other producers of oil substitutes and related products. Such competition is expected to be intense and could significantly drive down the price for Vertex’s products. Competition will likely increase as prices of energy in the commodities market, including refined and re-refined oil, rise. Additionally, new companies are constantly entering the market, thus increasing the competition even further. These companies may have greater success in the recruitment and retention of qualified employees, as well as in conducting their own refining and re-refining operations, and may have greater access to feedstock, market presence, economies of scale, financial resources and engineering, technical and marketing capabilities, which may give them a competitive advantage. In addition, actual or potential competitors may be strengthened through the acquisition of additional assets and interests. If Vertex is unable to compete effectively or adequately respond to competitive pressures, this may materially adversely affect its results of operation and financial condition and could also have a negative impact on its ability to obtain additional capital from investors. Potential competition from Vertex’s existing employees and affiliated entities could negatively impact Vertex’s profitability. Although Mr. Cowart and other employees of Vertex are prohibited from competing with Vertex while they are employed with Vertex and for six months thereafter, none of such individuals will be prohibited from competing with Vertex after such six month period ends. Additionally, none of Mr. Cowart’s affiliated companies, including Vertex LP, are prohibited from competing with Vertex Accordingly, any of these individuals or entities could be in a position to use industry experience gained while working with Vertex to compete with Vertex Such competition could increase Vertex’s costs to obtain feedstock, and increase its costs for contracting use of operating assets and services such as third party refining capacity, trucking services or terminal access. Furthermore, such competition could distract or confuse customers, reduce the value of Vertex’s intellectual property and trade secrets, or result in a reduction in the prices Vertex is able to obtain for its finished products. Any of the foregoing could reduce Vertex’s future revenues, earnings or growth prospects. Competition due to advances in renewable fuels may lessen the demand for Vertex’s products and negatively impact its profitability. Alternatives to petroleum-based products and production methods are continually under development. For example, a number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells or clean-burning gaseous fuels that may address increasing worldwide energy costs, the long-term availability of petroleum reserves and environmental concerns, which if successful could lower the demand for Vertex’s services. If these non-petroleum based products and oil alternatives continue to expand and gain broad acceptance such that the overall demand for Vertex’s products is reduced, it may not be able to compete effectively in the marketplace. -22- Vertex will rely on new technology to conduct its business, including the Thermal Chemical Extraction Process, and its technology could become ineffective or obsolete. Vertex will be required to continually enhance and update its technology to maintain its efficiency and to avoid obsolescence. Additionally, Vertex initially plans to rely on the License from CMT in connection with the Thermal/chemical extraction technology (the “Process”). The Process is currently commercially unproven and may never work in a profitable manner, if at all. Currently the Process is not producing at expected levels and not producing the quality of product we had originally planned to produce. As a result, the total revenues generated by the process have been below our previous estimates. The Process may be unable to produce the level or quality of product we originally hoped and as a result, our results of operations may be adversely affected and the value of our securities may decline in value. Additionally, the costs moving forward of enhancing and updating our technology may be substantial and may be higher than the costs that we anticipated for technology maintenance and development. If Vertex is unable to maintain the efficiency of its technology, its ability to manage its business and to compete may be impaired. Even if Vertex is able to maintain technical effectiveness, its technology may not be the most efficient means of reaching its objectives, in which case it may incur higher operating costs than it would if its technology was more effective. The impact of technical shortcomings, including but not limited to the failure of the Process, could have a material adverse effect on Vertex’s prospects, business, financial condition, and results of operations. Vertex’s business is subject to local, legal, political, and economic factors which are beyond its control. Vertex believes that the current political environment for construction of its planned re-refining facility is sufficiently supportive to enable it to plan and implement its operations. However, there are risks that conditions will change in an adverse manner. These risks include, but are not limited to, environmental issues, land use, air emissions, water use, zoning, workplace safety, restrictions imposed on the re-refining industry such as restrictions on production, substantial changes in product quality standards, restrictions on feedstock supply, price controls and export controls. Any changes in financial incentives, investment regulations, policies or a shift in political attitudes are beyond the control of Vertex and may adversely affect its business and future financial results. Environmental risks and regulations may adversely affect Vertex’s business. All phases of designing, constructing and operating Vertex’s refining and planned re-refining plant present environmental risks and hazards. Vertex is subject to environmental regulation implemented or imposed by a variety of federal, state and municipal laws and regulations as well as international conventions. Among other things, environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on spills and discharges, as well as emissions of various substances produced in association with Vertex’s operations. Legislation also requires that facility sites be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed in such a way that would satisfy applicable regulatory authorities. Compliance with such legislation can require significant expenditures and a breach could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, some of which could be material. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner Vertex expects may result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability, as well as potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs. The presence or discharge of pollutants in or into the air, soil or water may give rise to liabilities to governments and third parties and may require Vertex to incur costs to remedy such presence or discharge. If Vertex is unable to remediate such conditions economically or obtain reimbursement or indemnification from third parties, its financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Vertex cannot assure you that the application of environmental laws to its business will not cause it to limit its production, to significantly increase the costs of its operations and activities, to reduce the market for its products or to otherwise adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations or prospects. -23- Penalties Vertex may incur could impair its business. Failure to comply with government regulations could subject Vertex to civil and criminal penalties and may negatively affect the value of its assets or its ability to conduct its business. Vertex may also be required to take corrective actions, including, but not limited to, installing additional equipment, which could require it to make substantial capital expenditures. Vertex could also be required to indemnify its employees in connection with any expenses or liabilities that they may incur individually in connection with regulatory action against Vertex. These could result in a material adverse effect on Vertex’s prospects, business, financial condition and its results of operations. If Vertex cannot maintain adequate insurance coverage, it will be unable to continue certain operations. Vertex’s business exposes it to various risks, including claims for causing damage to property and injuries to persons that may involve allegations of negligence or professional errors or omissions in the performance of its services. Such claims could be substantial. Vertex believes that its insurance coverage is presently adequate and similar to, or greater than, the coverage maintained by other similarly situated companies in the industry. If Vertex is unable to obtain adequate or required insurance coverage in the future, or if such insurance is not available at affordable rates, Vertex could be in violation of its permit conditions and other requirements of the environmental laws, rules and regulations under which it operates. Such violations could render Vertex unable to continue certain of its operations. These events could result in an inability to operate certain assets and significantly impair its financial condition. Increases in energy costs will affect Vertex’s operating results and financial condition. Vertex’s production costs will be dependent on the costs of the energy sources used to run its facilities and to procure feedstock. These costs are subject to fluctuations and variations, and Vertex may not be able to predict or control these costs. If these costs exceed Vertex’s expectations, this may adversely affect its results of operations. Vertex’s insurance policies do not cover all losses, costs or liabilities that it may experience. Vertex maintains insurance coverage, but these policies do not cover all of its potential losses, costs or liabilities. Vertex could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks, or in amounts in excess of its existing insurance coverage, which would significantly affect its financial performance. Vertex’s insurance policies also have deductibles and self-retention limits that could expose it to significant financial expense. Vertex’s ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on Vertex’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Vertex’s business requires that it maintain various types of insurance. If such insurance is not available or not available on economically acceptable terms, Vertex’s business would be materially and adversely affected. If Vertex is unable to maintain a line of credit, it could have an adverse effect on Vertex’s business. Our Line of Credit with Regions bank comes due on May 25, 2010 (as described in greater detail below). Vertex relies heavily on the availability and utilization of this line of credit for its operations and for the purchase of inventory. If Vertex is unable to renew or replace this facility it may be forced to curtail or abandon its current and/or future planned business operations. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable.
