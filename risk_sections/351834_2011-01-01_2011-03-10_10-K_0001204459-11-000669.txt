Risk Factors, included elsewhere in this annual report. SUNOPTA INC. 4 January 1, 2011 10-K PART I Item 1. Business Introduction SunOpta Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of Canada in 1973, divides its operations into the following two industry segments: SunOpta Foods, which accounted for approximately 91% of 2010 consolidated revenues. Opta Minerals Inc. (Opta Minerals), which represented approximately 9% of 2010 consolidated revenues. SunOpta Foods operates in the natural, organic and specialty foods and natural health product sectors. We believe these markets will continue to grow as consumers focus on health and wellness. SunOpta Foods is comprised of four separate operating groups: Grains and Foods Group, Ingredients Group, Fruit Group, and International Foods Group. These groups use a combination of vertically integrated seed to table capabilities and preferred sourcing contracts combined with extensive processing and product development capabilities to serve the natural, organic and specialty foods and natural health product sectors. Opta Minerals processes, sells and distributes silica-free loose abrasives and other specialty industrial minerals to the foundry, steel, loose abrasive cleaning, roofing shingle, construction and marine/bridge cleaning industries; sources specialty sands and garnets for the water filtration industry; and recycles inorganic materials under special permits from government authorities at both its Waterdown, Ontario and Norfolk, Virginia sites. The common shares of Opta Minerals are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), under the symbol OPM. We currently own 66.4% of its issued and outstanding common shares. Segment Information We report both of our industry segments - SunOpta Foods and Opta Minerals - as separate segments. Our assets, operations and employees are principally located in North America, and, to a lesser extent in Europe and other geographies due primarily to the 2007 acquisition of Newco a.s. (Slovak Republic) by Opta Minerals and the acquisitions in 2008 of The Organic Corporation B.V. (The Netherlands) by SunOpta Foods and MCP Mg-Serbien SAS (France) by Opta Minerals. Financial information for each segment describing revenues from external customers, a measure of profit or loss, and total assets for the last three fiscal years, as well as financial information about geographic areas for the last three fiscal years, is set forth in note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Major Corporate Developments in 2010 and 2011 On December 20, 2010, we entered into a Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions. The new credit facilities, which provide for asset-based, revolving credit facilities of up to $100,000 and Cdn $5,000 (subject to borrowing base availability), and non-revolving term credit facilities totaling $30,000, replaced the asset-based revolving and non-revolving term lines that existed in our previous credit facilities. The facilities mature on October 30, 2012. On September 24, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concluded their investigation in connection with the restatement of the Companys financial statements for each of the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2007, June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2007. The SEC reached a settlement with the Company, Mr. Bromley, President and CEO, and Mr. Dietrich, the former CFO of the Company. The settlement concluded the SECs inquiry. SUNOPTA INC. 5 January 1, 2011 10-K On September 1, 2010, we completed the sale of SunOpta BioProcess Inc. ("SBI") to Mascoma Canada Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mascoma Corporation ("Mascoma"). The combination of the two companies brings together SBI's fiber preparation and pretreatment technology with Mascoma's consolidated bioprocessing ("CBP") technology, to create a company with comprehensive capabilities for converting nonfood cellulose (wood chips, energy crops and organic solid waste) into ethanol and high value coproducts. As consideration for selling all of the outstanding common shares of SBI, we received a 19.61% ownership interest in Mascoma, which included a combination of preferred and common shares as well as warrants valued at $33,345, after settling the preferred share liability with the former SBI preferred shareholders. Before settling with the preferred shareholders, the transaction valued SBI at $50,925. Since the transaction, we have accounted for our ownership position in Mascoma on a cost basis and, as a result, have not included any of the financial results of Mascoma in our operational results. As at January 1, 2011, our ownership interest in Mascoma remains at 19.61%. On July 7, 2010 we appointed Mr. Alan Murray to our Board of Directors. Mr. Murray brings strong business experience to the SunOpta Board of Directors with a background in manufacturing, business turn-around situations, business integration and profitable organic growth. Mr. Murray has lived and worked abroad including in Western and Eastern Europe and Africa. Most recently Mr. Murray served as President and CEO of Tetra Pak, North America. On May 19, 2010 both the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York approved an agreement to settle all claims raised in class action proceedings arising from our restatement of interim financial results for the first three quarters of 2007. The settlement became effective on June 17, 2010, upon expiry of the period for filing an appeal. In return for the dismissal of the class actions and releases from class members of settled claims against the Company and the named defendants, the settlement agreement provided for a total cash contribution of U.S. $11,250 (funded entirely by our insurer) to a settlement fund and the adoption of certain corporate governance enhancements. The settlement agreement contained no admission of wrongdoing by SunOpta or any of the other named defendants. SUNOPTA FOODS SunOpta Foods has been built through the acquisition of 23 business operations and through significant internal growth. It is a vertically integrated natural, organic and specialty foods and natural health products company, with global operations, serving domestic and international markets and representing approximately 91% of our consolidated revenues. Below is a summary listing of acquisitions and significant facilities that we have acquired since the inception of SunOpta Foods. The summary below does not include any acquisitions related to divestitures that occurred in 2010. See notes 2 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of our most recent acquisitions and divestitures. Date of Acquisition Business Operations Acquired August 3, 1999 Sunrich Inc (Grains and Foods Group) August 15, 2000 Certain assets of Hoffman Aseptic (Grains and Foods Group) September 18, 2000 Northern Food and Dairy, Inc.

(International Foods Group) April 2, 2008 The Organic Corporation (International Foods Group) November 8, 2010 Dahlgren & Company, Inc. (Grains and Foods Group) December 14, 2010 Assets of Edner of Nevada, Inc. (Fruit Group) SUNOPTA INC. 6 January 1, 2011 10-K SunOpta Foods long-term strategy is to leverage the platform that has been developed via implementation of continuous improvement principles, new product development and a focus on value-added components of the business, and to continue to pursue selective acquisitions that align with the value-added components of our vertically integrated business model. We believe that the natural, organic and specialty foods and natural health products markets offer solid long-term growth opportunities as consumers focus on health and wellness and see diet as a key part of a healthy lifestyle. We also believe these markets remain fragmented with numerous players in North America and internationally. Specific strategies of SunOpta Foods in the last several years have included the following. Diversify the range of organic and non-genetically modified (non-GMO) grains-based and fruit-based products that we market, including via the acquisition of businesses that are vertically integrated from sourcing through ingredients and packaged products. Develop value-added natural and organic fiber and food ingredient solutions to meet the demands of food manufacturers wanting to improve the healthfulness of their products or expand into the natural and organic markets. Expand our ability to source and supply natural and organic food products worldwide. Invest in healthy convenience and nutritious portable foods via both internal growth opportunities and acquisition, driven by our belief that this segment will continue to be a strong area of growth for natural and organic food products. Expand the number of customer private label natural and organic programs including soy and alternative beverages, frozen fruit, fruit beverages and healthy convenience food categories. Develop and expand our operations outside of North America via acquisitions or by entering into partnerships and strategic alliances with food producers internationally. Major Developments in 2010 and 2011 in SunOpta Foods We continue to improve our positioning in the natural, organic and specialty foods and natural health products sectors through internal growth and selective acquisitions. Achievements through February 28, 2011 include the following: On December 14, 2010 we completed the acquisition of the assets and business of Edner of Nevada, Inc. ("Edner") for cash consideration and amounts payable for additional working capital of $4,458, plus an earnout based on pre-determined revenue targets over a five-year period. Edner produces a wide variety of nutritious portable foods such as nutrition bars and grains and fruit based snack bars serving the fast growing wholesome and convenient healthy snacks category from its 104,000 square foot facility, located in Carson City, Nevada. The completion of the acquisition of Edner should enable us to extend the breadth of our healthy snack offerings via the introduction of innovative new products utilizing the capabilities that exist within Edner. On November 8, 2010 we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Dahlgren & Company Inc. (Dahlgren) for cash consideration and amounts payable for additional working capital of $46,303, plus an earnout based on predetermined earnings targets over a twoyear period. Dahlgren is an integrated processor and global supplier of confection sunflower seed products including inshell and kernel products, roasted sunflower and soy nuts, bird food, hybrid seed and other products. Dahlgren serves customers in the United States and Canada, as well as Europe, Asia, Australia and South America. The combination of the Dahlgren business with the Companys existing confection sunflower business is expected to be synergistic and create one of the largest confection sunflower businesses in the world. SUNOPTA INC. 7 January 1, 2011 10-K On June 29, 2010 we entered into an exclusive agreement with Clearwater Country Foods of Genesee, Idaho, to market and distribute Clearwater's Garden Green Garbanzo. Clearwater is a pioneer of sustainable green garbanzo bean production in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, we are responsible for global sales and distribution of the Garden Green Garbanzo and Clearwater provides exclusive sourcing and supply services. Prior to signing the agreement we had been working with Clearwater for approximately eighteen months, performing extensive market analysis to assess the potential of the sustainable and healthy green garbanzo and hummus markets including applications for retail, food service and industrial customers. On June 11, 2010 we completed the sale of our Canadian Food Distribution assets to UNFI Canada, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Natural Foods, Inc., for cash consideration of $65,809 (Cdn $68,000). We realized a net gain on the sale of these assets, after tax, of $12,796. The divestiture of the Canadian Food Distribution assets was an important step in our strategy to focus on our core food manufacturing platform, further strengthening our balance sheet and positioning SunOpta for the future. The Canadian Food Distribution assets included in the sale formed part of the former SunOpta Distribution Group. Our Canadian based natural health products distribution and manufacturing assets which were also part of the SunOpta Distribution Group were not included in the sale. On February 23, 2010, our Grains and Foods Group completed an upgrade and retrofit at our Alexandria, Minnesota aseptic processing and packaging facility and commenced the first production of natural broth and soup products for a major international packaged goods company. This upgrade gave us the capacity to produce approximately 250 million liters annually of natural and organic alternative beverages such as soy, rice, almond and others as well as broth and soup products and also expands our packaging size capabilities for these products for a variety of different formats. In tandem with the facility upgrade, the Grains and Foods Group entered into a three-year packaging agreement with a global consumer products company to produce aseptically processed and packaged natural broth products. On January 27, 2010, we announced an environmentally responsible energy recovery project at our Cambridge, Minnesota oat fiber facility within our Ingredients Group. The project involves the extraction of methane from the digestion of waste-water resulting from the oat fiber production process, and subsequent conversion of that methane into pipeline quality natural gas used to help power the facility. This project was commissioned during the year and significantly reduced the amount of greenhouse gases and various waste materials emitted from the facility, as well as provided an acceptable return on invested capital as a result of lower utility expenses. GRAINS AND FOODS GROUP Operations and Product offerings  Grains and Foods Group The Grains and Foods Group is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It specializes in marketing organic, identity preserved (IP), and non-genetically modified organism (GMO) grains, ingredients, packaged goods and processing services with a core focus on soybean, sunflower and corn products. The Grains and Foods Group ensures that it provides its customers with high quality organic, non-GMO and IP specialty grains and seeds by serving as a growers supplier of seed, purchaser of the growers specialty crops and distributor of IP and organic specialty products. We believe this seed to table approach allows the Grains and Foods Group to meet the specific needs of domestic and foreign food manufacturers and processors by providing products in the varieties and quantities needed in a timely fashion; transporting products to meet customers needs by being able to package in containers, truck, rail or barge; providing product information and technical support during the growing, processing, and marketing phases; and offering complete product service including grading, formulation, processing, quality control and packaging. The Grains and Foods Groups products include: 1) A wide variety of IP, non-GMO and organic seeds and whole grains including soy, corn and sunflower for food applications offering premium varieties with superior food quality. The vertically integrated model results in control at every stage of production, from seed selection and growing to storage, processing and transportation. 2) Organic, non-GMO and IP grains based ingredients, including: Raw material sourcing and processing of soy based ingredients in liquid, spray-dried and roasted formats. SUNOPTA INC. 8 January 1, 2011 10-K Grain-based ingredients which utilize non-GMO and organic soy, corn, sunflower and rice; specialty organic functional ingredients including maltodextrins, tack blends, fiber products, flavor enhancing products including snack coatings, cheese powders and flavor systems, an innovative line of organic dairy ingredients and organic soy and sunflower oils. 3) A variety of packaged food products for retail and foodservice use, including: A wide variety of private label packaged products for a large number of retailers and consumer food companies, including aseptic and refrigerated soymilk, rice, almond and other alternate beverages; aseptic broths and soups; frozen edamame and vegetable blends; and roasted grain based snacks. Branded food products under the Sunrich Naturals brand, including: Alternative beverages  a variety of soy, rice, almond and sunflower based beverages for retail and foodservice. Frozen vegetables  a variety of frozen edamame and vegetable blends for health food stores, foodservice operators and retail outlets. Roasted grains-based snacks  specializing in providing healthy, natural and organic snacks to schools, daycare centers, retailers and healthcare facilities throughout North America. Products include in-shell sunflower and sunflower kernels, roasted corn and soy snacks. 4) A full range of bulk grain-based animal feed and pet food products. The premium feed products originate from select organic and non-GMO soy, corn, sunflower and other grains. The Grains and Foods Group also engages in processing and contract manufacturing services and offers a comprehensive range of services including basic grain cleaning, ingredient processing, custom roasting, and retail-ready packaging. With over 14 processing facilities throughout the United States plus a number of storage and office facilities, it can handle a range of order sizes, including barge lots, rail cars, bags, pallets, and retail packages. The Grains and Food Group services include: Grain conditioning services for soy, corn and sunflower. The Grains and Foods Groups advanced equipment and state-of-the-art technology for scalping and foreign matter removal is engineered to meet USDA Grain Standards for premium food grade seed and grain conditioning. Grain milling for corn, oat and grain processing, with various granulations and batch sizing. Ingredient processing expertise and equipment needed for extraction, separation and concentration of a wide variety of grains-based and dairy ingredients. Liquid packaging through its aseptic packaging facilities, specializing in Tetra Pak equipment in a variety of pack sizes and offering a variety of opening types and extended shelf life options. The Grains and Foods group also partners with third party fillers to provide extended shelf life (ESL) refrigerated packaging formats to its customers. Grains roasting and packaging through extensive facilities offering a wide range of consumer and bulk packaging. CompetitionGrains and Foods Group The Grains and Foods Group competes with large grain suppliers for customers and competes with other companies active on the international commercial grain procurement market for supply. The Grains and Foods Groups organic specialty grains compete in the smaller niche U.S. commercial organic grains market. Key to competing in these markets is access to transportation, supply and relationships with producers. The Grains and Foods Groups aseptic and roasted packaged products facilities compete with a number of other regional manufacturers and ingredient offerings compete with a range of suppliers from small local companies through large multi-nationals. SUNOPTA INC. 9 January 1, 2011 10-K Distribution, Marketing, and SalesGrains and Foods Group The Grains and Foods Group has well established sales and marketing capabilities that have provided a base for its operations. As a leading provider of soy, corn, sunflower and grain-based food ingredients, it offers a comprehensive range of ingredients and services to the food industry. Distribution channels can vary greatly by product category, but the Grains and Foods Group enjoys a diverse to market strategy in each product category. The Grains and Foods Groups Organic, non-GMO and IP ingredients are sold to manufacturers worldwide. For specialty whole grain raw materials, approximately 50% of the customer base is international. Food ingredients are sold principally to customers in North America that range from major multi-nationals to smaller specialty innovative organic food makers, but is expanding geographically as the South African soy processing venture opens new international markets. The consumer goods distribution channels include private label and store brands, food service and also SunOpta-controlled brands. This wide array of sales and distribution avenues is expected to allow the Grains and Foods Group to maximize sales and margin while mitigating the risk of concentrating business in a single segment of the market. SuppliersGrains and Foods Group The Grains and Foods Group has an extensive established IP, organic soy and corn grower network with approximately 2,500 producers, with many relationships existing for over 25 years, and relationships with approximately 1,000 sunflower farmers in the Midwest and southern U.S. Because weather conditions and other factors can limit the availability of certain grains in North America, our Grains and Foods Group is focused on expanding production and sourcing capabilities to other parts of the world in hand with the International Foods Group to ensure supply in years when local production is below normal levels. By diversifying supply, it also has the ability to divert available product based on market demand and customer requirements in order to maximize return. INGREDIENTS GROUP Operations and Product Offerings  Ingredients Group The Ingredients Group is headquartered in Chelmsford, Massachusetts and operates from five processing facilities throughout the United States. It transforms both internally and externally sourced raw materials into value-added food ingredient solutions with a core focus on oat and soy fiber. The Ingredients Group is comprised of the previously acquired Northern Food & Dairys Fosston, Minnesota facility, Opta Food Ingredients, Inc., and the Cedar Rapids, Iowa oat fiber facility purchased in 2005 from General Mills. The Ingredients Group specializes in the technical processing of specialty food ingredients with a focus on non-GMO, natural, functional and organic offerings. It works closely with customers to identify product formulation, cost and productivity issues, and develops solutions to these problems based on proprietary, value-added, highly functional food ingredients and ingredient systems that use the Ingredients Groups technical knowledge and manufacturing base. The Ingredients Group is an innovator in the value-added food ingredients market with a technical selling and product applications focus. Based on our internal estimates, the Ingredients Group is the worlds largest supplier of oat fiber to the food industry, one of the largest producers of soy fiber in the United States and the largest producer of organic soy fiber in the United States. The Ingredients Group markets the Canadian Harvest ® Oat Fiber, SunOpta Soy Fibers, and SunOpta Pea Fiber brands of insoluble organic and conventional fiber products, Barley Balance soluble fiber, MultiFiber blends, SunOpta Soy Fiber blends, a number of value-added starch-based texturizers and proprietary stabilizer blends under the SunOpta Ingredient SystemsTM umbrella, and a number of custom processed ingredients including natural preservatives. SUNOPTA INC. 10 January 1, 2011 10-K The Ingredients Group continues to diversify its unique portfolio of products. Products are organized under three main technology platforms: 1) Fibers and Brans, including Canadian Harvest Oat Fibers and Stabilized Bran products as well as SunOpta Soy and Pea Fibers. Canadian Harvest Oat Fibers and SunOpta Soy and Pea Fibers are a family of insoluble fiber products derived from oat, soy and pea hulls. They are used commercially to increase the fiber content of cereals, breads, cookies and crackers to increase yield and enhance texture in ground meat products and to add strength and reduce breakage in products such as taco shells and ice cream cones. The Group also provides highly functional fiber blends for specific applications under the Multifiber brand name and a lineup of soy fiber blends. We also offer Canadian Harvest Stabilized Brans derived from oat, wheat and corn, as well as wheat germ. The Stabilized Brans are heat-treated to extend shelf life and ground to meet customer needs for appropriate particle size. One of our unique soy fibers is a protein and fiber rich by-product of soy concentrate manufacturing. This fiber is used to enrich protein and fiber for a variety of foods for human consumption plus animal feed and pet foods. 2) SunOptatm Ingredient Systems, including OptaGrade®, OptaMist®, and a portfolio of value added ingredient systems for the bakery, dairy, and meat industries. OptaGrade is a natural, starch-based texturizing agent that is used commercially in a variety of dairy products including natural, imitation, and processed cheeses, sour cream, cream cheese, and cottage cheese. OptaMist is also a starch-based texturizing agent that improves the taste, texture and appearance of dairy products, yogurt, cheese products, and salad dressings. 3) Custom ingredients and contract manufacturing services. We produce a number of unique functional food ingredients, and offer services to customers on a contract basis utilizing proprietary technologies. We believe the Ingredients Group is well positioned to capitalize on the rapid growth of the health conscious natural and organic food markets, with its wide range of fiber, brans and starch-based products. Publications from both the American Dietetic Association and a Mayo Clinic Health letter note that fiber consumption is still below recommended levels in the U.S. The Canadian Harvest line of oat fibers and stabilized brans and SunOpta Soy and Pea Fibers and fiber blends are used in numerous products such as fiber-enriched breads and other baked goods, breakfast cereals and snack bars. These products can be used to increase total dietary fiber content of foods while minimizing negative effects on taste, texture and appearance. The Ingredients Groups insoluble oat, soy and pea fibers enhance overall gastrointestinal health. Oat and soy fibers have become primary ingredients in breads, pastries, muffins, tacos and tortillas as food companies reformulate their products to include fiber-enriched ingredients. Recent innovations have expanded applications of fiber into dairy and meat products. Stabilized oat brans can be used as a source of soluble fiber (β-glucan) which is beneficial to cardiovascular health. Our food ingredients are used by approximately 300 customers worldwide, including some of the largest U.S. consumer packaged food companies and quick service restaurant chains. The Ingredients Groups product offering is sold internationally via approximately 25 distributors around the world. Many of our starch-based texturizers and ingredient blends were originally developed for and are used in reduced fat versions of a variety of dairy products such as low fat or fat-free cottage cheese, sour cream, cream cheese, or processed cheeses. As discussed in Taking the Fat Out of Food, a publication of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), reducing fat intake by consuming reduced fat versions of these products is an element of a healthier diet. In addition to helping food manufacturers improve the healthfulness of their food products, the ingredients can be used to improve the overall quality of food products, reduce formulation costs, and meet specific processing requirements. We believe that all of our products are Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) under current FDA regulations (see Regulation  SunOpta Foods, below). The Ingredients Group markets a portfolio of functional fibers including organic and conventional pea fiber via a distribution agreement with Best Cooking Pulses of Portage la Prairie, Canada. The production of pea fiber is highly sustainable, non-allergenic, non-GMO, and gluten free. It is approved by Health Canada as a novel fiber for inclusion in bakery and meat products. The Ingredients Group also represents Polycell Technologies to market and sell Barley Balance beta-glucan concentrate. Barley Balance is the most concentrated source of barley beta-glucan soluble fiber produced by a natural and sustainable process. Barley Balance contains a minimum of 25% beta-glucan and over 35% dietary fiber adding excellent nutritional benefits and functional performance to food and beverage products. SUNOPTA INC. 11 January 1, 2011 10-K Over the last 18 months, the Ingredients Group has launched a line of new products under the MultiFiber brand name. Internally developed, MultiFiber products are highly functional blends of fibers that meet the needs of customers who are looking for a cost effective, easy-to-source fiber for fortification while meeting specific textural goals. All MultiFiber products deliver a concentrated source of dietary fiber with a smooth texture and bland flavor. These new and innovative ingredients are expected to provide value for food and beverage manufacturers who are looking for ratios of soluble and insoluble fibers similar to what occurs naturally in foods. CompetitionIngredients Group Food ingredients are considered unique niche items usually developed or processed for specific customers or industry segments. The Ingredients Group competes with other product developers and specialty processors for the specialty ingredient business. The food ingredients industry is very competitive. Competitors include major companies with food ingredient divisions, other food ingredient and sourcing companies, other insoluble and soluble fiber processors and consumer food companies that also engage in the development and sale of food ingredients. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources as well as production and marketing capabilities that are greater than ours. Distribution, Marketing, and SalesIngredients Group Sales and marketing is done through a technically oriented customer account team. We believe that the most effective way to solve each customers problem is to gain a thorough understanding of the customer at all levels, build solid working relationships throughout the customers organization, be knowledgeable of the market segment in which the customer competes, and have a detailed technical understanding of the customers needs as well as its preferred solution. We take a multidisciplinary approach to achieve this level of customer understanding and service. Members of the Ingredient Groups direct sales force are teamed up with the appropriate technical personnel to work as consultants in defining and developing a range of potential solutions to our customers formulation and product development needs. SuppliersIngredients Group The Ingredients Groups raw materials and packaging are sourced from approximately 65 suppliers with availability subject to world market conditions. There are a number of alternative sources of supply for all raw materials with critical supply relationships highlighted below. Oat and soy hulls are primarily sourced from major food companies or their brokers and there is adequate supply to meet current production requirements. Dairy ingredients are purchased primarily from dairy producer cooperatives. Products are purchased in the spot market with certain ingredients purchased under short-term supply contracts. Supply shortfalls would have an effect on availability and price and would be reflected in finished product pricing for the Ingredients Group. Certain other raw materials are supplied by processing customers and are not sourced directly from suppliers within SunOpta Foods. FRUIT GROUP Operations and Product Offerings  Fruit Group The Fruit Group is headquartered in Buena Park, California and focuses on providing natural and organic fruit and vegetable-based products to the private label retail, food service and industrial markets. The Fruit Group comprises two separate operating divisions: 1) Fruit Specialties which includes our frozen foods, fruit ingredients and brokerage operations, and 2) Healthy Snacks which includes our healthy fruit snacks division and the assets of the recently-acquired Edner of Nevada, Inc. We believe the Fruit Group is well positioned in the natural and organic frozen fruit and vegetable and healthy fruit and nutritional snack markets. The business has adjusted to profitability pressures through the rationalization of operations, product mix and go-to-market strategies which has provided increased processing flexibility and a reduced cost base along with the implementation of internal cost improvement initiatives. Our global sourcing and production capabilities, coupled with extensive product development expertise is expected to provide a solid platform for future growth. SUNOPTA INC. 12 January 1, 2011 10-K We estimate that the Fruit Group is the largest supplier of organic individually quick-frozen fruit to the private label retail market in the United States, and the largest supplier of natural and organic private label fruit snacks in the United States, providing its customers with a wide range of products including bulk raw materials, value-added ingredients and retail solutions. It services over 500 customers, including food manufacturers, food service distributors, quick-service and casual dining restaurants and retail companies located principally in North America and Asia. The Fruit Groups two divisions are described below. Fruit Specialties Division. The Fruit Specialties division consists of both fruit processing and fruit ingredient operations. The fruit processing operations consist of facilities with processing and packaging capabilities, as well as sourcing and trading capabilities provided by our food brokerage operation. This division processes strawberries, peaches, mangos and other fruits and vegetables, and packs natural and organic frozen fruits and vegetables for the private label retail, food service, and industrial ingredient markets. It sources fruits, berries, and vegetables from various growing regions throughout the United States, Mexico and other fruit growing regions around the world, and processes the material into individually quick-frozen, block frozen, strawberry sugar packs and purees to meet our customers technical specifications. Fruit Specialties supplies frozen fruit products to the private label retail, food service and industrial markets, including food manufacturers and quick service and casual dining restaurants. Our poly-bag packaging operations in Buena Park, California provide retail customers with a wide range of private label natural and organic frozen fruits and vegetables, including strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, peaches, mangos, tropical fruit, green garbanzos and many other items. We operate three berry processing facilities located in Buena Park, California, and Rosarito and Irapuato, Mexico. We have ceased fresh strawberry processing at our Buena Park facility and are focusing efforts on our poly-bag operations for the retail market. We have idled our Mexican operations for 2011, and are assessing strategic options for these facilities. Pacific Fruit Processors, located in South Gate, California produces a range of value-added fruit ingredients in aseptic and conventional formats for sale to food manufacturers, restaurants and food service operations. Raw materials consist primarily of strawberries, peaches, pineapples, mangos, honeydew melons, cantaloupes, and other fruits. The Fruit Specialties division faces competition when securing the raw materials required to meet its needs; however, due to the location of our processing facilities, we are able to source raw materials from a number of growing regions and suppliers. We also source frozen fruits and vegetables from a number of domestic and worldwide growers, processors and traders, including our own International Foods Group. Healthy Snacks Division. The Healthy Snacks division produces natural and organic fruit snacks and nutritional bars. It operates processing facilities in Omak, Washington and Carson City, Nevada. During 2007 and 2008, fruit snack operations were significantly expanded at the Omak facility by adding capacity for an additional 140 million units per year, doubling through-put. In late 2010 the Group acquired the assets of Edner of Nevada, a producer of a wide range of nutritious portable foods such as nutrition bars. The primary raw material, apple, is sourced from local growers and internationally from our own International Foods Group. Production capabilities include a variety of fruit-based bar, twist, rope and bite size shapes, as well as the ability to add a variety of ingredients including fiber, plus a range of baked and extruded nutrition bars using a wide variety of ingredients including grains, sweeteners and other ingredients. The Healthy Snacks division has internal research and development capabilities to introduce innovative products to the marketplace. CompetitionFruit Group The fruit processing operations compete with strawberry processors primarily in California and Mexico and frozen fruit imports from Mexico, South America, Europe and Asia. The competitive landscape includes companies with financial resources larger than ours. In many cases, Mexican, South American, European and Asian competitors are able to achieve greater cost efficiencies due to lower relative costs of living and costs of supply in these regions. The location of our processing facilities in Mexico and California provides us with a diversified supply base for our customers due to extended supply seasonality. The fruit ingredient operations compete with regional and national food manufacturers, and face research and development competition from those same companies. A number of these competitors have production capabilities and financial resources that are greater than ours. SUNOPTA INC. 13 January 1, 2011 10-K The Healthy Snacks division has a smaller number of competitors, some of whom have production and technical capabilities and financial resources greater than ours. These competitors include independent fruit snack manufacturers, fruit snack divisions of larger food manufacturers and nutrition bar manufacturers. Distribution, Marketing and SalesFruit Group The fruit processing operations supply frozen fruit products to the private label retail, food service and industrial markets, including food manufacturers and quick service and casual dining restaurants. The fruit ingredient operations supply natural and organic value-added fruit ingredients to the dairy, food service and beverage industries. It offers fruit bases and preps for customers seeking high-quality, custom formulations to meet their special flavor and texture profiles. Applications include fruit for yogurts, ice creams, cheeses, smoothies, shakes, frozen desserts, bakery fillings, health bars, various beverages, dressings, marinades, dips and sauces. The fruit ingredient operations research and development team is integral to its reputable product quality and customer service. Manufacturing capabilities include aseptic and conventional processing and packaging. The Healthy Snacks division focuses on supplying natural and organic fruit snacks and nutrition bars to branded food companies and the private label retail markets and intends to expand distribution globally due to the portable nature of these products. SuppliersFruit Group The fruit processing operations source fresh and frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables from a large number of suppliers throughout California, Mexico and globally. The fruit ingredient operations primary raw materials are sourced from processors and traders of frozen fruits and vegetables, including our own International Foods and fruit processing operations, major sweetener producers, and a number of regional and national flavor companies. Availability of supplies is subject to world market conditions, including quantity and quality of supply. The Healthy Snacks divisions raw material suppliers include growers and traders of apples and apple concentrates and flavor companies, as well as processors and traders of fruit and grain products including our own International Foods Group. This division is subject to the availability of fruit and grains supply which is subject to conditions which may be beyond our control. INTERNATIONAL FOODS GROUP Operations and Product Offerings  International Foods Group The International Foods Group operations are centred in Santa Cruz, California, Amsterdam, the Netherlands and Acton, Ontario, Canada. It is comprised of SunOpta Food Solutions, The Organic Corporation and Purity Life Health Products. SunOpta Food Solutions utilizes its extensive sourcing and product development expertise to produce a range of product solutions for the private label retail and food service markets. The Organic Corporation operates a factory in Dalian, China that supplies food grade organic soybeans and feed, organic sunflower kernels and other grains, sourcing and processing operations in Ethiopia for organic coffee and organic sesame seeds, plus a number of global sourcing and trading operations. The groups natural health products operation, Purity Life Health Products, maintains processing and packaging facilities in Brantford, Ontario and Rockwood, Ontario and warehousing operations in Acton, Ontario and Vancouver, British Columbia. The International Foods Group sources raw material ingredients from approximately 60 countries around the world, and, in our estimation, is the largest supplier of a wide range of organic commodities to the food industry in the European, North American and Asian markets. SUNOPTA INC. 14 January 1, 2011 10-K The International Foods Group provides organic food solutions to major global food manufacturers and distributors, and major U.S. supermarket chains with a variety of industrial and private label retail products. It sources or produces organic fruit and vegetable-based ingredients, sweeteners, cocoa, coffee, grains, nuts, seeds and pulses and other organic food products from virtually every continent and in both hemispheres to ensure quality of supply, minimize crop risk and provide contra-seasonal solutions to our customers. In many cases, we will enter into exclusive arrangements with growers and/or processors of key strategic commodities to control the reliability of our supply chain. Utilizing a number of strategic and/or exclusive co-pack relationships and an experienced research and development team, we are able to provide our retail customers, distributors and food service operators with organic private label turn-key solutions in a variety of product categories, including juices, frozen fruits and vegetables, specialty beverages, vitamin waters, electrolyte waters, energy drinks, soups and tomato products. Our Canadian-based natural health products division distributes approximately 5,500 SKUs of natural vitamins, supplements and health and beauty aids, many of which are formulated, processed and packaged within our vertically integrated manufacturing operations and sold under company owned brands including Herbon, Vivitas, Natures Harmony and Quest. CompetitionInternational Foods Group The organic food industry is very competitive due primarily to the limited worldwide supply of organic raw materials. Our competitors in the supply of industrial ingredients include domestic and worldwide brokers, traders and food processors. In the private label retail market, competitors include major food manufacturing companies, some of which have production and technical capabilities more extensive than ours. Our natural health products division competes against much larger conventional distributors; however, we believe that we are Canadas largest distributor of natural health products. We also compete with a handful of national distributors and a diverse group of much smaller regional distributors. Distribution, Marketing and SalesInternational Foods Group The International Foods Group operates administrative, research and development offices in Santa Cruz, California, Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Acton, Ontario. Sales and marketing is conducted through technically oriented sales teams strategically located close to specific geographic sourcing and/or sales regions. The International Foods Group maintains one of the largest global sourcing and supply networks in the world, working closely to manage global organic supply and link these supplies with diverse customer needs and also provides procurement support for other SunOpta operations. We believe our natural health products division is the largest distributor of natural health products in Canada. SuppliersInternational Foods Group The International Foods Groups raw material suppliers include growers, processors and traders of organic fruit and vegetable-based ingredients, sweeteners and other food products. Raw materials are sourced from growing regions worldwide, including North America, South America, Central America, Europe, Africa and Asia. Organic food suppliers are required to meet stringent organic certification requirements equivalent to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Organic Program, European Union standards or others. Our natural health products division sources product from approximately 175 suppliers, primarily in North America. Regulation  SunOpta Foods SunOpta Foods is affected by a wide range of governmental regulations and policies in various countries and regions where we operate, including the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, and throughout the rest of the European Union. These laws, regulations and policies are implemented, as applicable in each jurisdiction, on the national, federal, state, provincial and local levels. For example, SunOpta Foods is affected by laws and regulations related to: seed, fertilizer and pesticides; the purchasing, harvesting, transportation and warehousing of grain and other products; the processing, packaging and sale of food, including wholesale operations; and product labelling and marketing, food safety and food defence. SunOpta Foods is also affected by government-sponsored price supports, acreage set aside programs and a number of environmental regulations. SUNOPTA INC. 15 January 1, 2011 10-K U.S. Regulations USDA National Organic Program and Similar Regulations SunOpta Foods is involved in the sourcing, manufacturing, supplying, processing, marketing, selling and distribution of organic seed and food products and, as such, is subject to certain organic quality assurance standards. In December 2000, the USDA adopted regulations with respect to a national organic labelling and certification program which became fully effective in October 2002. These regulations, among other things, set forth the minimum standards producers must meet in order to have their products labelled as certified organic. We currently manufacture and distribute a number of organic products that are covered by these regulations. Additionally, our organic products may be subject to U.S. various state regulations. Applicable regulatory agencies in the United States include the USDA, which monitors both the organic process and agricultural grain business, and the FDA and Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversee the safety, security and efficacy of the food supply in the United States. FDA GRAS Certain food ingredients are regulated under the 1958 Food Additive Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (FDCA) as administered by the FDA. Pre-marketing approval by the FDA is required for the sale of a food additive unless we believe the substance is generally regarded as safe (GRAS) under FDA standards. A food additive is a substance, the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, either in their becoming a component of food or otherwise affecting the characteristics of food. Such pre-marketing approval for ingredients that are not GRAS, which is issued in the form of formal regulation, requires demonstrating that both the food ingredient is safe under its intended conditions of use, and that it achieves the function for which it is intended. Companies may establish GRAS status through self-affirmation whereby the producer determines on its own that the ingredient is GRAS, normally with the assistance of a panel of qualified experts. The producer may also voluntarily submit a GRAS Notification to the FDA that includes the products description, conditions of use, and the basis for GRAS determination, among other information. The FDA response, typically within 180 days, to a GRAS notice is not an approval and the product may be marketed while the FDA is reviewing the information. A food ingredient is eligible for GRAS classification based on the views of experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of the product. The experts views are either based on scientific procedures or through experience based on common use of the material prior to 1958. If based on scientific procedures they must use the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as would be required for the FDA to issue a pre-market approval of the sale of a food additive. If a food ingredient is not entitled to GRAS status, pre-market approval must be sought through the filing of a Food Additive Petition. Many of SunOpta Foods products are being marketed pursuant to GRAS self-affirmation. We believe that a majority of products for which we have retained commercial rights are GRAS. However, such status cannot be determined until actual formulations and uses are finalized. Thereafter, we decide whether self-affirmation procedures and a GRAS notification will be appropriate. For those components that do not qualify for GRAS, we may be required to file a Food Additive Petition. In the event that a petition is required, we may elect to sell or license its rights to manufacture, market, and distribute the component to another party. Other U.S. Environmental, Food Safety and Food Labelling Regulations SunOpta Foods is also subject to various U.S., state and local environmental regulations. Some of the key environmental regulations in the U.S. include but are not limited to the following. Air Quality Regulations. Air quality is regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and certain city/state air pollution control groups. Emission reports are filed annually. Waste Treatment/Disposal Regulations. Solid waste is either disposed of by a third-party or, in some cases, we have a permit to haul and apply the sludge to land. Agreements exist with local city sewer districts to treat waste at specified levels of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and other constituents. This can require weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection. There are specific regulations governing the recycling of solid waste material regulated by the Ministry of Environment and Energy and the Commonwealth of Virginia, Department of Environmental Quality. SUNOPTA INC. 16 January 1, 2011 10-K Sewer Regulations. We have agreements with the local city sewer districts to treat waste at specified limits of BOD and TSS. This requires weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection. Hazardous Chemicals Regulations. Various reports are filed with local city/state emergency response agencies to identify potential hazardous chemicals being used in our facilities, including reports filed with the Department of Public Safety Emergency Response Commission in Minnesota and the Kentucky Emergency Response Commission. Storm Water. All facilities are inspected annually and must comply with an approved storm water plan to protect water supplies. Bioterrorism Compliance. We are currently subject to the four recognized and approved sections of the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. SunOpta Foods is also subject to various other U.S., state and local food safety and food labeling regulations. Some of the key food safety and food labeling regulations in the U.S. include but are not limited to the following, in addition to those described above. Food Safety and Food Defense. In 2011, the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) became effective significantly expanding the authority of the FDA and imposing new regulation of food production, sales and imports. Much uncertainty remains concerning how FSMA will be implemented by FSDA. No rulemaking has yet occurred concerning any of the provisions in FSMA. Food Labeling. We are subject to certain requirements for food labeling under the FDCA. Other state and local statutes and regulations may impose additional food labeling requirements. For instance, the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (commonly referred to as Proposition 65) requires, with a few exceptions, that a specific warning appear on any consumer product sold in the State of California that contains a substance, above certain levels, listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. This law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products. FTC Enforcement. The FTC retains jurisdiction over marketing and labeling of food products. For example, the FTC has recently released its revised Green Guides for the marketing of eco-friendly products. Canadian and Other Non-U.S. Regulations Countries other than the U.S. also regulate the sale of food ingredients or characterize food ingredients differently. Vitamin and minerals supplements in the U.S. are regulated pursuant to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, which regulates these products as foods. Regulations vary substantially from country to country, and we take appropriate steps to comply with such regulations. In Canada, the sale of food, natural health products (NHPs), drugs, and cosmetics are regulated under various federal and provincial laws, but are principally regulated federally under Canadas Food and Drugs Act, Canada Agricultural Products Act, and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA) and supporting regulations. Some of the key regulations in Canada include but are not limited to the following: Natural Health Products Regulations: Natural health products are regulated by Health Canada. In 2004, Health Canada published a compliance policy and guide which had the practical effect of temporarily relaxing enforcement of the NHP Regulations to assist regulated parties to become compliant. This relaxation of enforcement is expected to end some time during 2011. However, the Unprocessed Product Licence Applications Regulations (UPLAR) came into force in August 2011 and provides a legal framework for NHPs to obtain an exemption from the Natural Health Products Regulations while a product licence application is in process. UPLAR is set to be repealed in February 2013, by which time full compliance with the NHP Regulations will likely be required for all NHPs without any possibility of an exemption. Food and Drug Regulations: Food and drugs are subject to specific regulatory requirements, which include without limitation, composition, (including without limitation food additives, fortification, and food standards), packaging, labelling, advertising and marketing, and licencing requirements. SUNOPTA INC. 17 January 1, 2011 10-K Cosmetic Regulations: Cosmetics are subject to composition and labelling requirements. We must also file cosmetic notification forms, a post-marketing requirement for those cosmetics manufactured in Canada and a pre-market requirement for those products imported into Canada. Health Canada also publishes a Hot List of cosmetic ingredients it deems unsafe in cosmetics. Organic Products Regulations: As of June 30, 2009, the Organic Products Regulations require mandatory certification to the revised National Organic Standard for agricultural products to be represented as organic in international and interprovincial trade, or that bear the federal organic agricultural product legend (or federal logo). But for certain exceptions and conditions, there is currently a U.S.-Canadian equivalence arrangement, whereby agricultural product produced and processed in conformity with the United States Organic Foods Production Act and the National Organic Program Regulations is deemed to have been produced and processed in accordance with the Organic Products Regulations. Waste Treatment/Disposal Regulations: There are specific regulations governing the recycling of solid waste material regulated by various Provincial regulatory agencies. Many of the Provinces operate stewardship programs for consumer product waste, as well as hazardous or special waste. These waste diversion programs require that the brand owner or a first importer of the designated materials to register, file reports on the materials it supplies for sale or use in the provincial market and remit fees under the stewardship program. Substance Regulations: Various regulations under CEPA regulate the importation and use of certain substances in Canada. For example, prior to the importation and use in products, the importer must ensure that all ingredients are found on the Domestic Substances List (DSL) maintained by Environment Canada. In the event that an ingredient is not found on the DSL, then subject to the amount of the substance imported into Canada and used in products sold in Canada, a filing may become necessary under the New Substances Notification Regulations. In addition, the Canadian Government has undertaken a review of ingredients used in commerce for regulated products we sell, with a view of determining whether the use of certain ingredients in these products represent a risk to the environment. This could eventually lead to the removal of certain ingredients in Canada. Canada Consumer Product Safety Act: This Act is expected to come into force on June 20, 2011. This Act and its regulations will provide greater oversight and regulation of consumer products with respect to manufacturers, importers, and retailers. It will include, without limitation, the ability to require product recalls, mandatory incident reporting, document retention requirements, increased fines and penalties, and packaging and labeling requirements. While the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act will not apply to food, drugs, or natural health products, it is expected that there will be similar amendments introduced to the Food and Drugs Act, to capture the essence of the regulatory oversight found in the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act. All of SunOpta Foods Canadian manufacturing facilities and warehouses are registered with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), which monitors food processing and safety in Canada, and/or Health Canada. All of SunOpta Foods Canadian import sites for drug and natural health products are licenced with Health Canada to import such products (Site Licence for natural health products and Establishment Licence for drugs). All imported materials are shipped in compliance with the notification systems that alert the FDA, Health Canada, the CFIA and customs before the materials enter the country. We are confident that we have the necessary processes and controls in place that provide for an additional level of traceability of all raw materials from the supplier to the immediate subsequent recipient of the finished products. We also recognize and believe that we have the necessary programs to administer a product recall as may be required. As a result of our acquisition of The Organic Corporation headquartered in the Netherlands, we are now subject to Dutch and European Commission (EC) regulations and policies. The Organic Corporation is involved in the sourcing, supplying, marketing, selling and distribution of organic food products and, as such, is subject to standards for production, labeling and inspection of organic products contained in EC Regulation 2092/91 (and its subsequent amendments). The Organic Corporation is certified by SKAL, the inspection body for the production of organic products in the Netherlands. Products certified as organic by a European Union recognized inspection body, such as SKAL, an organization that certifies organic products in the Netherlands, can be marketed within the entire European Union. The Organic Corporation is also affected by general food legislation both at a European Union and Dutch level relating to product safety and hygiene, among others. The Organic Corporation is Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) certified in the Netherlands and manages a fully computerized system that guarantees the traceability of each product. In addition, The Organic Corporation also considers and abides by European Union and local legislation with regard to packaging and packaging waste. SUNOPTA INC. 18 January 1, 2011 10-K Research and Development  SunOpta Foods Research and development and new product innovation are key priorities of SunOpta Foods and initiatives are focused on continuous improvement of our existing product portfolios and production processes as well as the development of innovative new products. Innovation is a key pillar for us and a necessity in the natural and organic foods and natural health product categories. SunOpta Foods extensive applications and research and development expertise is organized around five key product categories: Grains and grain-based ingredients through finished packaged products; Value-added ingredients focused on fiber based applications; Fruit, juices and fruit-based ingredients through finished packaged products; Value-added nutritious healthy snacks and portable foods; and Natural health products sold via certain owned brands within Purity Life. Our product development teams include highly trained and experienced food scientists and technologists that are dedicated to both the development of unique new product offerings plus addressing product development opportunities for our customers including new and custom formulations, innovations in packaging formats, and new production processes and applications. Applications and technical support provided by each of our operating groups to our customers include all aspects of product development from concept to commercial launch as well as ongoing manufacturing and processing support. Representatives from our operating groups also meet regularly to coordinate efforts to develop products which leverage the talents and product capabilities from across our organization. SunOpta Foods continues to develop new products to maximize the capabilities of our aseptic packaging facilities in Modesto, California and Alexandria, Minnesota. In addition to new soy-based beverages, new products include beverages using alternative ingredients such as almonds and sunflower. These products address the growing consumer demand for non-dairy based beverages. In addition, we have developed products such as teas, broths, and soups. The expanding interest to incorporate soy and grain-based foods in consumers diets also creates numerous opportunities to develop ingredients that can be incorporated into food developers menu items. In addition, SunOpta Foods continues to expand its product portfolio via the addition of new fiber offerings that can be used with its oat-derived ingredients to improve the nutritional content and functionality of a variety of foods. Demand for food fibers has continued to grow and we believe that this is a long-term trend due to an increased focus on healthy foods. Many of our ingredient solutions can be used in products that aid in satiety to respond to the growing epidemic of obesity in North America and elsewhere. Many of our ingredients can also be used in products which qualify for a whole grain claim by augmenting the insoluble and soluble fiber content of foods. SunOpta Foods also continues to develop new fruit-based beverages, healthy fruit snacks as well as innovative fruit ingredient systems for the dairy, food service and beverage industries. We are also looking at using fiber and other ingredients in these fruit products to improve their ability to address satiety and lower glycemic indices. More recently, we have focused resources on developing new life stage, gender specific natural health products which address the different nutritional needs of men, women, boys and girls at different stages of life as well as new portable snack foods to address continued demand for on-the-go nutritional products. Intellectual Property  SunOpta Foods The nature of a number of SunOpta Foods products and processes requires that we create and maintain patents, trade secrets and trademarks. Our policy is to protect our technology, brands and trade names by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology relating to the development of our business in the U.S. and in selected foreign jurisdictions, and registering trademarks in the U.S., Canada and selected foreign jurisdictions where we sell products. SunOpta Foods success will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our products, trade names and technology under U.S. and international patent laws and other intellectual property laws. We believe that we own or have sufficient rights to use all of the proprietary technology, information and trademarks necessary to manufacture and market our products; however, there is always a risk that patent applications relating to our products or technologies will not result in patents being issued, or, if issued, will be later challenged by a third party, or that current or additional patents will not afford protection against competitors with similar technology. SUNOPTA INC. 19 January 1, 2011 10-K We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how and confidentiality agreements to protect certain technologies and processes. Even with these steps taken, our outside partners and contract manufacturers could gain access to our proprietary technology and confidential information. All employees are required to adhere to internal policies which are intended to further protect our technologies, processes and trade secrets. Employees  SunOpta Foods SunOpta Foods has approximately 1,595 full-time employees as of January 1, 2011. Aside from unions at our Mexican facilities in the Fruit Group and the International Foods Group, there are no other unions within SunOpta Foods. Properties  SunOpta Foods SunOpta Foods operates 29 processing facilities (16 owned, 13 leased) in ten U.S. states as well as Canada, Mexico, China and Ethiopia. SunOpta Foods also owns and leases a number of office and distribution locations and also leases and utilizes public warehouses to satisfy its storage needs. For more details see
