Item 1A. Risk Factors The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Our present and future revenues rely significantly on sales of products marketed and sold by others. Currently, our revenues rely significantly upon sales of RAPTIVA® and LUCENTIS®, in which we have only royalty interests. RAPTIVA® was approved by the FDA on October 27, 2003, for the treatment of chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Genentech and Serono, Genentechs international marketing partner for RAPTIVA®, are responsible for the marketing and sales effort in support of this product. In September of 2004, Serono announced that RAPTIVA® had received approval for use in the European Union and the product was launched in several European Union countries in the fourth quarter of 2004. In January of 2007, Merck KGaA acquired Serono and renamed the surviving entity Merck Serono S.A. We are evaluating the impact of this acquisition but do not yet know what effect it will have on sales of RAPTIVA®. LUCENTIS® was approved by the FDA on June 30, 2006, for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. Genentech and Novartis, Genentechs international marketing partner for LUCENTIS®, are responsible for the marketing and sales effort in support of this product. We have no role in marketing and sales efforts, and Genentech, Serono and Novartis do not have an express contractual obligation to us regarding the marketing or sales of RAPTIVA® or LUCENTIS®. Under our current arrangements with Genentech, we are entitled to receive royalties on worldwide sales of RAPTIVA® and LUCENTIS®. Successful commercialization of these products is subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to:  Genentechs and Seronos willingness and ability to implement their marketing and sales effort and achieve sales; 17 Table of Contents  the strength of competition from other products being marketed or developed to treat psoriasis;  the occurrence of adverse events which may give rise to safety concerns;  physicians and patients acceptance of RAPTIVA® as a treatment for psoriasis and LUCENTIS® as a treatment for age-related macular degeneration;  Genentechs ability to provide manufacturing capacity to meet demand for the products; and  pricing and reimbursement issues. According to Genentech, United States sales of RAPTIVA® during 2006 were $89.8 million, compared with $79.2 million and $52.4 million during 2005 and 2004, respectively. According to Serono, sales of RAPTIVA® outside of the United States during 2006 were $69.9 million, compared with $33.4 million and $3.9 million during 2005 and 2004, respectively. According to Genentech, United States sales of LUCENTIS® were $380.0 million and sales outside the United States were $27.0 million during 2006. LUCENTIS® sales began on June 30, 2006, upon its approval by regulatory agencies. Given our current reliance on RAPTIVA® and LUCENTIS® as principal sources of our revenues, any material adverse developments with respect to the commercialization of RAPTIVA® or LUCENTIS® may cause our revenues to decrease and may cause us to incur losses in the future. Because our products are still being developed, we will require substantial funds to continue; we cannot be certain that funds will be available and, if they are not available, we may have to take actions which could adversely affect your investment. If adequate funds are not available, we may have to raise additional funds in a manner that may dilute or otherwise adversely affect the rights of existing shareholders, curtail or cease operations, or file for bankruptcy protection in extreme circumstances. We have spent, and we expect to continue to spend, substantial funds in connection with:  research and development relating to our products and production technologies,  expansion of our production capabilities,  various human clinical trials, and  protection of our intellectual property. Based on current spending levels, anticipated revenues, collaborator funding, proceeds from our convertible note offerings in February of 2005 and February of 2006, our November 2006 term loan and other sources of funding we believe to be available, we estimate that we have sufficient cash resources to meet our anticipated net cash needs through at least 2008. Any significant revenue shortfalls, increases in planned spending on development programs or more rapid progress of development programs than anticipated, as well as the unavailability of anticipated sources of funding, could shorten this period. Progress or setbacks by potentially competing products may also affect our ability to raise new funding on acceptable terms. As a result, we do not know when or whether:  operations will generate meaningful funds,  additional agreements for product development funding can be reached,  strategic alliances can be negotiated, or  adequate additional financing will be available for us to finance our own development on acceptable terms, or at all. Cash balances and operating cash flow are influenced primarily by the timing and level of payments by our licensees and development partners, as well as by our operating costs. 18 Table of Contents Our level of leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition. As of December 31, 2006, we (including our subsidiaries) had approximately $98.2 million, including our embedded derivative, of indebtedness outstanding. We may not be able to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of, interest on and other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness when due. We and our subsidiaries may also incur additional debt that may be secured. In connection with our collaboration with Novartis, Novartis has extended a line of credit to us (through our U.S subsidiary) for $50.0 million to fund up to 75% of our expenses thereunder, of which $16.4 million was drawn as of December 31, 2006. This line of credit is secured by a pledge of our interest in the collaboration. On November 9, 2006, XOMA (US) LLC entered into a five-year, $35.0 million term loan facility with Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Holdings, Inc. (Goldman Sachs) and borrowed the full amount thereunder. The loan is guaranteed by XOMA and is secured by the payment rights due to XOMA (US) LLC relating to RAPTIVA®, LUCENTIS® and CIMZIA. As a result, these assets will not be available to XOMA or any other lender to secure future indebtedness. Our level of debt and debt service obligations could have important effects on us and our investors. These effects may include:  making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our convertible notes and our obligations to other persons with respect to our other debt;  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing financing at maturity on satisfactory terms to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt service requirements and other general corporate requirements;  increasing our vulnerability to general economic downturns, competition and industry conditions, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that are less leveraged;  increasing our exposure to rising interest rates to the extent any of our borrowings are at variable interest rates;  reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate requirements because we will be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to service debt obligations; and  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance and the availability of refinancing debt. If we are unable to service our debt and fund our business, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional debt financing or equity capital, restructure or refinance our debt or sell assets. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain additional financing, refinance existing debt or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all. Most of our therapeutic products have not received regulatory approval. If these products do not receive regulatory approval, neither our third party collaborators nor we will be able to manufacture and market them. Our products cannot be manufactured and marketed in the United States and other countries without required regulatory approvals. The United States government and governments of other countries extensively regulate many aspects of our products, including:  testing,  manufacturing,  promotion and marketing, and  exporting. 19 Table of Contents In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. At the present time, we believe that most of our products will be regulated by the FDA as biologics. Changes in the regulatory approval policy during the development period, changes in, or the enactment of, additional regulations or statutes or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Even if the FDA or other regulatory agency approves a product candidate, the approval may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use, labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and/or production of such product. Even for approved products such as RAPTIVA® and LUCENTIS®, the FDA may impose ongoing requirements for post-approval studies, including additional research and development and clinical trials, and may subsequently withdraw approval based on these additional trials. The FDA and other agencies also may impose various civil or criminal sanctions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, including withdrawal of product approval. State regulations may also affect our proposed products. The FDA has substantial discretion in both the product approval process and manufacturing facility approval process and, as a result of this discretion and uncertainties about outcomes of testing, we cannot predict at what point, or whether, the FDA will be satisfied with our or our collaborators submissions or whether the FDA will raise questions which may be material and delay or preclude product approval or manufacturing facility approval. As we accumulate additional clinical data, we will submit it to the FDA, which may have a material impact on the FDA product approval process. We face uncertain results of clinical trials of our potential products. Our potential products will require significant additional research and development, extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials and regulatory approval prior to any commercial sales. This process is lengthy and expensive, often taking a number of years. As clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals, the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly. As a result, it is uncertain whether:  our future filings will be delayed,  our preclinical and clinical studies will be successful,  we will be successful in generating viable product candidates to targets,  we will be able to provide necessary additional data,  results of future clinical trials will justify further development, or  we will ultimately achieve regulatory approval for any of these products. For example,  In 1996, in conjunction with Genentech, we began testing RAPTIVA® in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. In April of 2002, we announced with Genentech that a pharmacokinetic study conducted on RAPTIVA® comparing XOMA-produced material and Genentech-produced material did not achieve the pre-defined statistical definition of comparability, and the FDA requested that another Phase III study be completed before the filing of a Biologics License Application for RAPTIVA®, delaying the filing beyond the previously-planned time frame of the summer of 2002. In March of 2003, we announced completion of enrollment in a Phase II study of RAPTIVA® in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. In May of 2003, Genentech and we announced our decision to terminate Phase II testing of RAPTIVA® in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis based on an evaluation by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board that suggested no overall net clinical benefit in patients receiving the study drug. We also completed enrollment in a Phase II study of RAPTIVA® as a possible treatment for patients with psoriatic arthritis. In March of 2004, we announced that the study did not reach statistical significance. 20 Table of Contents  In December of 1992, we began human testing of our NEUPREX® product, a genetically engineered fragment of a particular human protein, and licensed certain worldwide rights to Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Baxter) in January of 2000. In April of 2000, members of the FDA and representatives of XOMA and Baxter discussed results from the Phase III trial that tested NEUPREX® in pediatric patients with a potentially deadly bacterial infection called meningococcemia, and senior representatives of the FDA indicated that the data presented were not sufficient to support the filing of an application for marketing approval at that time.  In 2003, we completed two Phase I trials of XMP.629, a BPI-derived topical peptide compound targeting acne, evaluating the safety, skin irritation and pharmacokinetics. In January of 2004, we announced the initiation of Phase II clinical testing in patients with mild-to-moderate acne. In August of 2004, we announced the results of a Phase II trial with XMP.629 gel. The results were inconclusive in terms of clinical benefit of XMP.629 compared with vehicle gel. Given that regulatory review is an interactive and continuous process, we maintain a policy of limiting announcements and comments upon the specific details of regulatory review of our products, subject to our obligations under the securities laws, until definitive action is taken. Because all of our products are still being developed, we have sustained losses in the past and we expect to sustain losses in the future. We have experienced significant losses and, as of December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated deficit of $727.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we had a net loss of approximately $51.8 million or $0.54 per common share (basic and diluted). For the year ended December 31, 2005, as a result of the restructuring of our Genentech arrangement and subsequent extinguishment of our obligation to pay $40.9 million under a development loan and related one-time credit to other income, we had net income of approximately $2.8 million or $0.03 per common share (basic and diluted). Our ability to achieve profitability is dependent in large part on the success of our development programs, obtaining regulatory approval for our products and entering into new agreements for product development, manufacturing and commercialization, all of which are uncertain. Our ability to fund our ongoing operations is dependent on the foregoing factors and on our ability to secure additional funds. Because our products are still being developed, we do not know whether we will ever achieve sustained profitability or whether cash flow from future operations will be sufficient to meet our needs. Our agreements with third parties, many of which are significant to our business, expose us to numerous risks. Our financial resources and our marketing experience and expertise are limited. Consequently, our ability to successfully develop products depends, to a large extent, upon securing the financial resources and/or marketing capabilities of third parties.  In April of 1996, we entered into an agreement with Genentech whereby we agreed to co-develop Genentechs humanized monoclonal antibody product RAPTIVA®. In April of 1999, March of 2003, and January of 2005, the companies amended the agreement. In October of 2003, RAPTIVA® was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy and, in September of 2004, Serono announced the products approval in the European Union. In January of 2005, we entered into a restructuring of our collaboration agreement with Genentech which ended our existing cost and profit sharing arrangement related to RAPTIVA® in the United States and entitles us to a royalty interest on worldwide net sales. 21 Table of Contents  In November of 2001, we entered into a collaboration with Millennium to develop two of Millenniums products for certain vascular inflammation indications. In October of 2003, we announced that we had discontinued one of these products, MLN2201. In December of 2003, we announced the initiation of Phase I testing on the other product, MLN2222. As of May 2006, we completed the transfer of the data from the Phase I study to Millennium as per our amended agreement.  In March of 2004, we announced we had agreed to collaborate with Chiron Corporation (now Novartis) for the development and commercialization of antibody products for the treatment of cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, the companies will jointly research, develop, and commercialize multiple antibody product candidates. In April of 2005, we announced the initiation of clinical testing of the first product candidate out of the collaboration, HCD122, an anti-CD40 antibody, in patients with advanced CLL. In October of 2005, we announced the initiation of the second clinical trial of HCD122 in patients with multiple myeloma.  In October of 2004, we announced the licensing of our ING-1 product to Triton for use with their TNT System.  In March of 2005, we entered into a contract with NIAID to produce three monoclonal antibodies designed to protect United States citizens against the harmful effects botulinum neurotoxin of used in bioterrorism. In July of 2006, we entered into an additional contract with NIAID for the development of an appropriate formulation for human administration of these three antibodies in a single injection.  In June of 2005, we announced the formation of a collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize antibody drugs for certain targets discovered by Lexicon.  We have licensed our BCE technology, an enabling technology used to discover and screen, as well as develop and manufacture, recombinant antibodies and other proteins for commercial purposes, to over 45 companies. As of December 31, 2006, we were aware of one antibody product manufactured using this technology that has received FDA approval, Genentechs LUCENTIS® (ranibizumab injection) for treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration, and one antibody manufactured using this technology that is in late-stage clinical testing, UCBs CIMZIA (certolizumab pegol, CDP870) an anti-TNF alpha antibody fragment for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohns disease. Because our collaborators and licensees are independent third parties, they may be subject to different risks than we are and have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources they will apply. If these collaborators and licensees do not successfully develop and market these products, we may not have the capabilities, resources or rights to do so on our own. We do not know whether our collaborators or licensees will successfully develop and market any of the products that are or may become the subject of one of our collaboration or licensing arrangements. In particular, each of these arrangements provides for either sharing of collaboration expenses, which means that not only we but our collaborators must have sufficient available funds for the collaborations to continue, or funding solely by our collaborators or licensees. In addition, our collaboration with Novartis provides for funding by it in the form of a line of credit to us, and we cannot be certain that Novartis will provide the necessary funds available when we attempt to draw on the line of credit. Furthermore, our contracts with NIAID contain numerous standard terms and conditions provided for in the applicable federal acquisition regulations and customary in many government contracts. Uncertainty exists as to whether we will be able to comply with these terms and conditions in a timely manner, if at all. In addition, given our relative lack of experience in programs under contract with government agencies, we are uncertain as to the extent of NIAIDs demands and the flexibility that will be granted to us in meeting those demands. Lastly, CIMZIA (CDP870) has not received marketing approval from the FDA or any foreign governmental agency, and therefore we cannot assure you that it will prove to be safe and effective, will be approved for marketing or will be successfully commercialized. Even when we have a collaborative relationship, other circumstances may prevent it from resulting in successful development of marketable products.  In December of 2003, we agreed to collaborate with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) for the development and commercialization of an antibody to treat chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. 22 Table of Contents The TPO mimetic antibody was designed to mimic the activity of human thrombopoietin, a naturally occurring protein responsible for platelet production. In November of 2004, in conjunction with Alexion, we determined that the lead molecule in our TPO mimetic collaboration did not meet the criteria established in the program for continued development. In the first quarter of 2005, the companies determined not to continue with this development program and in the second quarter of 2005, the collaboration was terminated.  In November of 2004, we announced the licensing of our BPI product platform, including our NEUPREX® product, to Zephyr Sciences, Inc. In July of 2005, we announced our decision to terminate the license agreement with Zephyr due to Zephyr not meeting the financing requirements of the license agreement.  In September of 2004, we entered into a collaboration with Aphton for the treatment of gastrointestinal and other gastrin-sensitive cancers using anti-gastrin monoclonal antibodies. In January of 2006, Aphton announced that its common stock had been delisted from Nasdaq. In May of 2006, Aphton filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.  In September of 2005, we signed a letter agreement with Cubist to develop production processes and to manufacture a novel two-antibody biologic in quantities sufficient to conduct Phase III clinical trials. In July of 2006, Cubist announced that it had decided to cease investment in this product because of stringent FDA requirements for regulatory approval, and as a result we have terminated our letter agreement with Cubist. Although we continue to evaluate additional strategic alliances and potential partnerships, we do not know whether or when any such alliances or partnerships will be entered into. Certain of our technologies are relatively new and are in-licensed from third parties, so our capabilities using them are unproven and subject to additional risks. We license technologies from third parties. These technologies include but are not limited to phage display technologies licensed to us in connection with our BCE technology licensing program. However, our experience with some of these technologies remains relatively limited and, to varying degrees, we are still dependent on the licensing parties for training and technical support for these technologies. In addition, our use of these technologies is limited by certain contractual provisions in the licenses relating to them and, although we have obtained numerous licenses, intellectual property rights in the area of phage display are particularly complex. If the owners of the patent rights underlying the technologies we license do not properly maintain or enforce those patents, our competitive position and business prospects could be harmed. Our success will depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce our licensed intellectual property. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications to which we have licenses, or our licensors may fail to maintain existing patents. They may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents, or they may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would. Our licensors may also seek to terminate our license, which could cause us to lose the right to use the licensed intellectual property and adversely affect our ability to commercialize our technologies, products or services. Our share price may be volatile and there may not be an active trading market for our common shares. There can be no assurance that the market price of our common shares will not decline below its present market price or that there will be an active trading market for our common shares. The market prices of biotechnology companies have been and are likely to continue to be highly volatile. Fluctuations in our operating results and general market conditions for biotechnology stocks could have a significant impact on the volatility of our common share price. We have experienced significant volatility in the price of our common shares. From January 1, 2006 through March 5, 2007, our share price has ranged from a high of $3.50 to a low of $1.57. On March 5, 2007, the closing price of the common shares as reported on the Nasdaq National Market was $2.84 per share. Factors contributing to such volatility include, but are not limited to:  sales and estimated or forecasted sales of products, 23 Table of Contents  results of preclinical studies and clinical trials,  information relating to the safety or efficacy of products,  developments regarding regulatory filings,  announcements of new collaborations,  failure to enter into collaborations,  developments in existing collaborations,  our funding requirements and the terms of our financing arrangements,  technological innovations or new indications for our therapeutic products,  introduction of new products or technologies by us or our competitors,  government regulations,  developments in patent or other proprietary rights,  the number of shares issued and outstanding,  the number of shares trading on an average trading day,  announcements regarding other participants in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and  market speculation regarding any of the foregoing. We or our third party collaborators or licensees may not have adequate manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet market demand. Genentech is responsible for manufacturing or arranging for the manufacturing of commercial quantities of RAPTIVA® and LUCENTIS®. Should Genentech have difficulty in providing manufacturing capacity to produce these products in sufficient quantities, we do not know whether they will be able to meet market demand. If not, we will not realize revenues from the sales of these products. If any of our other products are approved, because we have never commercially introduced any pharmaceutical products, we do not know whether the capacity of our existing manufacturing facilities can be increased to produce sufficient quantities of our products to meet market demand. Also, if we or our third party collaborators or licensees need additional manufacturing facilities to meet market demand, we cannot predict that we will successfully obtain those facilities because we do not know whether they will be available on acceptable terms. In addition, any manufacturing facilities acquired or used to meet market demand must meet the FDAs quality assurance guidelines. We do not know whether there will be, or will continue to be, a viable market for the products in which we have an ownership or royalty interest. Although RAPTIVA® was approved in the United States in October of 2003 and in the European Union in 2004 and LUCENTIS® was approved in June of 2006 and in the European Union in January of 2007, their acceptance in the marketplace may not continue. Furthermore, even if other products in which we have an interest receive approval in the future, they may not be accepted in the marketplace. In addition, we or our collaborators or licensees may experience difficulties in launching new products, many of which are novel and based on technologies that are unfamiliar to the healthcare community. We have no assurance that healthcare providers and patients will accept such products, if developed. For example, physicians and/or patients may not accept a product for a particular indication because it has been biologically derived (and not discovered and developed by more traditional means) or if no biologically derived products are currently in widespread use in that indication. Similarly, physicians may not accept a product, such as RAPTIVA® or LUCENTIS®, if they believe other products to be more effective or are more comfortable prescribing other products. Safety concerns may also arise in the course of on-going clinical trials or patient treatment as a result of adverse events or reactions. 24 Table of Contents Furthermore, government agencies, as well as private organizations involved in healthcare, from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers and patients. Such guidelines or recommendations can be very influential and may adversely affect the usage of any products we may develop directly (for example, by recommending a decreased dosage of a product in conjunction with a concomitant therapy or a government entity withdrawing its recommendation to screen blood donations for certain viruses) or indirectly (for example, by recommending a competitive product over our product). Consequently, we do not know if physicians or patients will adopt or use our products for their approved indications. Products and technologies of other companies may render some or all of our products noncompetitive or obsolete. Developments by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive. Technologies developed and utilized by the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are continuously and substantially changing. Competition in the areas of genetically engineered DNA-based and antibody-based technologies is intense and expected to increase in the future as a number of established biotechnology firms and large chemical and pharmaceutical companies advance in these fields. Many of these competitors may be able to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to our own for many reasons, including that they may have:  significantly greater financial resources,  larger research and development and marketing staffs,  larger production facilities,  entered into arrangements with, or acquired, biotechnology companies to enhance their capabilities, or  extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials. These factors may enable others to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to our own or those of our collaborators. In addition, a significant amount of research in biotechnology is being carried out in universities and other non-profit research organizations. These entities are becoming increasingly interested in the commercial value of their work and may become more aggressive in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements. Furthermore, positive or negative developments in connection with a potentially competing product may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise additional funding on acceptable terms. For example, if another product is perceived to have a competitive advantage, or another products failure is perceived to increase the likelihood that our product will fail, then investors may choose not to invest in us on terms we would accept or at all. Without limiting the foregoing, we are aware that:  in April of 2004, Amgen Inc. and its partner Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, a division of Wyeth, announced that their rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis drug, Enbrel®, had been approved by the FDA for the same psoriasis indication as RAPTIVA® and, in September of 2004, they announced that the product received approval in the European Union in this same indication;  Abbott Laboratories has recently announced that it has successfully completed two Phase III psoriasis trials showing clinical benefits of its rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis drug Humira for the treatment of psoriasis. They indicated that they will submit regulatory applications in the United States and Europe in the first half of 2007;  In September of 2006, Centocor announced that its rheumatoid arthritis and Crohns disease drug, Remicade® (infliximab) had been approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with chronic severe (i.e. extensive and/or disabling) plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy and when other systemic therapies are medically less appropriate. This drug had already been approved to treat plaque psoriasis in the European Union, psoriatic arthritis in the United States and, in combination with methotrexate, in the European Union; 25 Table of Contents  Biogen sold its worldwide rights to Amevive®, which has been approved in the United States and Canada to treat the same psoriasis indication as RAPTIVA®, to Astellas Pharma US, Inc., in March of 2006;  Biogen and Fumapharm have taken their psoriasis-treating pill, BG-12 (dimethyl fumarate), through a Phase III trial in Germany in which, according to the companies, the product significantly reduced psoriasis symptoms in patients, and Biogen acquired Fumapharm in June of 2005. Biogen announced, in January of 2007, that it is initiating Phase III trials of BG-12 in multiple sclerosis;  Isotechnika, Inc. has completed a Canadian Phase III trial of ISA247, a trans-isomer of a cyclosporine analog, in 450 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, achieving all efficacy endpoints, as well as a Phase III extension trial, and has announced plans to conduct a 500-patient second Canadian/European phase III trial;  In February of 2007, UCB announced that it had completed a mid-stage clinical trial in psoriasis with positive results and that it was planning to start Phase III trials in the first half of 2007;  In February of 2007, Centocor announced positive results from a Phase II clinical trial in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of CNTO 1275, a fully-human monoclonal antibody that targets the cytokines interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23) and that the product is currently in Phase III clinical development in the same indication; and  other companies are developing monoclonal antibody or other products for treatment of inflammatory skin disorders. In addition to LUCENTIS®, there are two other FDA-approved therapies to treat macular degeneration: Pfizer, Inc.s and OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s Macugen® and Novartis and QLT Inc.s Visudyne®. It is also possible that LUCENTIS® will compete with Genentechs cancer drug Avastin®. There are several companies developing topical peptide treatments which may compete with XOMA 629 in acne. Migenix Inc. and its partner Cutanea Life Sciences, Inc. are developing CLS001 (formerly MBI 594AN) for roseasea, a topical peptide that has completed two Phase II trials for the treatment of acne. Helix Biomedix, Inc. is developing several peptide compounds. Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp. has rights to human derived antimicrobial peptides that may be developed for acne. In collaboration with Novartis, we are co-developing a humanized antibody to the target CD40, and, at the current time, there are several CD40-related programs under development, mostly focused on the development of CD40 ligand products. For example, SGN-40 is a humanized monoclonal antibody under development by Seattle Genetics, Inc. which is targeting CD40 antigen. Seattle Genetics is currently conducting a phase II clinical trial for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the most common type of aggressive non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and phase I trials for patients with multiple myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In January of 2007, Seattle Genetics entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Genentech to develop and commercialize SGN-40. Under the agreement, Genentech will fund future research, development, manufacturing and commercialization costs. In January of 2007, Kirin Brewery Company, Limited and Astellas Pharma Inc. announced that they have entered into a license and collaborative research and development agreement under which they will exclusively collaborate in developing and marketing a fully human anti-CD40 antagonistic monoclonal antibody worldwide with a first target indication of prophylaxis of organ rejection associated with organ transplantation. It is possible that other companies may be developing other products based on the same human protein as our NEUPREX® product, and these products may prove to be more effective than NEUPREX®. It is also possible that other companies may be developing other products based on the same therapeutic target as our XOMA 052 product and these products may prove to be more effective than XOMA 052. 26 Table of Contents Even if we or our third party collaborators or licensees bring products to market, we may be unable to effectively price our products or obtain adequate reimbursement for sales of our products, which would prevent our products from becoming profitable. If we or our third party collaborators or licensees succeed in bringing our product candidates to the market, they may not be considered cost-effective, and reimbursement to the patient may not be available or may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. In both the United States and elsewhere, sales of medical products and treatments are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement to the patient from third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services. Our business is affected by the efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of health care through various means. In the United States, there have been and will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement government controls on pricing. In addition, the emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products. We cannot predict whether any legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or the effect these proposals or managed care efforts may have on our business. If we and our partners are unable to protect our intellectual property, in particular our patent protection for our principal products and processes, and prevent its use by third parties, our ability to compete in the market will be harmed, and we may not realize our profit potential. We rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws to protect our proprietary technology and prevent others from duplicating our products. However, these means may afford only limited protection and may not:  prevent our competitors from duplicating our products;  prevent our competitors from gaining access to our proprietary information and technology, or  permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage. Because of the length of time and the expense associated with bringing new products to the marketplace, we and our partners hold and are in the process of applying for a number of patents in the United States and abroad to protect our products and important processes and also have obtained or have the right to obtain exclusive licenses to certain patents and applications filed by others. However, the mere issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability. The United States Federal Courts or equivalent national courts or patent offices elsewhere may invalidate our patents or find them unenforceable. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights effectively or to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If our intellectual property rights are not adequately protected, we may not be able to commercialize our technologies, products, or services, and our competitors could commercialize our technologies, which could result in a decrease in our sales and market share that would harm our business and operating results. Specifically, the patent position of biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. The legal standards governing the validity of biotechnology patents are in transition, and current defenses as to issued biotechnology patents may not be adequate in the future. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to:  whether any pending or future patent applications held by us will result in an issued patent, or that if patents are issued to us, that such patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or competitive technologies,  whether competitors will be able to design around our patents or develop and obtain patent protection for technologies, designs or methods that are more effective than those covered by our patents and patent applications, or  the extent to which our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which may lead to costly litigation, result in the payment of substantial damages or royalties, and/or prevent us from using technology that is essential to our products. 27 Table of Contents We have established an extensive portfolio of patents and applications, both United States and foreign, related to our BPI-related products, including novel compositions, their manufacture, formulation, assay and use. We have also established a portfolio of patents, both United States and foreign, related to our BCE technology, including claims to novel promoter sequences, secretion signal sequences, compositions and methods for expression and secretion of recombinant proteins from bacteria, including immunoglobulin gene products. If certain patents issued to others are upheld or if certain patent applications filed by others issue and are upheld, we may require licenses from others in order to develop and commercialize certain potential products incorporating our technology or we may become involved in litigation to determine the proprietary rights of others. These licenses, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, and any such litigation may be costly and may have other adverse effects on our business, such as inhibiting our ability to compete in the marketplace and absorbing significant management time. Due to the uncertainties regarding biotechnology patents, we also have relied and will continue to rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position. All of our employees have signed confidentiality agreements under which they have agreed not to use or disclose any of our proprietary information. Research and development contracts and relationships between us and our scientific consultants and potential customers provide access to aspects of our know-how that are protected generally under confidentiality agreements. These confidentiality agreements may be breached or may not be enforced by a court. To the extent proprietary information is divulged to competitors or to the public generally, such disclosure may adversely affect our ability to develop or commercialize our products by giving others a competitive advantage or by undermining our patent position. Litigation regarding intellectual property can be costly and expose us to risks of counterclaims against us. We may be required to engage in litigation or other proceedings to protect our intellectual property. The cost to us of this litigation, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Such litigation could also divert managements attention and resources. In addition, if this litigation is resolved against us, our patents may be declared invalid, and we could be held liable for significant damages. In addition, we may be subject to a claim that we are infringing another partys patent. If such claim is resolved against us, we or our collaborators may be enjoined from developing, manufacturing, selling or importing products, processes or services unless we obtain a license from the other party. Such license may not be available on reasonable terms, thus preventing us from using these products, processes or services and adversely affecting our revenue. Manufacturing risks and inefficiencies may adversely affect our ability to manufacture products for ourselves or others. We are subject to manufacturing risks which may hinder our ability to provide manufacturing services for our own benefit or to third parties. Additionally, unanticipated fluctuations in customer requirements may lead to manufacturing inefficiencies. We must provide our manufacturing services in compliance with regulatory requirements, in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis, while maintaining acceptable product quality and manufacturing costs. Additional resources and changes in our manufacturing processes may be required for each new product or customer or to meet increasing customer requirements once a contract has been initiated, and this work may not be successfully or efficiently completed. In addition, the development work and products addressed in new contracts may not share production attributes with our existing projects to the extent we anticipate, and consequently these new contracts may require the development of new manufacturing technologies and expertise. If we are unable to develop manufacturing capabilities as needed, on acceptable terms, our ability to complete these contracts or enter into additional contracts may be adversely affected. Manufacturing and quality problems may arise in the future as we continue to perform these services for our own benefit and under additional manufacturing contracts. Consequently, our internal development goals or 28 Table of Contents milestones under our contracts may not be achieved in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost, or at all. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve our manufacturing processes and to design, develop and purchase manufacturing equipment that may not yield the improvements that we expect. Inefficiencies or constraints related to our manufacturing may adversely affect our overall financial results. Such inefficiencies or constraints may also result in delays or loss of current or potential customers due to their dissatisfaction. The financial terms of future collaborative or licensing arrangements could result in dilution of our share value. Funding from collaboration partners and others has in the past and may in the future involve issuance by us of our shares. Because we do not currently have any such arrangements, we cannot be certain how the purchase price of such shares, the relevant market price or premium, if any, will be determined or when such determinations will be made. Any such issuance could result in dilution in the value of our issued and outstanding shares. Because many of the companies we do business with are also in the biotechnology sector, the volatility of that sector can affect us indirectly as well as directly. As a biotechnology company that collaborates with other biotech companies, the same factors that affect us directly can also adversely impact us indirectly by affecting the ability of our collaborators, partners and others we do business with to meet their obligations to us and reduce our ability to realize the value of the consideration provided to us by these other companies. For example, in connection with our licensing transactions relating to our BCE technology, we have in the past and may in the future agree to accept equity securities of the licensee in payment of license fees. The future value of these or any other shares we receive is subject both to market risks affecting our ability to realize the value of these shares and more generally to the business and other risks to which the issuer of these shares may be subject. As we do more business internationally, we will be subject to additional political, economic and regulatory uncertainties. We may not be able to successfully operate in any foreign market. We believe that, because the pharmaceutical industry is global in nature, international activities will be a significant part of our future business activities and that, when and if we are able to generate income, a substantial portion of that income will be derived from product sales and other activities outside the United States. Foreign regulatory agencies often establish standards different from those in the United States, and an inability to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis could put us at a competitive disadvantage or make it uneconomical to proceed with a products development. International operations and sales may be limited or disrupted by:  imposition of government controls,  export license requirements,  political or economic instability,  trade restrictions,  changes in tariffs,  restrictions on repatriating profits,  exchange rate fluctuations,  withholding and other taxation, and  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. 29 Table of Contents Because we are a relatively small biopharmaceutical company with limited resources, we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel, and the loss of key personnel could delay or prevent achieving our objectives. Our success in developing marketable products and achieving a competitive position will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and management personnel, particularly in areas requiring specific technical, scientific or medical expertise. There is intense competition for such personnel. Our research, product development and business efforts could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more key members of our scientific or management staff, particularly our executive officers: John L. Castello, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; J. David Boyle II, our Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; Patrick J. Scannon, M.D., Ph.D., our Executive Vice President and Chief Biotechnology Officer; and Christopher J. Margolin, our Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. We currently have no key person insurance on any of our employees. In February of 2007, Mr. Castello announced his plans to retire. Although he intends to continue to serve in his present capacities during the candidate search and transition period, our business could be adversely affected if the search and transition period take longer than expected or we are unable to find a suitable replacement. We had approximately 256 employees as of December 31, 2006, and we anticipate that we will require additional experienced executive, accounting, research and development, legal, administrative and other personnel in the future. There is intense competition for the services of these personnel, especially in California. Moreover, we expect that the high cost of living in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located, may impair our ability to attract and retain employees in the future. If we do not succeed in attracting new personnel and retaining and motivating existing personnel, our operations may suffer and we may be unable to implement our current initiatives or grow effectively. Calamities, power shortages or power interruptions at our Berkeley headquarters and manufacturing facility could disrupt our business and adversely affect our operations, and could disrupt the businesses of our customers. Our principal operations are located in Northern California, including our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility in Berkeley, California. In addition, many of our collaborators and licensees are located in California. All of these locations are in areas of seismic activity near active earthquake faults. Any earthquake, terrorist attack, fire, power shortage or other calamity affecting our facilities or our customers facilities may disrupt our business and could have material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are exposed to an increased risk of product liability claims. The testing, marketing and sales of medical products entails an inherent risk of allegations of product liability. In the event of one or more large, unforeseen awards of damages against us, our product liability insurance may not provide adequate coverage. A significant product liability claim for which we were not covered by insurance would have to be paid from cash or other assets. To the extent we have sufficient insurance coverage, such a claim would result in higher subsequent insurance rates. In addition, product liability claims can have various other ramifications including loss of future sales opportunities, increased costs associated with replacing products, and a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation, which could also adversely affect our business and operating results. We may be subject to increased risks because we are a Bermuda company. Alleged abuses by certain companies that have changed their legal domicile from jurisdictions within the United States to Bermuda have created an environment where, notwithstanding that we changed our legal domicile in a transaction that was approved by our shareholders and fully taxable to our company under United States law, we may be exposed to various prejudicial actions, including:  blacklisting of our common shares by certain pension funds, 30 Table of Contents  legislation restricting certain types of transactions, and  punitive tax legislation. We do not know whether any of these things will happen, but if implemented one or more of them may have an adverse impact on our future operations or our share price. If you were to obtain a judgment against us, it may be difficult to enforce against us because we are a foreign entity. We are a Bermuda company. All or a substantial portion of our assets, including substantially all of our intellectual property, may be located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for shareholders and others to enforce in United States courts judgments obtained against us. We have irrevocably agreed that we may be served with process with respect to actions based on offers and sales of securities made hereby in the United States by serving Christopher J. Margolin, c/o XOMA Ltd., 2910 Seventh Street, Berkeley, California 94710, our United States agent appointed for that purpose. Uncertainty exists as to whether Bermuda courts would enforce judgments of United States courts obtained in actions against us or our directors and officers that are predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States securities laws or entertain original actions brought in Bermuda against us or such persons predicated upon the United States securities laws. There is no treaty in effect between the United States and Bermuda providing for such enforcement, and there are grounds upon which Bermuda courts may not enforce judgments of United States courts. Certain remedies available under the United States federal securities laws may not be allowed in Bermuda courts as contrary to that nations policy. Our shareholder rights agreement or bye-laws may prevent transactions that could be beneficial to our shareholders and may insulate our management from removal. In February of 2003, we adopted a new shareholder rights agreement (to replace the shareholder rights agreement that had expired), which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire control of us in a transaction that our board of directors opposes. Our bye-laws:  require certain procedures to be followed and time periods to be met for any shareholder to propose matters to be considered at annual meetings of shareholders, including nominating directors for election at those meetings;  authorize our board of directors to issue up to 1,000,000 preference shares without shareholder approval and to set the rights, preferences and other designations, including voting rights, of those shares as the board of directors may determine; and  contain provisions, similar to those contained in the Delaware General Corporation Law that may make business combinations with interested shareholders more difficult. These provisions of our shareholders rights agreement and our bye-laws, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of common shares, could limit the ability of shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests, and could make it considerably more difficult for a potential acquirer to replace management. We may issue additional equity securities and thereby materially and adversely affect the price of our common shares. We are authorized to issue, without shareholder approval, 1,000,000 preference shares, of which 2,959 were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2006, which may give other shareholders dividend, conversion, 31 Table of Contents voting, and liquidation rights, among other rights, which may be superior to the rights of holders of our common shares. In addition, we are authorized to issue, without shareholder approval, up to 210,000,000 common shares, of which 105,454,389 were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2006. If we issue additional equity securities, the price of our common shares and, in turn, the price of our convertible notes may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, there were $44.5 million aggregate principal amount of New Notes outstanding, which were convertible into an aggregate of 23,750,873 common shares, with an aggregate of 1,889,317 additional shares issuable in lieu of the additional interest that would be due on such conversion. If the trading price of our common shares fails to comply with the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq National Market, we would face possible delisting, which would result in a limited public market for our common shares and make obtaining future debt or equity financing more difficult for us. If we do not continue to comply with the continued listing requirements for The Nasdaq National Market, then Nasdaq may provide written notification regarding the delisting of our securities. At that time, we would have the right to request a hearing to appeal The Nasdaq determination and would also have the option to apply to transfer our securities to The Nasdaq SmallCap Market. We cannot be sure that our price will comply with the requirements for continued listing of our common shares on The Nasdaq National Market, or that any appeal of a decision to delist our common shares will be successful. If our common shares lose their status on The Nasdaq National Market and we are not successful in obtaining a listing on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market, our common shares would likely trade in the over-the-counter market. If our common shares are neither listed for trading on a United States national or regional securities exchange nor approved for trading on The Nasdaq National Market, Nasdaq SmallCap Market or any other established United States system of automated dissemination or quotations of securities prices, it would be deemed a fundamental change under the indenture governing our convertible notes, giving the holders thereof the right to require us to repurchase such notes. Our failure to repurchase our convertible notes would constitute an event of default under the notes indenture, which might constitute an event of default under the terms of our other debt. If our shares were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our common shares could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event our common shares are delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common shares, further limiting the liquidity thereof. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for common shares. Such delisting from The Nasdaq National Market or future declines in our share price could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing, and could significantly increase the ownership dilution to shareholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions. Consent under the Exchange Control Act 1972 (and its related regulations) has been obtained from the Bermuda Monetary Authority for the issue and transfer of our shares, notes and other securities to and between non-residents of Bermuda for exchange control purposes, but this consent is conditional on our shares remaining listed on an appointed stock exchange. We cannot assure you that the Bermuda Monetary Authority will give the same or a similar consent in the event our common shares are no longer listed on The Nasdaq National Market or another appointed stock exchange. In the absence of such a general consent, specific consents of the Bermuda Monetary Authority would be required for certain issues and transfers of our shares, notes and other securities. Item 1B.
