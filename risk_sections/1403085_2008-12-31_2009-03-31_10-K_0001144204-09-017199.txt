Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the risk factors described in our registration statement on Form SB-2, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and although smaller reporting companies are not required to provide disclosure pursuant to this Item, your attention is directed to the following risk factor that relates to our business. We do not have sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses for the next twelve months, and plan to seek funding through the sale of our common stock. Without significant improvement in the capital markets, we may not be able to sell our common stock and funding may not be available for continued operations. There is not enough cash on hand to fund our administrative and other operating expenses or our proposed research and development program for the next twelve months. In addition, we will require substantial new capital following the development of a strategic marketing plan for bringing our product to global markets in order to actually market, arrange for the manufacturing of, and sell our product. Because we do not expect to have any cash flow from operations within the next twelve months, we will need to raise additional capital, which may be in the form of loans from current stockholders and/or from public and private equity offerings. Our ability to access capital will depend on our success in implementing our business plan. It will also depend upon the status of the capital markets at the time such capital is sought. Without significant improvement in the capital markets, sufficient capital may not be available and the implementation of our business plan could be delayed. If we are unable to raise additional funds in the future, we may have to cease all substantive operations. In such an event, it would not be likely that investors would obtain a profitable return on their investment or a return of their investment at all. 5 RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY Item 1B.
