Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Â— continued The Warrant we issued to the U.S. Treasury may be dilutive to holders of our common stock. The ownership interest of the existing holders of our common stock may be diluted to the extent the warrant we issued to the U.S. Treasury in connection with the sale to the U.S. Treasury of the Series A Preferred Stock is exercised. Although we redeemed all of the outstanding preferred stock previously issued to the U.S. Treasury, we did not repurchase the outstanding warrant and it will remain outstanding until 2019 or until we repurchase it. The shares of common stock underlying the warrant represent approximately 1.80 percent of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of January 31, 2012 (including the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant in total shares outstanding). Although the U.S. Treasury has agreed not to vote any of the shares of common stock it receives upon exercise of the warrant, a transferee of any portion of the warrant or of any shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of the warrant is not bound by this restriction. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited. Holders of our common stock will be entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our Board of Directors could reduce, suspend or eliminate our dividend at any time. Any decrease or elimination to the dividends on our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Mainline Bancorp, Inc. The success of the merger with Mainline will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of S&T and Mainline. However, to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings, we must successfully combine our business and the businesses of Mainline. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Item 1B.
