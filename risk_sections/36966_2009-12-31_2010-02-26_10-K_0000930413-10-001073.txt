ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS This Item outlines specific risks that could affect the ability of our various businesses to compete, change our risk profile, or materially impact our financial results and condition. Our operating environment continues to evolve and new risks continue to emerge. To address that challenge we have an enterprise-wide risk management committee that oversees processes for monitoring evolving risks and oversees various initiatives designed to manage and control our potential exposure. The following discussion highlights risks which could impact us in material ways by causing our future results to differ materially from our past results, by causing future results to differ materially from current expectations, or by causing material changes in our financial condition. In this Item we have outlined risks that we believe are important to us at the present time. However, other risks may prove to be important in the future, and new risks may emerge at any time. We cannot predict with certainty all potential developments which could affect our financial performance or condition. 18 Forward-Looking Statements This report, including materials incorporated into it, may contain forward-looking statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, goals, expectations, and estimates. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not a representation of historical information but rather are related to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. The words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, should, is likely, will, going forward, and other expressions that indicate future events and trends identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond any companys control, and many of which, with respect to future business decisions and actions (including acquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change. Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include, among other important factors: general and local economic and business conditions, including economic recession or depression; expectations of and actual timing and amount of interest rate movements, including the slope of the yield curve, which can have a significant impact on a financial services institution; market and monetary fluctuations; inflation or deflation; customer, investor, regulatory, and legislative responses to any or all of these conditions; the financial condition of borrowers and other counterparties; competition within and outside the financial services industry; geopolitical developments including possible terrorist activity; natural disasters; effectiveness and cost-efficiency of our hedging practices; technology; demand for our product offerings; new products and services in the industries in which we operate; and critical accounting estimates. Other factors are those inherent in lending and holding loan-based assets including prepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuation in U.S. housing and other real estate prices, fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in customer profiles. Additionally, the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and other regulators; actions of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which has purchased securities from us under its Capital Purchase Program; regulatory, administrative, and judicial proceedings and changes in laws and regulations applicable to us; and our success in executing our business plans and strategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing, could cause actual results to differ. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that are made in this report or in any other statement, release, report, or filing from time to time. Actual results could differ because of one or more factors, including those listed above or presented below, in other sections of this report, or in material incorporated by reference into this report. Readers of this report should carefully consider the factors discussed in this Item below, among others, in evaluating forward-looking statements and assessing our prospects. Competition Risks We compete with other financial services companies for customers. Our primary areas of competition include: retail and commercial deposits and bank loans, wealth management, personal or consumer loans including home mortgages and lines of credit, capital markets products and services, and other consumer and business financial products and services. Our competitors in these areas include national, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and other financial services companies that serve the markets which we serve. Some competitors are banks, subject to the same regulatory regime as we are, while others are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation. We expect that competition will continue to grow more intense with respect to most of our products and services. Heightened competition tends to put 19 downward pressure on revenues from affected items, upward pressure on marketing and other promotional costs, or both. For additional information regarding competition for customers, refer to the Competition heading of Part I, Item 1 beginning on page 15 of this report. While we face competition for customers, we also compete for financial capital (see Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks beginning on page 24 of this report) and to acquire and retain the human capital we need to thrive. Labor markets change over time. The segments of that market most useful to us may contract with demographic shifts relating to age, birth rates, education levels, geography, local or regional economic conditions, and other factors. Growth and Disposition Risks Every organization faces risks associated with growth. Our growth from 2003 to 2007 resulted primarily from a combination of: our expansion strategy in banking based on our mortgage operations; acquisition of customers from competitors that have merged with each other; and targeted non-bank business acquisitions. In 2007 and 2008 we modified our strategy in response to substantial and rapid changes in business conditions. As a result, in 2008 we sold our national mortgage platforms, closed our national specialty lending operations, and renewed our emphasis on financial services in our traditional Tennessee-based markets. Additional information concerning these matters is presented under Recent Recession and Disruptions beginning on page 32. Although our strategy is expected to evolve as business conditions continue to change, at present our strategys primary components are to invest capital and other resources in our current Tennessee-based retail/commercial banking market footprints, and in our capital markets business. In any case growth is expected to be coordinated with a focus on stronger and more stable returns on capital. Our growth in the past has been primarily organic rather than through substantial acquisitions; in the future, that pattern may shift if appropriate opportunities, within or outside of our current markets, present themselves. We believe that the successful execution of our strategy depends upon a number of key elements, including: ● our ability to attract and retain banking customers in our Tennessee-based regional banking market areas; ● in our capital markets business, our ability to maintain or strengthen our existing customer relationships while at the same time successfully identifying and exploiting opportunities for new products and services, and for new customers, in the US and overseas; ● our ability to develop and retain profitable customer relationships while expanding or enhancing our existing information processing, technology, and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently; ● our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with organic growth; and ● our ability to manage the operational, cultural, and (in some cases) liquidity and capital difficulties associated with growth through purchases. We have in place strategies designed to achieve those elements that are significant to us at present. Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them, or adopt new strategies, as conditions change. To the extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions, we face various risks associated with that practice, including: ● our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the contingent risks in the acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately; ● our ability to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and cost-effectively; 20 ● our ability to integrate the name recognition and goodwill of the acquired company with our own; and, ● our ability to retain customers and key employees of the acquired company. At times a company must consider disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses or units that no longer fit into managements plans for the future. Key risks associated with dispositions, including closures, include: ● our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate appropriate terms; ● our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained businesses; ● our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the disposed or exited business had with our retained businesses; and ● our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise in the event of a closure or other disposition that results in significant cash expenditures or a financial loss to us. Credit Risks We face the risk that our customers may not repay their loans and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a loss. In our business some level of credit loss is unavoidable and overall levels of credit loss can vary over time. Since 2007 credit losses increased to historically high levels, as mentioned in Recent Recession and Disruptions beginning on page 32. Our ability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and the value of collateral, including real estate. We manage credit risk by attempting to diversify our loan portfolio and by managing its granularity, and by recording and managing an allowance for expected loan losses based on the factors mentioned above and in accordance with applicable accounting rules. We also record loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules. These guidelines and rules could change and cause charge-offs to increase for reasons related or unrelated to the underlying performance of our portfolio. Moreover, the SEC could take accounting positions applicable to our holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken by the OCC or other regulators for the Bank. A significant challenge for us is to keep the credit and other models and approaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment, in real estate prices and other collateral values, and in the economy, among other things, based on our experience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. In recent years we have changed our models and approaches based on changes in circumstances, and we will do so again. At times those changes have had significant impacts upon our reported financial results and condition. In addition, we use those models and approaches to manage our loan portfolios and lending businesses. To the extent our models and approaches are not consistent with underlying real-world conditions, our management decisions could be adversely affected with substantial consequences to the Corporation. Additional information concerning credit risks and our management of them is set forth under the captions Credit Risk Management beginning on page 40, Foreclosure and Repurchase Reserves beginning on page 57, and Allowance for Loan Losses beginning on page 52, of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. 21 Insurance We use insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction of property, legal and other liability, and certain types of credit risks. Not all such risks are insured, in any given insured situation our insurance may be inadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For those risks that are insured, we also face the risks that the insurer may default on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat the former risk as a type of credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurers that we use and by striving to use more than one insurer when practical. The risk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith, is inherent in any contractual situation. A portion of our retail loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance. If a default insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent, that could adversely affect the carrying value of loans insured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in our loan loss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans on our balance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financial results. If many default insurers were to experience downgrades or insolvency at the same time, the risk of a financial impact would be amplified and the disruption to the default insurance industry could curtail our ability to originate new loans that need such insurance, which would result in a loss of business for us. Risk From Economic Downturns and Changes Delinquencies and credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to an increase in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressure on collateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level of creditworthiness), deposit and other products, and financial services may decline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affected by other national, regional, or local economic factors that impact demand for loans and other financial products and services. Such factors include, for example, changes in interest rates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning rates or prices. Accordingly, an economic downturn or other adverse economic change (local, regional, national, or global) can hurt our financial performance in the form of higher loan losses, lower loan production levels, lower deposit levels, and lower fees from transactions and services. Additional information illustrating these risks is given in Recent Recession and Disruptions beginning on page 32. Hedge Risks In the normal course of our businesses, including (among others) banking, mortgage, and capital markets, we attempt to create partial or full economic hedges of various, though not all, financial risks. Our hedging activities are discussed in more detail in various places under the following captions of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report: Risk Management, beginning on page 31; and, Critical Accounting Policies, beginning on page 52. Hedging creates certain risks for us, including the risk that the other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type of credit risk), and the risk that the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk). Unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings. Service Risks We engage in a wide range of activities in which we provide services to customers. These activities create risk of claims against us that the services were provided in a manner that harmed the customer or a third party, or were contrary to applicable laws or rules. These activities include fiduciary, custodial, funds management, and advisory services, among others. We manage these risks primarily through training programs and supervision processes. Reputation Risks Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtain and retain customers, is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and our financial stability. Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Our reputation is affected principally by our own practices and how those 22 practices are perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, also may adversely impact our reputation. In addition, adverse perceptions relating to parties with whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation. Senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring, assessment, and management. Damage to our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets or otherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones, could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and could undermine our ability to attract and retain talented employees, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may also result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that change or constrain our business or operations. Events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk. Operational Risks Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependent in part upon our ability to create and maintain an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure, manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with the ability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arise in many ways, including: errors related to failed or inadequate physical, operational, information technology, or other processes; faulty or disabled computer or other technology systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data and related security breaches, or other criminal conduct by employees or third parties; and exposure to other external events. Inadequacies may present themselves in a myriad of ways, and actions taken to manage one risk may be ineffective for others. For example, information technologies systems may be insufficiently redundant to withstand a fire, incursion, or other major casualty, and they may be insufficiently adaptable to new business conditions or opportunities. Efforts to make such systems more robust may also make them less adaptable, and vice-versa. In addition, we outsource some of our operational functions to third parties. Those third parties may experience similar errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in some cases, limited ability to quickly obtain an alternate vendor. To the extent we increase our reliance on third party vendors to perform or assist operational functions, the challenge of managing the associated risks becomes more difficult. For example, in 2008 we sold our national mortgage origination and servicing platforms. We retained significant servicing right assets, however, and we continue to originate mortgage products in our regional banking markets in and around Tennessee. Of practical necessity, we have outsourced our servicing functions to the purchaser of our platforms, and we have outsourced many key roles in the Tennessee-based mortgage origination process to a third party. Managing the operational, compliance, reputational, liability, and other risks associated with this level of outsourcing in those business areas is an ongoing challenge for us. Failure to build and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure, or failure of our disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructure components suffer damage, can lead to risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions, and noncompliance with applicable laws or regulatory standards. Operational risk is specifically managed through internal monitoring, measurement, and assessment by line management and oversight of processes by top management, and by maintaining systems to adhere to regulatory guidance. Additional information concerning operational risks and our management of them appears under the caption Operational Risk Management beginning on page 40 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. 23 Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks Management of liquidity and related risks is a key function for our business. Additional information concerning liquidity risk management is set forth under the caption Liquidity Management beginning on page 34 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. In general, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing business and, therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results. Our funding requirements currently are met principally by deposits and by financing from other financial institutions, particularly (in 2008 and 2009) government institutional lending to us under the Term Auction Facility (TAF) program as well as Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) secured lending. Historically we also depended upon financing from private institutional investors by means of the capital markets; however, in 2008 and 2009 we were not able to utilize the private markets economically, and we are not able to predict when we will again be able to utilize them economically. Deposits, the TAF program, and FHLB lending, among other things, have provided funds to us more affordably; however, the future costs and availability of those funding sources largely are not within our control. The TAF program is scheduled to be discontinued in 2010, and by year-end 2009 we had reduced our TAF utilization significantly. Late in 2008 FDIC deposit insurance coverage was expanded significantly, but on a temporary basis. Coverage on most accounts increased to $250,000; that increase is scheduled to expire after 2013. Coverage on certain non-interest bearing accounts became unlimited; that increase is scheduled to expire in 2010. We believe that those increased coverage levels resulted in some amount of increased deposit levels; that result could be reversed if the coverage increases expire. A number of more general factors could make such funding more difficult, more expensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financial results, organizational or political changes, adverse impacts on our reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our loan portfolio or other assets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economic conditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environments governing our funding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies and financial markets as well as the policies and capabilities of the U.S. government and its agencies, and may become or remain increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors beyond our control. Events affecting interest rates, markets, and other factors which adversely impact our ability or desire to access the capital markets for funding likewise may adversely affect the demand for our services in our capital markets business. As a result, disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings in that business unit as well as in our regional banking unit. For instance, disruptions in 2007 that were related to mortgages and mortgage-backed assets significantly reduced the demand for certain of our capital markets products and services and increased the costs and uncertainties associated with our mortgage servicing portfolio. Rating agencies assign credit ratings to issuers and their debt. In that role, agencies directly affect the availability and cost of our funding. The Corporation and the Bank currently receive ratings from several rating entities for unsecured borrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating of Baa3 or higher by Moodys Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for many purposes. At the present time, all three rating agencies rate the unsecured senior debt of the Corporation and the Bank as investment grade, although we are at or near the lowest levels of that grade. To the extent that in the future we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital, we could experience reduced liquidity and increased cost of funding if our debt ratings were lowered further, particularly if lowered below investment grade. In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about our ratings in the future and thus can adversely affect the cost and availability of funding, including placing us on negative outlook or on watchlist. Please note that 24 a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In addition to the direct liquidity risks noted above, reductions our in credit ratings could allow counterparties to terminate and immediately force us to settle certain derivatives agreements, and could force us to provide additional collateral with respect to certain derivatives agreements. Additional information concerning those matters is provided under the caption Derivative Instruments within Note 25 to our financial statements, beginning on page 148 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 15 of Part IV of this report. Certain regulatory laws or rules establish minimum capital levels or define risk-weighting for capital, regulate deposit insurance, and govern related funding matters for banks. Those laws or rules could be changed in a manner that could increase our overall cost of capital and thus reduce our earnings. Before we disposed of our national lending operations, we depended on our ability to sell or securitize first- and second-lien mortgage loans and, prior to 2007, home equity line of credit loans (which we refer to as HELOC), and we depended upon our ability to sell mortgages and/or mortgage servicing rights. Those actions involved the sale of whole loans (sometimes on a servicing-retained basis) or of beneficial interests in loans. Going forward, our mortgage origination activity continues within our Tennessee-based regional banking footprint. Most mortgages originated are processed, sold, and serviced on a private-label basis through a third party under contract with us. However, risks pertaining to our new loan originations, our retained loans and servicing rights assets, and our former funding activities, continue. When we sold or securitized mortgage and HELOC loans, we sometimes did so with varying degrees of recourse, which meant, in effect, that we retained some of the risk for the loan if it defaulted. Generally we sold or securitized loans with no recourse. A loan sold with recourse means the seller retains substantial or full responsibility if it defaults. For a loan we sold without recourse, we could still bear responsibility to the buyer in many cases if the loan defaulted early or was paid off early (typically within the first 90 days), or if the loan did not conform to representations we made to the buyer at the time of sale. At present, in those cases where we are responsible for a loan for representation non-conformity, usually we satisfy our obligations to the buyer by repurchase or by making the buyer whole economically. Typically we had similar obligations for breach of representation, non-conformity, or early default, if the loan was included on a non-recourse basis in a securitization transaction or loan sale, if the transaction was a sale of servicing rights, or if we had a make-whole or other indemnity obligation. Repurchase and make-whole loans (for representation non-conformity) frequently involve default or fraud and therefore frequently result in losses to us. We managed the risk of non-conformity through origination and documentation controls and procedures, and through post-closing quality control processes and repurchase and make-whole request reviews. In recent years we have experienced an increase in loan repurchases and make-wholes for these reasons; 2009 saw a sharp increase. Management has augmented its review process and maintains a reserve for losses related to loan repurchases and make-wholes due to both nonconformity and recourse obligations. Additional information concerning these risks is set forth under the caption Foreclosure and Repurchase Reserves beginning on page 57 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks A significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money. Accordingly, changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues and expenses, and potentially could expand or 25 compress our net interest margin. We actively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates. Additional information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under the caption Interest Rate Risk Management beginning on page 32 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Our mortgage servicing rights (MSR) portfolio is affected by changes in interest rates. Although we sold our mortgage servicing platform in 2008, at present we still retain substantial MSR assets. The value of MSR assets declines when the underlying loans are refinanced or otherwise paid early. Generally, when interest rates increase, the value of MSR generally increases, and when rates decline the value of MSR tends to decline. However, those general tendencies do not result in concrete outcomes in all circumstances; for example, a decrease in interest rates does not always result in a predictable increase in refinancings because other factors may blunt loan demand or curtail credit availability. Additional information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under the caption Mortgage Servicing Rights and Other Related Retained Interests beginning on page 54 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. We face the risks associated with movements in the yield curve. The yield curve simply shows the interest rates applicable to short and long term debt. The curve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; it is flat when short-term rates are equal, or nearly equal, to long-term rates; and it is inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, the yield curve normally is positively sloped. However, the yield curve can be relatively flat or inverted for short or even protracted periods. A flat or inverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, which would adversely impact our lending businesses, and it tends to reduce demand for long-term debt securities, which would adversely impact the revenues of our capital markets business. A prolonged inversion of the yield curve historically is so uncommon that it is difficult to predict all the effects that such a market condition is reasonably likely to create. Expectations by the market regarding the direction of future interest rate movements, particularly long-term rates, can impact the demand for long-term debt which in turn can impact the revenues of our capital markets business. That risk is most apparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected in market rates, or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain. Securities Inventories and Market Risks Our capital markets business buys and sells various types of securities for its institutional customers. In the course of that business we hold inventory positions and are exposed to certain risks of market fluctuations. In addition, we are exposed to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with debt securities. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities through certain policies and procedures, including hedging activities related to certain interest rate risks. Additional information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under the caption Market Risk Management beginning on page 40 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report, and in the Credit Risks discussion beginning on page 21 of this report. 26 In addition, we earn fees and other income related to our brokerage business and our management of assets for customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adversely affect those revenue sources. We have exposure to risks related to securities markets in other respects as well. We have a number of assets and obligations that are linked, directly or indirectly, to major securities markets. Significant changes in market performance can have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. A major example of that linkage is our obligation to fund our pension plan so that it may satisfy benefit claims in the future. Our pension funding obligations generally depend upon actuarial estimates of benefits claims and actuarial estimates of future plan asset values. To a substantial extent the pension plan invests its assets in marketable securities. Our obligations to fund the plan can diminish substantially if the plans investments perform well, and can grow substantially if those investments perform poorly. Changes in those obligations generally translate into positive or negative changes in our pension expense, which in turn affects our financial performance. Although our obligations and expenses relative to the plan can be affected by many other things, including changes in our participating employee population and changes to the plan itself, declines in market performance in recent years will tend to increase our obligations to fund the pension plan over the next several years. We recently modified the plan design and will implement a freeze of new benefits after 2012, and we changed the asset allocation investment strategy; we expect these changes to moderate future volatility in this area. Venture Capital Risks Venture capital investments are inherently volatile. The companies in which we have invested are much less mature, smaller, and much more unproven than a typical public company. Accordingly, those investments carry a substantial risk of loss. Venture capital investments also are inherently illiquid. Success in this business can only be assessed in the long term and depends to a very large extent upon the ability of management to find sound investment prospects, negotiate financially appropriate investment terms, and oversee each investment as the company uses the venture capital and develops. In the short term, venture capital losses are not uncommon even if the business proves to be successful in the long term. Starting in 2008 we began winding down this business; however, due to the illiquid nature of these investments, the wind-down process will occur over an extended period. Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks We operate in a heavily regulated industry. The regulatory environment has been changing more rapidly in recent years, and the regulatory burdens generally have been increasing, as a result of recent events affecting traditional banking, mortgage banking, and financial markets generally. We are subject to many banking, deposit, insurance, insurance brokerage, securities brokerage and underwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rules applicable to all companies publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets and, in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in financial, structural, and operational penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this report, beginning on page 5 above, for additional information concerning financial industry regulations. Federal and state regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we, as a financial institution, may engage. In addition, we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct our business, such as in the areas of employment and intellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities increasingly consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones. Such actions could further limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, could further restrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, or could materially affect us in other ways. Additional federal and state consumer protection regulations also could expand the privacy protections afforded to customers of 27 financial institutions, restricting our ability to share or receive customer information and increasing our costs. The following paragraphs highlight certain specific important risk areas related to legal matters currently. These paragraphs do not describe these risks exhaustively, and they do not describe all legal risks that we face currently. Moreover, the importance of specific risks will grow or diminish as circumstances change. Regulatory and Other Pressures Related to Operating Losses The Bank is required to maintain certain regulatory capital levels and ratios, as discussed under the caption Capital Adequacy beginning on page 7 of this report. If the Banks financial losses continue, or if the regulatory requirements were to increase, then at some point the Banks ability to meet those requirements could be adversely affected. Pressure to maintain appropriate capital levels and address business needs in a recessionary environment during times of financial loss may lead to actions that could be adverse to our shareholders, at least in the short term. Such actions that have already occurred include the elimination of our common cash dividend, the sale of our common stock and the issuance of a common stock warrant at times (in 2008) when market prices were disadvantageous, and a contraction of our balance sheet (involving sales or other dispositions of assets or businesses) at times when market values were depressed. Further such actions could occur. Federal and State Regulatory Jurisdiction Some state authorities from time to time have challenged, and on occasion continue to challenge, the position of the OCC that it is the exclusive regulator of various aspects of national banks or their operating subsidiaries. If one or more of those challenges were successful, or if Congress or the OCC were to change the applicable banking laws or regulations, we could be impacted significantly, due, among other things, to possible increased regulatory burdens, governmental (including state attorney general) and private party actions alleging non-compliance with state law, and the expense of tracking and complying with the different laws and regulations of those states in which we do business. In its 2009 decision known as Cuomo v. Clearing House Association L.L.C., the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the OCC does not have the exclusive ability to enforce certain state and local laws applicable to certain business activities of national banks which are not pre-empted by federal law. The Cuomo decision modified the position of the OCC and lower court decisions that had affirmed the OCCs regulations regarding its visitorial power, and limited the application of a 2007 Supreme Court decision known as Watters v. Wachovia Bank N.A. which had been viewed as indirectly supportive of the OCCs position. It is not possible at this time to gauge what effects the Cuomo decision will have upon us. Although our regional banking business operates primarily in the state of Tennessee, we have branches in other states, we have customers in several more, and a component of our long-term strategy is possible further expansion into other southeastern states. In addition, our capital markets business has customers and offices in many states, and our mortgage banking and national specialty lending businesses hold and service (directly or indirectly) assets originated across the U.S. Cuomo holds that the National Bank Act allows states to enforce non-pre-empted laws through judicial proceedings against national banks. Most states and some communities have in place various laws pertaining to lending and other business activities conducted by banks, some of which may not be pre- 28 empted by federal law. Dealing with potential state and local enforcement activity relating to non-pre-empted laws would, at a minimum, increase the compliance costs for national banks that have multi-state operations. Recent Legislation In 2008 the U.S. Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, sometimes known as EESA. Under authority of EESA the U.S. Department of the Treasury initiated a Capital Purchase Program, sometimes referred to as the CPP, which has been implemented in conjunction with the U.S. banking regulators under an umbrella called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. Under the CPP, the Treasury has purchased preferred stock from approved financial institutions upon terms and conditions set by the Treasury, and in late 2008 the Treasury purchased preferred stock from us. In February 2009, the U.S. Congress enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act), which amended portions of EESA relevant to CPP participants. Additional information concerning our participation in the TARP appears in EESA Legislation and TARP Participation beginning on page 10 of this report. Among other things, the Recovery Act significantly restricts incentive compensation, including bonus and retention awards, for the executives whose compensation is described in detail in our proxy statement (the named executives) and for the twenty employees, excluding the named executives, whose total compensation is the highest (the Highest 20). Extensive new rules were adopted by the Treasury in 2009 to implement these new restrictions. The new TARP restrictions on incentives would cease to apply once all of the CPP preferred stock that we sold to the Treasury is redeemed. The TARP rules have created several new risks for us and for other institutions that sold preferred stock to the Treasury, including the following: ● Pay Substantially Less Linked to Performance. The TARP restrictions on incentive compensation may adversely affect our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our highest performing employees, and therefore may adversely affect our business. Historically, we have embraced a pay-for-performance philosophy for employees at many levels of the company. Starting in 2010 the restriction on incentives will significantly de-link pay from performance for our named executives. For those de-linked persons, salary will be a larger component of their compensation package. We have responded by paying supplemental salary in the form of salary stock units, which ties the value of the salary increases to the value of our stock. However, the linkage of SSUs to performance is much weaker than is true for our traditional cash bonus programs. It is uncertain how a salary-dominated pay structure for those persons might affect our overall performance during the period in which the TARP restrictions apply to us. ● Risks if We Desire to Redeem the CPP Preferred. Our redemption of the CPP preferred shares would reduce our regulatory capital and reduce cash on hand. We cannot redeem stock unless our Board and our regulators conclude it is consistent with safety, soundness, and other corporate and regulatory considerations. Those considerations could constrain our ability to redeem the preferred shares, especially in the short term, unless we create or raise an amount of replacement capital determined by our regulators to be acceptable. Creating new capital typically relies upon retaining earnings. Raising new capital could be dilutive to existing shareholders, and it may not be feasible if, at the time we wish to go to market, the market is disrupted or perceives us unfavorably. ● Interest Rates and Other Economic Changes. The Recovery Act and other legislation in 2009 are expected to result in a substantial increase in government expenditures and government debt for many years to come. It is not clear how those events will affect interest rates or the inflation rate, among other things, but both could rise as a result with adverse effects on the economy. In particular, as mentioned above, our businesses are very sensitive to changes in 29 interest rates and sudden changes in rates often have had an adverse effect on financial services companies. Recent Regulatory and Legislative Proposals At any given time the U.S. Congress, federal regulators, and the states in which we do business have pending a host of bills and other proposals that, if enacted or adopted, could substantially impact our businesses, operations, and financial results. Due to political and other processes, it is impossible to predict which proposals will become final and what provisions a final law or rule may have. The following paragraphs highlight, as examples, two recent proposals which could have a substantial impact upon us. ● The U.S. Congress is considering significant new regulatory reform legislation. The legislation has taken a number of different forms, some of which would significantly alter the regulatory framework applicable to us. Final legislation could incorporate elements from several older bills and could include wholly new provisions. For example, one recent version of regulatory reform legislation would create, among other things, a Consumer Finance Protection Agency (CFPA). If enacted, the CFPA would have substantial authority over our consumer finance products and services. The CFPAs rules could conflict with, and possibly override, our Banks primary regulator in consumer matters. The CFPAs rule-making authority could be extensive, including such things as setting terms and conditions on consumer products services and regulating compensation of our employees who deal with consumer matters. Such rules could substantially reduce revenues, increase costs and risks, and otherwise make our consumer businesses less profitable or unprofitable. In addition, it has been proposed that national banks, including our bank, be made subject to regulation by all the states in a number of respects. At a minimum this partial rescission of federal pre-emption would significantly increase compliance and operating costs, as well as the risk of unintentional non-compliance. ● The U.S. Congress and other governmental bodies recently have considered, and in the future may enact or adopt, new laws and regulations intended to modify the terms of outstanding consumer loans in a manner benefiting borrowers at the expense of lenders, restrict the ability of lenders to make new loans, and increase the regulatory burdens and legal risks on lenders and loan servicers. Some initiatives in this area have become final but further, and more invasive, measures could be adopted. We have a substantial amount of assets in the form of consumer loans and servicing rights originated in our now-discontinued national businesses; new rules that compel adverse changes in loan terms could have a substantial adverse impact on those portfolios. Litigation Risks We face litigation risks from customers, employees, vendors, contractual parties, and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federal or state regulators. We manage those risks through internal controls, personnel training, insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethics processes, and other means. However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with certainty. Since 2008 the risks of certain types of litigation have increased. For us, the most notable of those types are (i) lender liability claims, (ii) claims involving other types of distressed counterparties, (iii) claims based on declines in our stock price, and (iv) a new type of lender tort claim. The risk from the first two types has increased primarily because borrowers and other contractual counterparties have experienced financial stress, in many cases resulting in an attempt to obtain funds or relief from a solvent party (us). We expect that this heightened risk level will not abate until after economic conditions 30 substantially improve. The elevated risk associated with type (iii) largely is a result of our volatile stock price performance in 2007 and 2008, and eventually should fall back to ordinary levels if our stock price continues to stabilize. Regarding type (iv), some local governments or agencies have claimed that certain lenders in their communities have created a public nuisance, engaged in predatory or discriminatory lending, or otherwise are liable for the alleged consequences of inappropriate consumer lending, especially home mortgage lending. Lender tort claims of this sort, where alleged damages are measured on a statistical and/or city-wide basis, create litigation costs immediately and create a risk of significant litigation losses for those lenders which are named as defendants in them. Moreover, claims of this sort adversely alter the business climate and raise the costs and risks for all lenders, both in the communities involved and in similar communities across the country. Holding Company Dividends Historically the Corporation has depended upon common dividends from the Bank for cash to fund common dividends paid to the Corporations shareholders. However, in part because of the losses experienced by the Bank since 2007, regulatory constraints generally will prevent the Bank from declaring and paying dividends to the Corporation in 2010 without regulatory approval. Additional information concerning those regulatory restrictions on the Bank is discussed in more detail under the heading Liquidity Management in the Managements Discussion and Analysis section beginning on page 34 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which section is incorporated herein by reference. In 2008 the Corporation discontinued paying a quarterly cash dividend to its common stockholders and began distributing a dividend payable in shares of common stock. As a TARP participant, we will not be able to reinstate a common cash dividend unless we obtain regulatory consent, among other things. Additional information concerning our participation in the TARP appears in EESA Legislation and TARP Participation beginning on page 10 of this report. Accounting Risks Uncertainties in Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Three of our most critical estimates are: the level of the allowance for credit losses; the level of repurchase, make-whole, and foreclosure reserves; and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights. However, other estimates occasionally become highly significant, especially in volatile situations such as litigation and other loss contingency matters. Estimates are made at specific points in time; as actual events unfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future, we may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of our mortgage servicing rights, goodwill, or other assets, or we may recognize a significant decline in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights, or we may make some other adjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that we make today. For additional information concerning the sensitivity of these estimates, refer to Critical Accounting Policies beginning on page 52 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders. Changes to Rules and Practices In addition, accounting rules and practices change over time. Changes in accounting rules can significantly affect how we record and report assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. 31 Although such changes generally affect all companies in a given industry, in practice changes sometimes have a disparate impact due to differences in the circumstances or business operations of companies within the same industry. Risks of Expense Control Expenses and other costs directly affect our earnings. Our ability to successfully manage expenses is important to our long-term survival. Many factors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As our businesses change, either by expansion or contraction, additional expenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolving business strategies, and changing regulations, among other things. We manage expense growth and risk through a variety of means, including selectively outsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes. Geographic Risks Our capital markets business is national in scope, and our capital markets division is developing a business presence in selected Asian markets. Also, we continue to hold substantial assets originated under our now-discontinued national lending businesses. However, our traditional banking business remains grounded in, and depends upon, the major Tennessee markets. As a result, although some of our business operations and assets are exposed to geographically broad risks, to a significant degree our banking business is exposed to economic, regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks that primarily impact Tennessee and neighboring states where we do our traditional banking business. In other words, if the Tennessee region experiences adversity not shared by other parts of the country, we are likely to experience adversity to a degree not shared by those competitors which have a broader footprint. Non-U.S. Operations Risks We have two capital markets offices outside of the United States, in Hong Kong and Tokyo. Opening and operating non-U.S. offices creates a number of risks. Specific risks associated with any non-U.S. presence include: the risk that taxes, licenses, fees, prohibitions, and other barriers and constraints may be created or increased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact our ability to operate overseas profitably or at all; the risk that our assets and operations in a particular country could be nationalized in whole or part without adequate compensation; the risk that currency exchange rates could move unfavorably so as to diminish or destroy the U.S. dollar value of assets, or to enlarge the U.S. dollar value of liabilities, denominated in those currencies; the risk that legal recourse against foreign counterparties may be limited in unexpected ways; risks and costs associated with U.S. banking and other regulation of non-U.S. business activities; and the risk that political or cultural preferences in a particular host country might become antagonistic to U.S. companies. Our ability to manage those and other risks will depend upon a number of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipate differences in cultural and other expectations applicable to customers, employees, regulators, and vendors and other business partners; our ability to recognize and act upon opportunities and constraints peculiar to the countries and cultures in which our offices operate; our ability to recognize and manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed; and our ability to anticipate the stability of or changes in the political, legal, and monetary systems of the countries in which our offices operate. Recent Recession and Disruptions Starting in 2007 the U.S. economy in general, and the business environment for financial services companies in particular, experienced a significant recession. The recession continued throughout 2009, although by years end there were some signs that the worst aspects might have begun to ease and in some technical respects the recession may have ended in 2009. Some geographic areas and business sectors, and some companies and banks, were hurt more than others, or experienced the downturn at 32 different rates or different times. At this time it is not known, and not possible to predict, the ultimate effects of the recession. Although the recession did not create new types of risks, we believe it is useful to highlight in this section some of the key impacts of those events on our business to illustrate how events beyond our control can adversely affect us. Key Events of the Recession Examples of some of the most significant events related to the recession include the following:  Residential housing values in the U.S. fell in nearly every market, and in some highly-populated markets values fell significantly.  The volume of residential housing transactions also stagnated or fell, and in some markets volume fell significantly.  Except for conforming loans, which are loan products conforming to standards of certain government sponsored entities (GSEs), rates for some types of home mortgage products rose sharply and some mortgage products, with new and more restrictive credit criteria, became difficult for borrowers to obtain even at high interest rates, making it difficult or impossible for some borrowers to refinance an existing mortgage.  In 2007 private investor demand for new-issue mortgage-backed securities fluctuated suddenly and sharply, and for some categories of mortgages it disappeared almost entirely. Although this disruption has since moderated somewhat, private-sector demand for new-issue non-conforming mortgage-backed securities has not returned to prior levels.  Many companies in the U.S. in many sectors of the economy reported financial losses or significant reductions in earnings. Banks and other companies in the financial services industry were, in general, especially hard hit. A number of banks failed or were acquired under circumstances of substantial financial stress. Bank failures and acquisitions-under-duress could continue at elevated levels in 2010.  In 2008 the GSEs failed financially and were, in effect, taken over by the federal government. GSEs are the principal outlets for home mortgages in the U.S. Substantial new legislation was enacted during 2008 which changed how the GSEs operate and are regulated. The function of the GSEs as buyers of so-called conforming mortgages has continued under the new laws. In a related move, U.S. monetary policy has kept interest rates, especially home-mortgage rates, at historically low levels. The current functioning of the GSEs and monetary policy are credited with contributing to recent stabilization of real estate values in many parts of the U.S. However, if the GSEs activities and that monetary policy are not maintained in the future, real estate values could destabilize once again.  Unemployment rose as some companies failed and others reduced their staff. Early in 2010 unemployment in the U.S. continues to be elevated on average and in many regions.  Because of these factors, among others, loan defaults, foreclosures, and bankruptcies rose significantly for U.S. individuals and businesses.  Due to a significant rise in bank failures, the deposit insurance fund administered by the FDIC became depleted. To help maintain the fund, in 2009 the FDIC imposed a special insurance premium and required banks to prepay 3 years of insurance premiums.  In 2008 and 2009 substantial new laws were proposed and, in some cases, enacted, in response to the recession. Some of those applicable to us are mentioned in Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks beginning on page 27 of this report. 33 Key Impacts of the Recession upon the Corporation and the Bank Exit from National Mortgage and Specialty Lending Businesses Many of the significant disruptions in 2007 and 2008 impacted our mortgage businesses substantially. We decided to exit those businesses except in our traditional Tennessee-based banking region. In August 2008 we sold our mortgage origination and servicing platforms, and during that year we exited the national specialty lending businesses associated with the mortgage business. These actions had, and will continue to have, a substantial impact upon our financial results and our balance sheet. Substantial Increase in Losses Related to Lending and Assets from Exited Businesses Although we sold or closed our national mortgage and national specialty lending businesses, we retain as assets many of the loans that those businesses created. Most of those loans are secured by residential or other real estate situated across the U.S. We also retain a substantial portion of the mortgage servicing rights that we previously serviced, we continue to maintain hedge positions that we obtain to manage certain risks related to those retained servicing rights, and we retain the risk of liability to parties with whom we made contracts in the course of operating those businesses. These legacy assets and positions continue to impose risks on us. Key risks include:  The loans on our books have experienced significantly higher default and loss rates compared to pre-recession years. For example, due to declining home values, home loans secured on a second-lien basis in a significant number of cases have little or no collateral value to cover the loan if it defaults. Accordingly, a default on such a loan today will result in a much higher loss severity than would have resulted previously.  The incidence of parties claiming that loans that we sold to them did not meet contractual standards has risen. That trend may persist as parties seek to mitigate losses they experienced while holding those loans by any means possible.  The incidence of counterparty loss on hedges, swaps, and other such instruments may rise as those counterparties experience financial stress or failure. Other trends adverse to us may emerge from these legacy assets and positions as counterparties are stressed by economic conditions, and of course some of these impacts apply to continuing businesses. Over time those losses and risks related to legacy items should diminish since those exited businesses will not generate new loans and new contracts, but it is not possible to predict when that may occur. Our other lending businesses remain in place, and we are constantly seeking ways to prudently expand them. We have experienced a significant increase in default and loss rates in most of those products as well, and demand for new loans diminished as business activity in general became more subdued. We adjusted our underwriting, credit review, and loss mitigation processes and we will continue to seek ways to manage risk and minimize loss. However, we remain in the business of lending and that business carries more risk at present than it has in recent years past. That higher level of risk could increase further, and in any case that risk is likely to continue at an elevated level at least until the economy improves significantly in our lending markets. We regularly review and adjust the allowance for loan losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends, collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets as well as changes in housing price appreciation and depreciation. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. That process was made 34 significantly more difficult during the recession as rapid changes in business and economic conditions required us to adjust and re-adjust our methods. Decrease in Business Activities The slowdown reduced business activity, including activity which we finance by making loans and activity from which we earn fee revenues. Some activities fell substantially or ended completely, notably (for us) certain capital markets structured finance activities and certain fee-generating deposit account activities. All of these impacts reduce our revenues and our opportunities for new business. Net Interest Margin Compression Relatively low interest rates in the U.S. could stimulate new demand for consumer and business loans and business activity in general. Low rates could cause the recession to end more quickly and more vigorously than otherwise would be the case. However, in recent quarters falling rates compressed our net interest margin, which negatively affected our financial results, and could do so again. Deposit Run-off Risks As mentioned under Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks beginning on page 24 above, we rely significantly upon deposits for liquidity and to fund our business operations. Generally, deposits are a relatively stable and cost-effective source of funding for banks due to many factors, including FDIC deposit insurance. Changes in deposit levels can be influenced substantially by many factors, including customer satisfaction and the interest rates offered to deposit customers. Those rates, in turn, generally reflect prevailing market conditions. During 2008, the media occasionally highlighted the risk of an extreme form of deposit run-off, sometimes referred to as a run on the bank. More moderate levels of run-off can adversely affect banks but are substantially less dramatic and have been significantly less reported. The increased level of public concern created by the recession, punctuated by media reports of potential or actual bank failures, increased the risk of some level of deposit run-off for all depositary institutions. We experienced a degree of run-off in the summer and autumn of 2008 which was not dramatic but could have started a negative trend. Late in 2008 FDIC insurance coverage levels were increased on a temporary basis; run-off activity abated somewhat, and in fact our deposits grew during most of 2009. However, the run-off risk is likely to continue to be elevated until it is clear to the public that a significant economic recovery is underway. Moreover, some degree of deposit run off could occur if FDIC coverage amounts revert to pre-2008 levels. To manage run-off risk we maintain cash reserves and access to other liquidity sources to accommodate normal and, to a degree, unusual withdrawal activity, and we strive to respond promptly and accurately to customer concerns that might arise.
