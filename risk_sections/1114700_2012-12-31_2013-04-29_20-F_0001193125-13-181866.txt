Risk Factors, and with consideration that the Argentine economy has been historically volatile, which has negatively affected the volume and growth of the financial system. Item 5.B. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity - Holding Company on an Individual Basis We generate our net earnings/losses from our operating subsidiaries, specifically Banco Galicia, our main operating subsidiary. Although, from 2002 to 2010 we did not receive any dividends from Banco Galicia, it is the primary source of funds available to us. On April 27, 2011, Banco Galicias shareholders held a shareholders meeting during which they approved the distribution of cash dividends for a total amount of Ps.100.1 million. During May 2011, according to our participation of 94.84%, we received a cash dividend of Ps.94.9 million. Additionally, during 2011, we received from other subsidiaries cash dividends for Ps.38.9 million. During fiscal year 2012, Grupo Financiero Galicias subsidiaries approved a cash dividend distribution of Ps.61.4 million. Grupo Financiero Galicia received Ps.41.0 million of such amount during 2012 and the remaining amount of Ps.20.4 million will be received in May 2013. Banco Galicias dividend-paying ability had been affected since late 2001 by the effects of the 2001-2002 liquidity crisis and its impact on its income-generation capacity. In addition, there were other restrictions on Banco Galicias ability to pay dividends resulting from applicable Argentine Central Bank rules and the loan agreements entered into by Banco Galicia as part of its foreign debt restructuring. See Item 8. Financial Information-Dividend Policy and Dividends. The extent to which a banking subsidiary may extend credit or otherwise provide funds to a holding company is limited by Argentine Central Bank rules. For a description of these rules, see Item 4. Information on the Company-Argentine Banking Regulation-Lending Limits. According to Grupo Financiero Galicias policy for the distribution of dividends and due to the fact that most of the profits for fiscal year 2011 corresponded to income by holdings and just a fraction corresponded to the realized and liquid profits meeting the requirements to be distributed as per Section 68 of the Corporations Law, and taking as well into consideration Grupo Financiero Galicias financial condition for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, at the shareholders meeting held on April 19, 2012, our shareholders approved the payment of -133- Table of Contents dividends in cash for Ps.17.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, which represents 1.4% for the 1,241,407,017 class A and B ordinary shares with a face value of Ps.1 each. Taking into consideration the above policy, regulatory framework and Grupo Financiero Galicias financial situation, as well as its profits for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, the shareholders meeting held on April 15, 2013 approved the distribution of cash dividends for Ps.24.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 which represents 1.9% with regard to 1,241,407,017 class A and B ordinary shares with a face value of Ps.1 each. Pursuant to the section incorporated after Section 25 of Act No. 23,966, Grupo Financiero Galicia will receive the reimbursement of tax withholdings related to the taxes paid on behalf of the shareholders subject to the tax on personal assets as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, Grupo Financiero Galicia, on an individual basis, had cash and due from banks in an amount of Ps.0.4 million and short-term investments in an amount of Ps.11.57 million. Grupo Financiero Galicias short-term investments were made up of: (i) special checking account deposits of Ps.0.77 million, (ii) investments in mutual funds of Ps.3.66 million, (iii) public and private bonds for Ps.3.89 million, (iv) Grupo Financiero Galicias stake in GV Mandataria (in liquidation) for Ps.0.02 million and (v) Grupo Financiero Galicias stake in Galval for Ps.3.5 million. As of December 31, 2011, Grupo Financiero Galicia, on an individual basis, had cash and due from banks of Ps.0.9 million and short-term investments of Ps.59.4 million. Grupo Financiero Galicias short-term investments were made up of: (i) special checking account deposits of Ps.55.9 million and (ii) investments in mutual funds of Ps.3.5 million. As of December 31, 2010, Grupo Financiero Galicia, on an individual basis, had cash and due from banks of Ps.0.8 million and short-term investments of Ps.26.5 million. Grupo Financiero Galicias short-term investments were made up of: (i) special checking account deposits of Ps.24.8 million, (ii) time deposits of Ps.0.5 million, and (iii) investments in mutual funds of Ps.1.2 million. On January 6, 2009, the remaining outstanding of US$62 million was cancelled in advance, with a single and final payment of US$39.1 million, with our own funds and funds from financing granted by local entities. On March 9, 2009, our shareholders held the general ordinary shareholders meeting during which they approved the creation of a global program for simple notes, not convertible into shares, for a maximum principal amount of US$60.0 million. On June 4, 2009 Series I and Series II notes corresponding to the Class I notes were issued in the amount of US$45.0 million. Series I, with a one-year term, was issued for a principal amount of US$34.4 million and a yield of 8%; Series II, with a two-year term, was issued for a principal amount of US$10.6 million and an annual yield of 10.5%. With the proceeds of these issuances, we proceeded to cancel the funding from local entities. On April 14, 2010, Grupo Financiero Galicias shareholders held the ordinary and extraordinary shareholders meeting during which they approved an extension of US$40 million in the amount of the global program of simple short-, medium- and/or long- term notes. Therefore, the maximum amount of the program, which was originally set at US$60.0 million or its equivalent in any other currency, was increased to US$100.0 million or its equivalent in any other currency. The extraordinary shareholders meeting held in August 2012 ratified the extension previously approved by the ordinary and extraordinary shareholders meeting held in April 2010 with regard to the approval of the US$40.0 million increase in the amount of Grupo Financiero Galicias global program. Furthermore, during fiscal year 2010 Grupo Financiero Galicia made an offer of notes for a face value of US$45.0 million. The subscription period for such notes ended on June 4, 2010; the notes were fully subscribed for and Grupo Financiero Galicia decided not to issue the Series I notes, which were planned to be issued at a discount. The cut-off rate for the Series II notes was 101.82%, for a face value of US$18.1 million, equivalent to a 7% annual yield. With respect to the Series III notes, the cut-off rate was 101.28%, for a face value of US$26.9 million, equivalent to an 8.5% annual yield. Accordingly, during fiscal year 2010, Grupo Financiero Galicia repaid, upon maturity, the Class I, Series I notes for US$34.4 million. During 2011, Grupo Financiero Galicia repaid, upon maturity, Class I, Series II notes for US$10.6 million and during fiscal year 2012 Grupo Financiero Galicia also repaid upon maturity Class II, Series II notes for US$18.1 million. -134- Table of Contents On August 28, 2012, Grupo Financiero Galicia issued Class III notes, for a face value amount of Ps.78.1 million, with a variable interest rate equal to the Benchmark Rate (BADLAR) plus 3.59% and with a maturity date of February 28, 2014. The aggregate principal amount of such notes will be repaid upon maturity. Each of our subsidiaries is responsible for their own liquidity management.

Banco Galicias Liquidity Management Banco Galicia Consolidated Liquidity Gaps Liquidity risk is the risk that liquid assets are not available for Banco Galicia to meet financial commitments at contractual maturity, take advantage of potential investment opportunities and meet demand for credit. To monitor and control liquidity risk, Banco Galicia monitors and systematically calculates the gaps between financial assets and liabilities maturing within set time intervals based on contractual remaining maturity, on a consolidated basis with the Regional Credit Card Companies and CFA. All of the deposits in checking accounts and other demand deposits and deposits in savings accounts are included in the first time interval. These figures are used to simulate different liquidity crisis scenarios based on assumptions stemming from historical experience. As of December 31, 2012, the consolidated gaps between maturities of Banco Galicias financial assets and liabilities based on contractual remaining maturity were as follows As of December 31, 2012 (1) Less thanone Year 1  5Years 5  10Years Over 10Years Total (in millions of Pesos, except ratios) Assets Cash and Due from Banks 2,875.5    2,875.5 Argentine Central Bank  Escrow Accounts 6,062.7    6,062.7 Overnight Placements 277.5    277.5 Loans  Public Sector 339.5    339.5 Loans  Private Sector 34,959.8 6,483.1 137.5 13.3 41,593.7 Government Securities 3,038.4 503.1   3,541.5 Notes and Corporate Securities 95.7 87.3 25.0  208.0 Financial Trusts 607.6 779.4 126.0 0.9 1,513.9 Special Fund Former Almafuerte Bank  166.1   166.1 Other Financing 309.9    309.9 Receivables from Financial Leases 240.2 329.2 36.7  606.1 Other 465.9    465.9 Total Assets 49,272.7 8,348.2 325.1 14.2 57,960.2 Liabilities Savings Accounts 9,250.5    9,250.5 Demand Deposits 10,526.3    10,526.3 Time Deposits 19,683.7 255.2 0.1  19,939.0 Notes 977.5 2,661.4 1,464.2  5,103.1 International Banks and Credit Agencies 343.2 249.0 1.0  593.2 Domestic Banks 987.4 159.4 3.4  1,150.2 Other Liabilities (1) 7,423.7    7,423.7 Total Liabilities 49,192.4 3,325.0 1,468.7  53,986.0 Asset / Liability Gap 80.3 5,023.2 (1,143.6 ) 14.2 3,974.2 Cumulative Gap 80.3 5,103.5 3,959.9 3,974.1 3,974.2 Ratio of Cumulative Gap to Cumulative Liabilities 0.2 % 9.7 % 7.3 % 7.4 % Ratio of Cumulative Gap to Total Liabilities 0.2 % 9.5 % 7.3 % 7.4 % -137- Table of Contents Principal plus CER adjustment. Does not include interest. (1) Includes, mainly, debt with retailers due to credit card operations, liabilities in connection with repurchase transactions, debt with domestic credit agencies and collections for third parties. The Less than One Year bucket also includes Ps.6.6 million corresponding to Banco Galicias foreign debt not tendered by its holders in the exchange offered to restructure such foreign debt, which was completed in May 2004. The table above is prepared taking into account contractual maturity. Therefore, all financial assets and liabilities with no maturity date are included in the Less than One Year category. Banco Galicia must comply with a maximum limit set by its board of directors for liquidity mismatches. This limit has been established at -25% (minus 25%) for the ratio of cumulative gap to total liabilities within the first year. As shown in the table above, Banco Galicia complies with the established policy, since such gap was 0.2% as of December 31, 2012. Banco Galicia (Unconsolidated) Liquidity Management The following is a discussion of Banco Galicias liquidity management, excluding the consolidated companies. Banco Galicias policy is to maintain a level of liquid assets that allows it to meet financial commitments at contractual maturity, take advantage of potential investment opportunities, and meet customers credit demand. To set the appropriate level, forecasts are made based on historical experience and on an analysis of possible scenarios. This enables management to project funding needs and alternative funding sources, as well as excess liquidity and placement strategies for such funds. As of December 31, 2012, Banco Galicias unconsolidated liquidity structure was as follows: As of December 31, 2012 (in millions of Pesos) Legal Requirement Ps. 5,809.7 Management Liquidity 5,634.9 Total Liquidity (1) Ps. 11,444.6 (1) Excludes cash and due from banks of consolidated companies. The legal liquidity requirements in the table above correspond to the Minimum Cash Requirements for Peso- and Dollar-denominated liabilities determined by Argentine Central Bank regulations. For more information on the Argentine Central Bank regulations regarding reserve requirements for liquidity purposes, see Item 4. Information on the Company-Argentine Banking Regulation-Legal Reserve Requirements for Liquidity Purposes. The assets included in this calculation are the balances of Peso- and Dollar-denominated deposit accounts at the Argentine Central Bank and escrow accounts held at the Argentine Central Bank in favor of clearing houses. Management liquidity consists of the following items: (i) 100% of the balance of overnight placements in banks abroad, (ii) 90% of the Lebac balance, (iii) 90% of the market value of available government securities, due to -138- Table of Contents the potential liquidity that might be obtained through sales or repurchase transactions, (iv) net short-term interbank loans (call loans), and (vi) 100% of the balance at the Argentine Central Bank, including escrow accounts in favor of clearing houses, in excess of the amounts necessary to cover the Minimum Cash Requirements Capital Our capital management policy is designed to ensure prudent levels of capital. The following table analyzes our capital resources as of the dates indicated.

Syndics and alternate syndics are elected at the ordinary shareholders meeting for a one-year term and they can be re-elected. Alternate syndics act in the temporary or permanent absence of a syndic. The table below shows the composition of Banco Galicias Supervisory Committee as they were re-elected by the annual shareholders meeting held on April 15, 2013.

Garda Olaciregui, Norberto D. Corizzo, Luis A. Díaz, Fernando Noetinger and Miguel N. Armando and Horacio Tedín, see -Our Supervisory Committee. Compensation of Banco Galicias Directors and Officers Banco Galicias board of directors establishes the policy for compensation of Banco Galicias personnel. Banco Galicias managers receive a fixed compensation and they may receive a variable compensation, based on their performance. Five directors and an alternate director are employees of Banco Galicia and, therefore, receive a fixed compensation and may also receive a variable compensation based on their performance, provided that these additional payments do not exceed the standard levels of similar entities in the Argentine financial market, a provision that is applicable to managers as well. The compensation regime includes the possibility of acquiring a retirement insurance policy. Banco Galicia does not maintain stock-option plans or pension plans or any other retirement plans for the benefit of its directors and managers. Banco Galicia does not have a policy establishing any termination benefits for its directors. For fiscal year 2012, Banco Galicias ordinary shareholders meeting held on April 15, 2013, approved compensation for the directors in the total amount of Ps.0.85 million. Annually, provisions are established to cover the variable compensation of Banco Galicias board of directors and employees for the fiscal year. During the first quarter of each year, Banco Galicias board of directors analyzes the possibility of paying employees a variable compensation for the previous fiscal year ended based on the compensation for similar jobs in the labor market in recognition of the performance and professional development of the respective beneficiaries during the fiscal year.

Within the current legal framework, membership in an employee union is voluntary and there is only one union of bank employees with national representation. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 19.6% of Banco Galicias employees were affiliated with the national bank employee union. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 95.8% of the Regional Credit Card Companies work force was party to the merchant unions Collective Bargaining Agreement No. 130/75 applicable to trade employees, 4.5% of which were members of a labor union and 0.03% of which were labor union representatives. As of December 31, 2012, CFAs employees were not affiliated to any union. Usually during the first four months of the year, the bank employee union and the national commerce employee union renegotiate their respective collective labor agreements in order to establish new minimum wages. As a result of such negotiations, salary increases are granted. Banco Galicia has not experienced a strike by its employees since 1973 and the Regional Credit Card Companies and CFA have never experienced any strike event. We believe that our relationship with our employees has developed within normal and satisfactory parameters. -152- Table of Contents We have a human resources policy that aims at providing our employees possibilities for growth and personal and socio-economic achievement. We will continue our current policy of monitoring both wage levels and labor conditions in the financial industry in order to be competitive. Our employees receive fixed compensation and may receive variable compensation according to their level of achievement. We do not maintain any profit-sharing programs for our employees. The Fundación Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires (the Fundación) is an Argentine non-profit organization that provides various services to Banco Galicia employees. The various activities of the Fundación include, among others, purchasing school materials for the children of Banco Galicias employees and making donations to hospitals and other charitable causes, including cultural events. The Fundación is managed by a Council, certain members and alternate members of which are members of our Board of Directors and supervisory committee. Members and alternate members of the Council do not receive remuneration for their services as trustees. Nasdaq Corporate Governance Standards Pursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5615(a) (3), a foreign private issuer may follow home country corporate governance practices in lieu of the requirements of the Rule 5600 Series, provided that the foreign private issuer complies with certain sections of the Rule 5000 Series, discloses each requirement that it does not follow and describes the home relevant country practice followed in lieu of such requirement. The requirements of the Rule 5000 Series and the Argentine corporate governance practice that we follow in lieu thereof are described below: (i) Rule 5250 (d)  Distribution of Annual and Interim Reports. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5250 (d), we follow Argentine law, which requires that companies make public a Spanish language annual report, including annual audited consolidated financial statements, by filing such annual report with the CNV and the BASE, within 70 calendar days of the end of the companys fiscal year. Interim reports must be filed with the CNV and the BASE within 42 calendar days of the end of each fiscal quarter. The BASE publishes the annual reports and interim reports in the BASE bulletin and makes the bulletin available for inspection at its offices. In addition, our shareholders can receive copies of our annual reports and any interim reports upon such shareholders request. English language translations of our annual reports and interim reports are furnished to the SEC. We also post the English language translation of our annual reports and quarterly press releases on our website. Furthermore, under the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement, dated as of June 22, 2000, among us, The Bank of New York, as depositary, and owners of ADSs issued thereunder, we are required to furnish The Bank of New York with, among other things, English language translations of our annual reports and each of our quarterly press releases. Annual reports and quarterly press releases are available for inspection by ADRs holders at the offices of The Bank of New York located at, 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York. Finally, Argentine law requires that 20 calendar days before the date of a shareholders meeting, the board of directors must provide to the shareholders, at the companys executive office or through electronic means, all information relevant to the shareholders meeting, including copies of any documents to be considered by the shareholders (which includes the annual report), as well as proposals of the companys board of directors. (ii) Rule 5605 (b) (1)  Majority of Independent Directors. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5605 (b) (1), we follow Argentine law, which does not require that a majority of the board of directors be comprised of independent directors. Argentine law instead requires that public companies in Argentina such as us must have a sufficient number of independent directors to be able to form an audit committee of at least three members, the majority of which must be independent pursuant to the criteria established by the CNV. In addition, because we are a controlled company as defined in Rule 5615 (c) (1), we are relying on the exemption provided thereby for purposes of complying with Rule 5615 (c) (2). (iii) Rule 5605 (b) (2)  Executive Sessions of Independent Directors. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5605 (b) (2), we follow Argentine law which does not require independent directors to hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only such independent directors are present (i.e., executive sessions). Our Board of Directors as a whole is responsible for monitoring our affairs. In addition, under Argentine law, the board of directors may approve the delegation of specific responsibilities to designated directors or non-director managers of the company. Also, it is mandatory for public companies to form a supervisory committee (composed of syndics), which is responsible for monitoring the legality of the companys actions under Argentine law and the conformity thereof with its bylaws. -153- Table of Contents (iv) Rule 5605 (d)  Compensation of Officers. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5605 (d), we follow Argentine law, which does not require companies to form a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. It also is not required in Argentine law that the compensation of the chief executive officer and all other executive officers be determined by either a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. Under Argentine law, the board of directors is the corporate body responsible for determining the compensation of the chief executive officer and all other executive officers, so long as they are not directors. In addition, under Argentine law, the audit committee shall give its opinion about the reasonableness of managements proposals on fees and option plans for directors or managers of the company. Finally, because we are a controlled company as defined in Rule 5615 (c) (1), we are relying on the exemption provided thereby for purposes of complying with Rule 5615 (c) (2). (v) Rule 5605 (e) (1)  Nomination of Directors. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5605 (e) (1), we follow Argentine law which requires that directors be nominated directly by the shareholders at the shareholders meeting and that they be selected and recommended by the shareholders themselves. Under Argentine law, it is the responsibility of the ordinary shareholders meeting to appoint and remove directors and to set their compensation. In addition, because we are a controlled company as defined in Rule 5615 (c) (1), we are relying on the exemption provided thereby for purposes of complying with Rule 5615 (c) (2). (vi) Rule 5605 (c) (1)  Audit Committee Charter. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5605 (c) (1), we follow Argentine law, which requires that audit committees have a charter but does not require that companies certify as to the adoption of the charter nor does it require an annual review and assessment thereof. Argentine law instead requires that companies prepare a proposed plan or course of action with respect to those matters, which are the responsibility of the companys audit committee. Such plan or course of action could, at the discretion of our audit committee, include a review and assessment of the audit committee charter. (vii) Rule 5605 (c) (2)  Audit Committee Composition. Argentine law does not require, and it is equally not customary business practice in Argentina, that companies have an audit committee comprised solely of independent directors. Argentine law instead requires that companies establish an audit committee with at least three members comprised of a majority of independent directors as defined by Argentine law. Nonetheless, although not required by Argentine law, until April 19, 2012, we had an Audit Committee entirely comprised of three independent directors, pursuant to the definition of independence in Rule 10 A-3 (b) (1), one of which the Board of Directors determined to be a financial expert. Currently, our Audit Committee is comprised of three Directors; two of which meet such independent requirements. In addition, we have a supervisory committee (comisión fiscalizadora) composed of three syndics, which are in charge of monitoring the legality, under Argentine law, of the actions of our Board of Directors and the conformity of such actions with our bylaws. (viii) Rule 5620 (c)  Quorum. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5620 (c), we follow Argentine law and our bylaws, which distinguish between ordinary meetings and extraordinary meetings and require, in connection with ordinary meetings, that a quorum consist of a majority of stock entitled to vote. If no quorum is present at the first meeting, a second meeting may be called at which the shareholders present, whatever their number, constitute a quorum and resolutions may be adopted by an absolute majority of the votes present. Argentine law and our bylaws require, in connection with extraordinary meetings, that a quorum consist of 60% of the stock entitled to vote. However, if such quorum is not present at the first meeting, our bylaws provide that a second meeting may be called which may be held with the number of shareholders present. In both ordinary and extraordinary meetings, decisions are adopted by an absolute majority of votes present at the meeting, except for certain fundamental matters (such as mergers and spin-offs (when we are not the surviving entity and the surviving entity is not listed on any stock exchange), anticipated liquidation, a change in our domicile to outside of Argentina, total or partial recapitalization of our statutory capital following a loss, any transformation in our corporate legal form or a substantial change in our corporate purpose) which require an approval by vote of the majority of all the stock entitled to vote (all stock being entitled to only one vote). -154- Table of Contents (ix) Rule 5620 (b)  Solicitation of Proxies. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5620 (b), we follow Argentine law which requires that notices of shareholders meetings be published, for five consecutive days, in the Official Gazette and in a widely circulated newspaper in Argentina no earlier than 45 calendar days prior to the meeting and at least 20 calendar days prior to such meeting. In order to attend a meeting and be listed on the meeting registry, shareholders are required to submit evidence of their book-entry share account held at Caja de Valores S.A. (Caja de Valores) up to three business days prior to the scheduled meeting date. If entitled to attend the meeting, a shareholder may be represented by proxy (properly executed and delivered with a certified signature) granted to any other person, with the exception of a director, syndic, member of the surveillance committee (consejo de vigilancia), manager or employee of the issuer, which are prohibited by Argentine law from acting as proxies. In addition, our ADRs holders receive, prior to the shareholders meeting, a notice listing the matters on the agenda, a copy of the annual report and a voting card. (x) Rule 5630 (a)  Conflicts of Interest. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5630 (a), we follow Argentine law which requires that related party transactions be approved by the audit committee when the transaction exceeds one percent (1%) of the corporations net worth, measured pursuant to the last audited balance sheet, so long as the relevant transaction exceeds the equivalent of three hundred thousand Argentine Pesos (Ps.300,000). Directors can contract with the corporation only on terms consistent with prevailing market terms. If the contract is not in accordance with prevailing market terms, such transaction must be pre-approved by the board of directors (excluding the interested director). In addition, under Argentine law, a shareholder is required to abstain from voting on a business transaction in which its interests may be in conflict with the interests of the company. In the event such shareholder votes on such business transaction and such business transaction would not have been approved without such shareholders vote, such shareholder may be liable to the company for damages and the resolution may be declared void. Other than as noted above, we are in full compliance with all other applicable Nasdaq corporate governance standards.

Members of the Escasany family have been on the board of directors of Banco Galicia since 1923. The Ayerza and Braun families have been represented on Banco Galicias board of directors since 1943 and 1947, respectively. Currently, there is one member of these families on Banco Galicias board of directors and five members of these families on our Board of Directors. In addition, there is one alternate director on our Board of Directors that is member of the controlling families. On September 13, 1999, the controlling shareholders of Banco Galicia formed EBA Holding S.A., an Argentine corporation, which is 100% owned by our controlling shareholders. EBA Holding holds 100% of our class A shares. Currently, EBA Holding only has class A shares outstanding. EBA Holdings bylaws provide for certain restrictions on the sale or transfer of its class A shares. While the class A shares of EBA Holding may be transferred to any other class A shareholder of EBA Holding, any transfer of such class A shares to third parties would automatically result in the conversion of the sold shares into class B shares of EBA Holding having one vote per share. In addition, EBA Holdings bylaws contain rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions and tag-along rights. A public shareholder of Banco Galicia, who indirectly owns approximately 4.5% of the outstanding capital stock of Banco Galicia, has granted a right of first refusal for the purchase of all or part of its shares to certain of our controlling shareholders in the event such public shareholder decides to sell all or part of its Banco Galicia shares. As of December 31, 2012, we had 45 identified United States record shareholders (not considering The Bank of New York), of which 16 held our class B shares and 29held our ADSs. Such United States holders, in the aggregate, held approximately 95 million of our class B shares, representing approximately 7.7% of our total outstanding capital stock as of such date.
