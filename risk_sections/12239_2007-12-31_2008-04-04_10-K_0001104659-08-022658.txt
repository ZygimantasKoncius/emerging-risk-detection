Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Any of the risk factors we describe below could severely harm our business, financial condition and operating results. The market price of our common stock could decline if one or more of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS WE DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BECOME A FULL SCALE BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT A NECESSARY BUYER/LICENSEE/PARTNER. We intend to continue to develop Naturlose as a viable Type 2 diabetes treatment and to continuously seek a sale, license or partner. Our hope and expectation is that as we proceed with the development, incremental successes may allow us to negotiate a favorable transaction. There can be no assurance, however, that we will have such incremental successes, or that even if we achieve them, we will attract a buyer, licensee or partner. We have limited resources and we may fully expend our funds before we are able to attract a purchaser/partner. WE HAVE NOT YET SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZED NATURLOSE. We are in the process of attempting to develop the use of tagatose in non-food products, under the brand name Naturlose, as a treatment for diabetes. Efforts are limited to the Type 2 diabetes clinical trial because of cash limitations. To date, we have yet to secure any substantial revenue from tagatose (Naturlose) sales. OUR SOLE DRUG CANDIDATE IS STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND REMAINS SUBJECT TO CLINICAL TESTING AND REGULATORY APPROVAL. THIS PROCESS IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND WE MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO OBTAIN MARKETING APPROVAL FOR OUR DRUG CANDIDATE. To date, we have not obtained approval from the FDA or any foreign regulatory authority to market or sell Naturlose as a drug for Type 2 diabetes. We have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA and/or comparable foreign regulatory agencies. The time required to complete clinical trials and for regulatory review by the FDA and other countries regulatory agencies is uncertain and typically takes several years. IF CLINICAL TRIALS OF NATURLOSE ARE PROLONGED, DELAYED OR SUSPENDED, IT MAY TAKE SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER AND COST SUBSTANTIALLY MORE TO OBTAIN MARKETING APPROVAL FOR OUR DRUG CANDIDATE AND ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY, IF AT ALL. We have already encountered several challenges which have delayed our Phase 3 trial. Each delay makes it more likely that we will need interim financing to complete the Phase 3 trial. We cannot predict whether we will encounter additional problems with our trial that will cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend the clinical trial, or delay the analysis of data from ongoing trial. Any of the following could delay the clinical development of Naturlose as a drug: · ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding the scope or design of our trial; · delays in receiving, or the inability to obtain, required approvals from reviewing entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our trial; · delays in enrolling patients into the trial; · a lower than anticipated retention rate of patients in the trial; 7 · the need to repeat the trial as a result of inconclusive or negative results or unforeseen complications in testing; · inadequate supply or deficient quality of materials necessary to conduct our trial; · serious and unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials; · the placement by the FDA of a clinical hold on a trial; or · any restrictions on or post-approval commitments with regard to any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain that render the drug candidate not commercially viable. WE CURRENTLY RELY ON THIRD PARTIES TO CONDUCT OUR TRIAL, AND THOSE THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT PERFORM SATISFACTORILY. We rely on third parties to enroll qualified patients, conduct our trial, provide services in connection with such trial, and coordinate and oversee all aspects of the trial. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities. Accordingly, these third party contractors may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or the trial design. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be required to replace them or we may be required to provide these services with our own personnel. Although we believe there are a number of third party contractors we could engage to continue these activities, replacing a third party contractor may result in a delay or affect the trial. If this were to occur, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our drug candidates may be delayed. EVEN IF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS ARE SUCCESSFUL, WE MAY NOT HAVE A COMMERCIALLY VIABLE DRUG OR PRODUCT. We have a number of hurdles to overcome to have a commercially viable drug or product even assuming our clinical trials are successful, including: · We must secure a manufacturer of Naturlose. Our food/beverage licensee, which also has the right to manufacture tagatose/Naturlose, has ceased its manufacturing efforts. We have engaged in some preliminary discussions with firms that have expressed some interest but we have no firm commitment. · We must demonstrate that the product will be accepted in the market place. Even if the clinical trial is successful, the market may not accept a drug which must be consumed in liquid form, three times a day, and in the quantities used in our trial. IF PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS DO NOT ACCEPT NATURLOSE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES FROM PRODUCT SALES. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for Naturlose, it may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community for a variety of reasons including: · timing of market introduction of competitive drugs; · lower demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other drugs; · lack of cost-effectiveness; · lack of availability of reimbursement from managed care plans and other third-party payors; · inconvenient and/or difficult administration; · prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; · potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; · safety concerns with similar drugs marketed by others; · the reluctance of the target population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies; and · ineffective sales, marketing and distribution support. If Naturlose fails to achieve market acceptance, we would not be able to generate significant revenue or achieve profitability. BIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS HAS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS. THE DEFENSE OF ANY PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIM BROUGHT AGAINST US WILL DIVERT MANAGEMENT TIME AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE. We could be exposed to significant potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, manufacture, sales and marketing of drugs and related products. Our insurance may not, however, provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Furthermore, product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to maintain current amounts of insurance coverage or obtain additional or sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect against losses 8 that could have a material adverse effect on us. If a claim is brought against us, we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim, as well as uncovered damage awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us. Furthermore, whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims, we might be required to redirect significant financial and managerial resources to such defense, and adverse publicity is likely to result. OUR PATENT PROTECTION MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT US. Our current use patent for Naturlose as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes expires in 2012. We are exploring the prospects of extending the life of the patent and developing a new patentable production process of Naturlose. There is no assurance, however, that either effort will be successful. WE HAVE SUSTAINED LOSSES IN THE PAST AND WE MAY SUSTAIN LOSSES IN THE FUTURE. We have incurred losses from continuing operations in prior years, including 2007 and 2006. Our net losses from continuing operations before taxes for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $9.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively. We expect to incur substantial losses in 2008 and thereafter until we find a purchaser/licensee. We may not return to profitable operations. See discussion on Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NEEDED. In recent years, we have funded our operations through private placements of our common stock, through the exercise of warrants issued in connection with such private placement transactions and through the sale of the InfoSpherix subsidiary. We believe that if the Company experiences significant delays with the Phase 3 clinical trial or encounters significant and unexpected costs that the Company will need to raise additional funding to continue to finance our product development operations. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain required financing may cause us to curtail or cease our operations. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR NEWLY-FORMED HEALTH SCIENCES CONSULTING BUSINESS. In August 2007, we launched a new Health Sciences consulting business when we hired Dr. Claire Kruger as our CEO. Dr. Kruger is operating this business with a modest staff and is also directing our Phase 3 trial. There can be no assurance that this venture will be successful. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RETAIN OUR KEY EXECUTIVES AND PERSONNEL. As a small company, our success depends on the services of key employees in executive and other positions. The loss of the services of one or more of such employees could have a material adverse effect on us. WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION BY COMPETITORS. Our competitors in the biotechnology products business are numerous. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. Our competitors may succeed in developing or marketing biotechnology products that are more effective than ours. RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK THE PRICE OF SPHERIXS COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN HIGHLY VOLATILE DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO EFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK. Our common stock has traded as low as $1.03 and as high as $3.15 between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007. Some of the factors leading to this volatility include: · relatively small amounts of our stock trading on any given day; · fluctuations in our operating results; · announcements of technological innovations or new products which we or our competitors make; · developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights. OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE DELISTED FROM NASDAQ GLOBAL MARKET SYSTEM IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH CONTINUED LISTING STANDARDS. We were previously advised that we were in danger of our common stock being delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market due to our stockholders equity falling below the $10 million minimum requirement. At December 31, 2007, the Companys shareholders equity was $14.5 million. Further, we are in danger of failing to meet the minimum $1 per share stock price requirement. If at some point we are unable to meet the listing standards, we will attempt to list our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market, but we may not qualify for such listing. 9 DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK ARE NOT LIKELY. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, in order to provide funds for use in the operation and expansion of our business and for further research and development. Accordingly, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Investors must look solely to appreciation in the market price of the shares of our common stock to obtain a return on their investment. BECAUSE OF THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT AND ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS, A THIRD PARTY MAY BE DISCOURAGED FROM MAKING A TAKEOVER OFFER WHICH COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. In 2001, we adopted a shareholder rights plan. The effect of this rights plan and of certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us or replacing members of our board of directors, even if the acquisition or the replacements would be beneficial to our stockholders. These factors could also reduce the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of the common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions. INSIDERS OWN A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH COULD LIMIT OUR STOCKHOLDERS ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF KEY TRANSACTIONS. As of December 31, 2007, our officers and directors and their affiliates owned approximately 18% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, our officers and directors are able to exert considerable influence over the outcome of any matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock, including the election of our Board of Directors. The voting power of these stockholders could prevent or frustrate attempts to effect a transaction that is in the best interests of the other stockholders and could also discourage others from seeking to purchase our common stock, which might depress the price of our common stock.
