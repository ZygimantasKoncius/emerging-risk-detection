D. Risk Factors for additional information concerning risks related to our business, strategy and operations. Cash Flows During the year ended December 31, 2011, consolidated cash and cash equivalents decreased by $1.6 billion due primarily to increased deposits in Fiat Industrial subsidiaries cash management pools. Cash and cash equivalents at Equipment Operations decreased by $1,683 million, while cash and cash equivalents at Financial Services increased by $120 million. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Equipment Operations $ 1,097 $ 1,811 $ 1,145 Financial Services (18 ) (12 ) 1,220 Eliminations (85 ) (397 ) (153 ) Consolidated $ 994 $ 1,402 $ 2,212 Equipment Operations generated $1,097 million of cash flows from operations in 2011, primarily due to net income of $924 million partially offset by cash used to fund working capital requirements to meet market demand. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily related to a decrease of $975 million in cash from working capital in 2011. 55 Table of Contents The utilization of cash in operating activities at Financial Services in 2011 resulted primarily from cash reduction of $340 million from increases in accounts receivable, partially offset by net income of $225 million. Equipment Operations generated $1,811 million of cash flows from operations in 2010, primarily due to $1,000 million in cash flows from working capital reductions, adjustments for depreciation and amortization expense of $291 million, and 2010 net income of $438 million. Cash provided by working capital reductions includes $323 million from inventory reductions and $506 million from an increase in payables, partially offset by $84 million due to higher receivables. The primary driver of the working capital reduction in 2010 was the stronger market demand reducing the levels of finished goods inventory. The cash generated from operations was also attributable to the increase of $416 million in other liabilities, primarily related to higher levels of taxes payable and accrued payroll. The increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 reflects the year-over-year increase in net income. The utilization of cash for operating activities at Financial Services in 2010 resulted primarily from cash reduction of $203 million from increases in wholesale accounts receivable, partially offset by net income of $159 million. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to cash inflows as the result of significant reductions in receivables during 2009. Equipment Operations generated $1,145 million of cash flows from operations in 2009, primarily due to $1,200 million in cash flows from working capital reductions. Cash provided by working capital reductions was comprised of $809 million from receivable reductions and $1,360 million from inventory reductions, primarily offset by reduced payables of $969 million. The primary drivers of the working capital reductions in 2009 were the lower revenues and demand, and the sale of receivables to Financial Services. The cash provided by working capital reductions was partially offset by the impact of the 2009 net loss of $222 million and an increase in prepayments and other current assets related to higher levels of tax receivables. Financial Services generated $1,220 million of cash from operating activities in 2009, resulting primarily from $858 million in cash from decreases in dealer and other accounts receivable, net income of $174 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $128 million. The decrease in receivables was attributable to the increase in sales of receivables to the ABS markets under the accounting guidance in effect during that period. Cash Flows from Investing Activities For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Equipment Operations $ (2,884 ) $ 168 $ (691 ) Financial Services (666 ) (234 ) 1,924 Eliminations  20  Consolidated $ (3,550 ) $ (46 ) $ 1,233 Cash flow used by investing activities at Equipment Operations in 2011 was primarily attributable to deposits of $2,400 million cash in Fiat Industrial subsidiaries cash management pools and capital expenditures of $408 million. The decrease in cash from investing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to $2,400 million in deposits in Fiat Industrial subsidiaries cash management pools in 2011, compared to withdrawals from Fiat subsidiaries cash management pools of $481 million in 2010. Cash flow used by investing activities at Financial Services in 2011 was a result of $5,582 million of additions to retail receivables and $394 million in expenditures for equipment on operating leases, partially offset by cash generated from the $5,106 million of collections of retail receivables and $241 million proceeds from 56 Table of Contents sale of equipment on operating lease. Cash flow used by investing activities at Financial Services increased by $432 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the activities in retail receivables. Cash provided by investing activities at Equipment Operations in 2010 resulted from withdrawals from Fiat subsidiaries cash management pools of $481 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $301 million. The increase in cash from investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to $451 million in deposits in Fiat subsidiaries cash management pools in 2009, compared to withdrawals of $481 million in 2010 as we deposited a greater portion of our cash with third party banks prior to the demerger. Cash flow used by investing activities at Financial Services in 2010 totaled $234 million resulting from $365 million in expenditures for equipment on operating leases and a $219 million increase in restricted cash, partially offset by net collections of retail receivables of $77 million and proceeds from the sale of equipment on operating lease of $270 million. We adopted new accounting guidance related to the accounting for transfers of financial assets and the consolidation of VIEs at the beginning of 2010. Under this accounting guidance, certain securitization transactions are now accounted for as secured borrowings rather than asset sales. The cash flows from these securitization transactions were presented as investing activities in 2009 and as financing activities in 2010. Total investing cash flows related to retail receivables and securitization transactions decreased $1,585 million compared to 2009 primarily as a result of this new accounting guidance. The utilization of cash in investing activities at Equipment Operations in 2009 reflected capital expenditures of $217 million and an increase in deposits in Fiat subsidiaries cash management pools of $451 million. Capital expenditures were principally related to initiatives to introduce new products and enhance manufacturing efficiency. Cash provided by investing activities at Financial Services in 2009 totaled $1,924 million, resulting from proceeds from retail securitizations of $3,775 million, collections of retail receivables of $4,466 million, proceeds from the sale of equipment on operating leases of $140 million, $107 million for retained interests, and withdrawals from Fiat subsidiaries cash management pools of $289 million. Partially offsetting these sources of cash were $6,552 million of investments in retail receivables and $302 million investments in equipment on operating leases. Net cash provided from securitization transactions in 2009 was $1,796 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Equipment Operations $ 152 $ 626 $ (356 ) Financial Services 832 (57 ) (2,766 ) Eliminations 85 377 153 Consolidated $ 1,069 $ 946 $ (2,969 ) Cash provided by financing activities at Equipment Operations in 2011 primarily resulted from $391 million cash generated from collections of intersegment notes from Financial Services, partially offset by net payment of $292 million related to long-term borrowings. The decrease of cash provided by financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to a net reduction in borrowings in 2011. Cash flows provided by financing activities for Financial Services in 2011 were attributable to net proceeds of $1,063 million from long-term borrowings and $277 million from short-term borrowings, partially offset by a reduction of $391 million in intersegment borrowings from Equipment Operations. The increase in cash flows used by financing activities at Financial Services in 2011 as compared to 2010 was a net effect of $766 million more cash from borrowings and $312 million less dividend distributions in 2011. 57 Table of Contents Cash provided by financing activities at Equipment Operations in 2010 is primarily attributable to net proceeds of $381 million from long-term borrowings and $254 million in cash collections of intersegment notes from Financial Services. The increase of cash provided by financing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to a net reduction in borrowings in 2009. Cash flows used by financing activities for Financial Services in 2010 of $57 million primarily reflects dividend payments of $397 million to Equipment Operations and cash payment of $254 million to Equipment Operations to repay intersegment notes payable, partially offset by net proceeds of $574 million from long-term and short-term borrowings. The improvement in cash flows used by financing activities at Financial Services in 2010 from 2009 was primarily due to the net proceeds from borrowings in 2010 compared with a $1,937 million reduction of long-term and short-term borrowings in 2009. Equipment Operations cash flows used by financing activities in 2009 of $356 million primarily reflected the use of $1,017 million in cash to reduce short-term and long-term borrowings, partially offset by $676 million in cash received for the reduction of intersegment notes from Financial Services. Cash flows used by financing activities for Financial Services in 2009 of $2,766 million primarily reflected a reduction in short-term and long-term borrowings of $1,937 million, in addition to cash used to reduce intercompany notes from Equipment Operations of $676 million. Sources of Funding Funding Policy In the continuing environment of uncertainty in the financial markets, our policy is to keep a high degree of flexibility with our funding and investment options in order to maintain our desired level of liquidity. In managing our liquidity requirements, we are pursuing a financing strategy that includes open access to a variety of financing sources. These sources include U.S. and international capital markets, commercial bank lines, and the funding of Financial Services with a combination of receivables securitizations, unsecured borrowings, conduit financing, and other transactions. A summary of our strategy is set forth below:  To fund Equipment Operations short-term financing requirements and to ensure near-term liquidity, Equipment Operations will continue to sell its receivables to Financial Services and rely primarily on internal cash flows including managing working capital. We also maintain a funding relationship with Fiat Industrial through term loans and cash management arrangements operated by Fiat Industrial treasury subsidiaries in a number of jurisdictions. We may also supplement our short-term financing by entering into new credit lines with banks.  As funding needs of Equipment Operations are determined to be of a longer-term nature, we may access public medium- and long-term debt markets as well as private investors and banks, as appropriate, to refinance borrowings and replenish our liquidity.  Financial Services funding strategy is to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity and flexible access to a wide variety of financial instruments. We expect securitizations to continue to represent a substantial portion of our capital structure. However, we will further diversify our funding sources and expand our investor base within the Financial Services plan to create a stand-alone funding profile and achieve investment grade credit ratings. We will continue to look at the public ABS market as an important source of funding in North America and Australia. In addition to our current funding and liquidity sources, which include a combination of term receivables, securitizations, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured and secured borrowings, we expect changes to our funding profile as costs and terms of accessing the unsecured term market improve. In addition to offering unsecured notes and to accessing unsecured committed bank facilities in 2011, Financial Services will continue to evaluate 58 Table of Contents financing alternatives to further diversify its funding base. We will tailor our offerings to improve investor interest in our securities while optimizing economic factors and reducing execution risks.  Financial Services in Brazil continues to utilize financing provided by BNDES to support the growth of the agricultural and construction equipment sectors of the economy and to continue the issuance of certificates of deposit.  Financial Services has also relied in the past, and may continue to rely, on intersegment borrowings from Equipment Operations and financing from Fiat Industrial. On a global level, we will continue to evaluate alternatives to ensure that Financial Services has access to capital on favorable terms to support its business, including agreements with global or regional partners similar to our agreement with BNP Paribas Lease Group, new funding arrangements or a combination of the foregoing. Prior to 2009, a significant portion of our financing has historically come from Fiat and Fiat subsidiaries. As a consequence of the demerger, all the financing arrangements with Fiat treasury subsidiaries outstanding as of December 31, 2010 were assigned to Fiat Industrial treasury subsidiaries effective as of January 1, 2011. The assignment of term financings took place with the execution of tri-party agreements between the relevant Fiat treasury subsidiaries (which transferred the financial receivables), Fiat Industrial treasury subsidiaries (which received the receivables) and CNH entities (which acknowledged the transfer). As a result of these assignments, CNH entities had no residual financing with Fiat treasury subsidiaries as of January 1, 2011. Our access to external sources of financing, as well as the cost of financing, is dependent on various factors, including our unsecured debt ratings. As of February 9, 2012, our long-term unsecured debt was rated BB+ by S&P; Ba2 by Moodys; and BBB Low by DBRS. Fiat Industrials long-term unsecured debt was rated BB+ (negative outlook) by S&P and Ba1 by Moodys. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. A deterioration in our ratings could impair our ability to obtain debt financing and would increase the cost of such financing. Debt ratings are influenced by a number of factors, including, among others: our parent companys ratings, financial leverage on an absolute basis or relative to peers, the composition of the balance sheet and/or capital structure, material changes in earnings trends and volatility, ability to dividend monies from subsidiaries and our competitive position. Material deterioration in any one, or a combination, of these factors could result in a downgrade of our debt ratings, thus increasing the cost, and limiting the availability, of unsecured financing. Consolidated Debt As of December 31, 2011, and 2010, our consolidated debt was as detailed in the table below: Consolidated EquipmentOperations Financial Services 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 (in millions) Long-term debt excluding current maturities $ 8,626 $ 8,540 $ 3,572 $ 3,660 $ 6,251 $ 5,933 Current maturities of long-term debt 4,412 3,894 682 818 3,730 3,076 Short-term debt 4,072 3,863 239 177 5,322 5,468 Total debt $ 17,110 $ 16,297 4,493 $ 4,655 15,303 $ 14,477 On December 31, 2011, our outstanding consolidated debt with Fiat Industrial and its subsidiaries was $639 million, or 3.7% of our consolidated debt, compared to $778 million or 4.8% with Fiat and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010. The reduction was mainly due to Financial Services repaying part of its debt from Fiat Industrial. 59 Table of Contents We believe that Net Debt, defined as total debt less intersegment notes receivable, deposits in Fiat Industrial subsidiaries cash management pools and cash and cash equivalents, is a useful analytical tool for measuring our effective borrowing requirements. Our ratio of Net Debt to Net Capitalization provides useful supplementary information to investors so that they may evaluate our financial performance using the same measures we use. Net Capitalization is defined as the sum of Net Debt and Total Equity. Net Debt and Net Capitalization are non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should neither be considered as a substitute for, nor superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The calculation of Net Debt and Net Debt to Net Capitalization as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the reconciliation of Net Debt to Total Debt, the U.S. GAAP financial measures that we believe to be most directly comparable, are shown below: Consolidated EquipmentOperations Financial Services 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 (in millions, except percentages) Total debt $ 17,110 $ 16,297 $ 4,493 $ 4,655 $ 15,303 $ 14,477 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 2,055 3,618 1,251 2,934 804 684 Deposits with Fiat Industrial 4,116  3,980  136  Deposits with Fiat  1,760  1,643  117 Intersegment notes receivables   1,993 2,273 693 562 Net debt (cash) 10,939 10,919 (2,731 ) (2,195 ) 13,670 13,114 Total equity 7,924 7,380 7,923 7,379 2,046 2,008 Net capitalization $ 18,863 $ 18,299 5,192 $ 5,184 15,716 $ 15,122 Net debt (cash) to net capitalization 58 % 60 % (53 )% (42 )% 87 % 87 % The following table computes Total Debt to Total Capitalization, the U.S. GAAP financial measure which we believe to be most directly comparable to Net Debt to Net Capitalization.

The increase in Financial Services Net Debt in 2011 reflected higher managed receivables portfolios. Long term debt As of December 31, 2011, our consolidated long-term debt was $13.0 billion, including $4.4 billion of current maturities, compared to $12.4 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2010. Equipment Operations long-term debt as of December 31, 2011 was $4.3 billion, including $682 million of current maturities, and consisted of bonds in the aggregate amount of approximately $2.8 billion, intersegment notes in the amount of $598 million, medium-term loans and borrowings under credit facilities with third parties 60 Table of Contents and Fiat Industrial in the aggregate amount of $548 million, and advances under the syndicated credit facility in the amount of $300 million. As of December 31, 2011, Financial Services long-term debt was $10 billion, including $3.7 billion of current maturities, and consisted of $6.9 billion of debt related to securitizations, $896 million of borrowings under committed credit lines related to our retail lending activities in Brazil, $606 million of asset-backed facilities, $599 million of intersegment notes, $500 million of unsecured notes, $311 million of borrowings from Fiat Industrial and third parties, and $150 million of unsecured debt from a bank. A more detailed description of our long-term debt is provided under Note 9: Credit Facilities and Debt to our consolidated financial statements for year ended December 31, 2011. Short Term Debt As of December 31, 2011, our consolidated short-term debt was $4.1 billion, compared to $3.9 billion as of the end of 2010. Equipment Operations short-term debt as of December 31, 2011 was $239 million and consisted mainly of $95 million of intersegment notes, $80 million from Fiat Industrial, and $64 million of advances under credit facilities. As of December 31, 2011, Financial Services short-term debt was $5.3 billion, including $3.3 billion financed under asset-backed facilities, $1.4 billion of intersegment notes and $0.6 billion of borrowings from Fiat Industrial and third parties. A more detailed description of our short-term debt is provided under Note 9: Credit Facilities and Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Credit Facilities As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $4.6 billion available under our $10.6 billion total lines of credit (including asset-backed facilities), including $6.0 billion of asset-backed facilities, $2.6 billion of credit lines with Fiat Industrial, $1.9 billion of committed lines, and $0.1 billion of uncommitted lines. Of the total $6.0 billion drawn under such lines, $3.7 billion was classified as short term debt, $1.2 billion was classified as current maturities of long-term debt and $1.1 billion was classified as long-term debt. A more detailed description of our credit facilities is provided under Note 9: Credit Facilities and Debt to our consolidated financial statements. 61 Table of Contents Cash and cash equivalents, Deposits with Fiat Industrial and Intersegment notes receivable Cash and cash equivalents were $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2011, compared to $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2010. The following table shows cash and cash equivalents, together with additional information on deposits with Fiat Industrial (in 2011) and Fiat (in 2010) and intersegment notes receivable, which together contribute to our definition of Net Debt as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Consolidated EquipmentOperations Financial Services 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,055 $ 3,618 $ 1,251 $ 2,934 $ 804 $ 684 Deposits with Fiat Industrial $ 4,116 $  $ 3,980 $  $ 136 $  Deposits with Fiat $  $ 1,760 $  $ 1,643 $  $ 117 Intersegment notes receivable: Current $  $  $ 1,394 $ 1,730 $ 95 $ 52 Long-term   599 543 598 510 Total intersegment notes receivables $  $  $ 1,993 $ 2,273 $ 693 $ 562 The amount of deposits with Fiat Industrial and cash and cash equivalents held by us on a consolidated basis fluctuates daily. The ratio of cash and cash equivalents to deposits with Fiat Industrial also varies, as a function of the cash flows of our subsidiaries that participate in the various cash pooling systems managed by Fiat Industrial worldwide. At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $4.1 billion of cash deposited in the Fiat Industrial treasury subsidiaries cash management pools, compared with $1.8 billion of cash deposited in the Fiat Treasury subsidiaries cash management pools at the end of 2010. The total amount deposited in the Fiat Industrial treasury subsidiaries cash management pools as of December 31, 2011, included $1.8 billion deposited by our subsidiaries in the United States and in Canada and $2.3 billion deposited by certain of our European subsidiaries. Further to the demerger, we entered into new cash management arrangements with Fiat Industrial treasury subsidiaries effective on January 1, 2011. Our cash deposits in Fiat treasury subsidiaries cash management pools as of December 31, 2010 were assigned to the Fiat Industrial treasury subsidiaries cash management pools effective as of January 1, 2011. Accordingly, no residual cash balances were outstanding with Fiat treasury subsidiaries cash management pool as of close of business January 1, 2011. As at December 31, 2011, CNH had approximately $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared to approximately $3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2010. The amount as of December 31, 2010 included approximately $2 billion of funds which would have historically been deposited with the relevant cash management pools managed by Fiat treasury subsidiaries in the U.S. and in Europe. In anticipation of the demerger, at the end of 2010, these funds were deposited with primary financial institutions in Europe and the U.S. for a short-term period. In the month of January 2011, these funds were deposited with the applicable Fiat Industrial subsidiaries cash management pools. Securitization As part of our overall funding strategy, we periodically transfer certain financial receivables into VIEs that are special purpose entities (SPEs) as part of our asset-backed securitization programs. SPEs utilized in the securitization programs differ from other entities included in our consolidated financial statements because the assets they hold are legally isolated. For bankruptcy analysis purposes, we have sold the 62 Table of Contents receivables to the SPEs in a true sale and the SPEs are separate legal entities. Upon transfer of the receivables to the SPEs, the receivables and certain cash flows derived from them become restricted for use in meeting obligations to the SPEs creditors. The SPEs have ownership of cash balances that also have restrictions for the SPEs investors. Our interests in the SPEs receivables are subordinate to the interests of third-party investors. None of the receivables that are directly or indirectly sold or transferred in any of these transactions are available to pay our creditors. The following table summarizes the restricted and off-book receivables and the related retained interests as of December 31, 2011 and 2010: RestrictedReceivables Off-BookReceivables RetainedInterest 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 (in millions) North America retail receivables $ 5,501 $ 4,922 $ 108 $ 206 $ 18 $ 39 North America wholesale receivables 2,884 2,694     Europe wholesale receivables 1,193 1,051 2 8   Australia retail receivables 932 936     Australia wholesale receivables 101 123     North America revolving account receivables 181 193     Total $ 10,792 $ 9,919 $ 110 $ 214 $ 18 $ 39 Wholesale Receivables Securitizations With regard to the wholesale receivable securitization programs, we sell eligible receivables on a revolving basis, to structured master trust facilities which are limited purpose, bankruptcy-remote SPEs. As of December 31, 2011, the U.S. master trust facility consists of $583 million term asset-backed notes issued in August 2009 with a three-year maturity, $220 million term asset-backed notes issued January 2011 with a two-year maturity and four 364-day conduit facilities renewable annually at the sole discretion of the purchasers; $200 million renewable March 2012, $500 million renewable July 2012, $250 million renewable November 2012, and $200 million renewable November 2012. The Canadian master trust facility consists of a C$586 million ($574 million) conduit facility renewable December 2012 at the sole discretion of the purchaser. The Australian master trust facility consists of a 364-day A$200 million ($203 million) conduit facility renewable December 2012 at the sole discretion of the purchaser. These trusts were determined to be VIEs and, consequently we consolidate the securitization trusts. In our role as servicer, we have the power to direct the trusts activities and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the trusts. We are the primary beneficiary of the trusts, and therefore the trusts were consolidated. Our involvement with the securitization trusts includes originating and servicing the wholesale receivables, retaining an undivided interest (sellers interest) in the receivables and maintaining cash reserve accounts. The sellers interest in the trusts represents CNHs undivided interest in the receivables transferred to the trust. We maintain cash reserve accounts at predetermined amounts to provide security to investors in the event that cash collections from the receivables are not sufficient to remit principal and interest payments on the securities. The investors and the securitization trusts have no recourse to us beyond our retained interests for failure of debtors to pay when due. Our retained interests are subordinate to investors interests. For the U.S. wholesale securitization facility, in the year ended December, 31, 2009, we recognized gains on the sale of receivables of $51 million. Collections reinvested into the facility in the year ended December, 31, 63 Table of Contents 2009 were $5,629 million. At December 31, 2009, there were no recognized servicing assets or liabilities associated with the U.S. facility. Each of the facilities contains minimum payment rates and/or portfolio performance thresholds which, if breached, could preclude us from selling additional receivables originated on a prospective basis. In addition, we have various factoring programs for the revolving sale to third party factors of wholesale receivables originated in Europe. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the amount of outstanding receivables under these factoring programs were 1.0 billion ($1.3 billion) and 874 million ($1.2 billion), respectively, of which 922 million ($1.2 billion) and 786 million ($1.1 billion), respectively, were recorded as secured borrowings and included in the consolidated balance sheets. Retail Receivables Securitizations Within the U.S. retail asset securitization programs, eligible retail finance receivables are sold to limited purpose, bankruptcy-remote SPEs. In turn, these SPEs establish separate trusts to which the receivables are transferred in exchange for proceeds from asset-backed securities issued by the trusts. In Canada, the receivables are transferred directly to the SPEs. These trusts were determined to be VIEs and, consequently, we consolidated all previously unconsolidated retail trusts upon the January 1, 2010 adoption of the new accounting guidance related to transfers of financial assets and the consolidation of VIEs. In our role as servicer, we have the power to direct the trusts activities. Through our retained interests, we have an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the trusts. During both years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we issued $3.5 billion in retail asset-backed securities in the U.S., Canada and Australia. The securities in these transactions are backed by agricultural and construction equipment retail receivable contracts and finance leases originated through our dealer network. We applied any proceeds from the securitizations to repay outstanding debt. At December 31, 2011, $5.7 billion of asset-backed securities issued to investors were outstanding with a weighted average expected remaining maturity between 25 and 37 months. At December 31, 2010, $10.9 billion of asset-backed securities issued to investors were outstanding with a weighted average expected remaining maturity between 26 and 36 months. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we securitized retail receivables with a net principal value of $4.0 billion and recognized gains on these sales of receivables of $68 million. Further, related to the retail securitizations, we received proceeds of $3,732 million and recorded $31 million in servicing fees for the year ended December 31, 2009. We receive compensation for servicing the receivables transferred and earn other related ongoing income customary with the securitization programs. We may also retain all or a portion of subordinated interests in the SPEs. No recourse provisions exist that allow holders of the asset-backed securities issued by the trusts to put those securities back to us, although we provide customary representations and warranties that could give rise to an obligation to repurchase from the trusts any receivables for which there is a breach of the representations and warranties. Moreover, we do not guarantee any securities issued by the trusts. The trusts have a limited life and generally terminate upon final distribution of amounts owed to investors or upon exercise of a cleanup-call option by us, in our role as servicer. CNH also has access to $2.1 billion committed asset-backed facilities through which it may sell retail receivables generated by Financial Services in the United States, Canada, and Australia. CNH has utilized these facilities in the past to fund the origination of receivables and have later repurchased and resold the receivables in the term ABS markets or found alternative financing for the receivables. CNH believes that it is probable that the vast majority of newly originated receivables will continue to be repurchased and resold in the public ABS markets. These facilities had an original term of two years and are renewable in December 2012 and December 2013. 64 Table of Contents Three private retail transactions totaling $108 million and $206 million were not included in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These transactions continue to qualify as sales subsequent to the adoption of the new accounting guidance. Therefore, as these receivables are collected, the amount of off-book receivables will decrease. Revolving Charge Account Securitizations Through a trust, CNH securitizes originated revolving charge account receivables through a privately owned two year facility. The trusts facility limit is $200 million and is renewable in October 2012. Consistent with the wholesale and retail securitization programs, we determined that the trust was a VIE and therefore, it was consolidated in our balance sheets. Our continuing involvement with the securitization trust includes servicing the receivables and maintaining a cash reserve account, which provides security to investors in the event that cash collections from the receivables are not sufficient to remit principal and interest payments to the investors. The investors and the securitization trust have no recourse to us beyond our retained interest assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. Further, our retained interests are subordinate to the investors interests. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized gains of $10 million on the sale of receivables and collections reinvested into the facility were $705 million. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension Benefit Obligations Plan assets are primarily held in trusts and invested to provide for current and future pension benefits. Plan assets primarily consist of investments in equity securities, debt securities, and cash. The funded status of our pension benefit obligations is the difference between our plan assets and our actuarially determined plan obligations. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, our pension plans had an underfunded status of approximately $731 million and $736 million, respectively. These amounts included pension plan obligations for plans that we are not currently required to fund of $418 million and $451 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. During 2011, we made a discretionary contribution of $70 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan trust. In 2012, we anticipate making a discretionary contribution of up to $70 million to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan trust. Based on projections of minimum funding requirements, we do not anticipate that any additional contributions for this plan will be required during the period 2013 through 2016. We will continue to consider making discretionary contributions to our pension and other benefit plans in the future. During 2011, we contributed $55 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans and we anticipate that we will make contributions to such plans in 2012 of approximately $53 million. Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations These benefit obligations are currently unfunded although we continue to evaluate making discretionary contributions. At both December 31, 2011 and 2010, our other postretirement benefit obligations had an underfunded status of $1.1 billion. During 2011 and 2010, we did not make any voluntary contributions to our postretirement benefit plans; however, we made benefit payments of $63 million and $74 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively. We anticipate that cash requirements for other postretirement employee benefits will be approximately $88 million in 2012. 65 Table of Contents See Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsA. Operating ResultsApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates, as well as Note 12: Employee Benefit Plans and Postretirement Benefits to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 for additional information on pension and other postretirement benefits accounting. C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc. Our research, development and engineering personnel design, engineer, manufacture and test new products, components, and systems. We incurred $526 million, $451 million, and $398 million of research and development costs in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Agricultural EquipmentWe are marketing the New Holland, Case IH and Steyr brands and logos as the primary brand names for our agricultural equipment products. Construction EquipmentFor construction equipment under New Holland, we are marketing the New Holland and Kobelco brands in particular regions of the world. For construction equipment under Case, we are promoting the Case construction brand name and trademark. Most of these brand names have been registered as trademarks in the principal markets in which we use them. Other than the New Holland, Case and Case IH trademarks, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks. We also sell some products under heritage brand names or sub-brand names such as Braud, FiatAllis, Flexi-Coil, Austoft, Concord, DMI and Tyler. Through our Case IH and New Holland brands in agricultural equipment and Case and New Holland Construction brands in construction equipment, we have a significant tradition of technological innovation in the agricultural and construction equipment industries. As of December 31, 2011, we hold over 4,365 patents and over 1,112 additional applications are pending. We believe that we are among the market leaders for the number of patents in the product classes in which we compete. D. Trend Information See Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsA.

Liquidity and Capital Resources, including: Key Trends for 2011, Key Trends for 2012 and 2011 Compared to 2010. E. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We disclose our off-balance sheet arrangements in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and have incorporated a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements into our discussion of liquidity and capital resources. Please see Note 3: Accounts and Notes Receivable, and Note 14: Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 and Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsB. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesSecuritization for a detailed description of our off-balance sheet arrangements. 66 Table of Contents F. Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth the aggregate amounts of our contractual obligations and commitments with definitive payment terms that will require significant cash outlays in the future. The commitment amounts as of December 31, 2011, are as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years After5 years (in millions) Long-term debt $ 13,038 $ 4,412 $ 4,685 $ 2,297 $ 1,644 Interest on fixed rate debt(1) 1,769 433 690 510 136 Interest on floating rate debt(1) 1,602 326 595 549 132 Operating leases(2) 153 32 42 36 43 Purchase obligations 400 400    Tax contingencies(3) 55 55    Total contractual cash obligations $ 17,017 $ 5,658 $ 6,012 $ 3,392 $ 1,955 (1) The interest funding requirements are based on 2011 interest rates and the assumption that short-term debt will be renewed for the next five years. (2) Minimum rental commitments. (3) The total amount of gross tax contingencies, including positions impacting only the timing of tax benefits was $305 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Payment of these liabilities would result from settlements with taxing authorities. Because of the high degree of uncertainty relating to the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to reasonably estimate beyond one year when settlement will occur with respective taxing authorities. Other Liabilities While our funding policy requires contributions to our defined benefit pension plans equal to the amounts necessary to, at a minimum, satisfy the funding requirements as prescribed by the laws and regulations of each country, we do make discretionary contributions when management determines it is prudent to do so. For 2012, we anticipate making total discretionary contributions to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans of up to $70 million, and anticipate making contributions to our other defined benefit pension plans of approximately $53 million prior to consideration of any discretionary contributions. Our other postretirement benefit plans are currently unfunded although we continue to evaluate making discretionary contributions. We are required to make contributions equal to the amount of current plan expenditures, less participant contributions. For 2012, we anticipate making contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans of approximately $88 million prior to consideration of any discretionary contributions. G. Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this filing, including statements regarding our: competitive strengths; business strategy; future financial position or operating results; budgets; projections with respect to revenue, income, earnings (or loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure or other financial items; costs; and plans and objectives of management regarding operations and products, are forward-looking statements. These statements may include terminology such as may, will, expect, could, should, intend, estimate, anticipate, believe, outlook, continue, remain, on track, design, target, objective, goal, or similar terminology. 67 Table of Contents Our outlook is largely based on our interpretation of what we consider to be relevant economic assumptions and involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ (possibly materially) from such forward-looking statements. Macro-economic factors including monetary policy, interest rates, currency exchange rates, inflation, deflation, credit availability and the intervention by governments and non-governmental organizations in an attempt to influence such factors can have a material impact on our customers and the demand for our goods. Crop production and commodity prices are strongly affected by weather and can fluctuate significantly. Housing starts and other construction activity are sensitive to, among other things, credit availability, interest rates and government spending. Some of the other significant factors that may affect our results include general economic and capital market conditions, the cyclical nature of our businesses, customer buying patterns and preferences, the impact of changes in geographical sales mix and product sales mix, foreign currency exchange rate movements, our hedging practices, investment returns, our and our customers access to credit, restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, actions by rating agencies concerning the ratings on our debt and asset-backed securities and the credit ratings of Fiat Industrial, risks related to our relationship with Fiat Industrial the effect of the demerger transaction consummated by Fiat pursuant to which CNH was separated from Fiats automotive business and became a subsidiary of Fiat Industrial, political uncertainty and civil unrest or war in various areas of the world, pricing, product initiatives and other actions taken by competitors, disruptions in production capacity, excess inventory levels, the effect of changes in laws and regulations (including those related to tax, healthcare, retiree benefits, government subsidies, engine emissions, and international trade regulations), the results of legal proceedings, technological difficulties, results of our research and development activities, changes in environmental laws, employee and labor relations, pension and health care costs, relations with and the financial strength of dealers, the cost and availability of supplies, raw material costs and availability, energy prices, real estate values, animal diseases, crop pests, harvest yields, government farm programs, consumer confidence, housing starts and construction activity, concerns related to modified organisms and fuel and fertilizer costs, and the growth of non-food uses for some crops (including ethanol and biodiesel production). Additionally, our achievement of the anticipated benefits of our margin improvement initiatives depends upon, among other things, industry volumes as well as our ability to effectively rationalize our operations and to execute our brand strategy. Furthermore, in light of ongoing difficult macroeconomic conditions, both globally and in the industries in which we operate, it is particularly difficult to forecast our results and any estimates or forecasts of particular periods that we provide are uncertain. We can give no assurance that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by the factors we disclose that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements. 68 Table of Contents Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees A.

See CNH Directors Compensation Plan and Share Ownership below. Directors who are employees of a Fiat Industrial Group company or a Fiat Group company do not receive compensation from us. CNH Directors Compensation Plan The CNH Global N.V. Directors Compensation Plan (CNH Directors Plan) provides for the payment of: (1) an annual retainer fee of $100,000; (2) an Audit Committee membership fee of $20,000; (3) a Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee membership fee of $15,000; (4) an Audit Committee chair fee of $35,000; and (5) a Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee chair fee of $25,000 (collectively, the Fees) to eligible directors of CNH in the form of cash, and/or common shares of CNH, and/or options to purchase common shares of CNH. The CNH Directors Plan provides for the payment of the Fees to eligible members of the Board of CNH, provided that such members do not receive salary or other 74 Table of Contents employment compensation from CNH, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or Fiat Group or Fiat Industrial Group companies. Each quarter of the CNH Directors Plan year, the eligible directors elect the form of payment of their Fees. If the elected form is common shares, the eligible director will receive as many common shares as are equal to the amount of Fees the director elects to forego, divided by the fair market value of a common share. Common shares issued vest immediately upon grant, but cannot be sold for a period of six months. If the elected form is options, the eligible director will receive as many options as the amount of Fees that the director elects to forego, multiplied by four and divided by the fair market value of a common share. Such fair market value being equal to the average of the highest and lowest sale price of a common share on the last trading day of each quarter of the CNH Directors Plan year on the NYSE. Stock options granted as a result of such an election vest immediately upon grant, but shares purchased under options cannot be sold for six months following the date of exercise. Stock options terminate upon the earlier of: (1) ten years after the grant date; or (2) six months after the date an individual ceases to be a director. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were 690,993 and 693,914 common shares, respectively, reserved for issuance under the CNH Directors Plan.

C. Board Practices Responsibility for overseeing the management of the Company lies with our Board of Directors, which determines our policies and the general course of corporate affairs. The members of the Board are elected at the meeting of shareholders, serve for a term of approximately one year, and stand for re-election every year. See Item 6A. Directors, Senior Management and Employees above. We are subject to, among other things, both the laws of The Netherlands and the laws and regulations applicable to foreign private issuers in the U.S. The Dutch Corporate Governance Code (the Dutch Code), which became effective as of January 1, 2004, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the NYSE listing standards are also of particular significance to our corporate governance. We describe the significant differences between our corporate governance practices and those required of domestic companies by the NYSE listing standards under Item 16G. Corporate Governance. 75 Table of Contents We have a one-tier management structure (i.e. a management board which may be comprised of both members having responsibility for our day-to-day operations, who are referred to as executive directors, and members not having such responsibility, referred to as non-executive directors). A majority of our Board consists of non-executive directors, who meet the independence requirements of the Dutch Code. The Board believes that it is appropriate for the role of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman to be separate, and that the Chairman of the Board should be a non-executive director. Should an executive director be appointed as Chairman, the Board will also designate a non-executive director as the lead director, who will chair executive sessions of the Board. For information regarding the period of time our directors have served, see Item 6A. Directors, Senior Management and EmployeesDirectors and Senior Management. None of our directors have service contracts with the Company (or any subsidiary) providing for benefits upon termination of employment as a director. We currently have an Audit Committee and a Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee which are described in more detail below. During 2011, there were seven meetings of our Board of Directors. Attendance at these meetings was 95%. The Audit Committee met eight times during 2011 and attendance of directors at those meetings was 97%. The Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee met four times during 2011 with 100% attendance of directors at such meetings. The Board of Directors and the Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee have each discussed the performance of the Board and its committees. The Audit Committee discusses, among other things, our risk assessment and management processes. The work plan of the Audit Committee provides that this assessment will take place annually. The Board also typically schedules one annual meeting that is devoted to discussing our strategy (this meeting did not take place in 2011). Audit Committee. Our Audit Committee is appointed by the Board to assist in monitoring (1) the integrity of our financial statements, (2) qualifications and independence of our independent registered public accounting firm, (3) the performance of our internal audit function and our independent registered public accounting firm, (4) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (5) the system of internal controls that management and the Board of Directors have established, and (6) it reviews and approves, if appropriate, any related party transactions and transactions under which any director could have a material conflict of interest. Directors are required to immediately report any actual or potential conflict of interest that is of material significance to us or to themselves. The Audit Committee currently consists of Messrs. Theurillat, Colligan, Kalantzis, and Lanaway. The Audit Committee is currently chaired by Mr. Theurillat. At its meetings, the Audit Committee customarily meets with the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, the Chief Accounting Officer, the Vice President of Internal Audit, the Vice President Corporate Tax, the Treasurer, and representatives from our independent registered public accounting firm. After such meetings, the Audit Committee routinely meets separately, in executive session, with the Chief Financial Officer, the Internal Auditor and representatives from our independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, at least once per year (and more often as necessary) the Audit Committee meets with representatives from our independent registered public accounting firm without any management present. The Charter for the Audit Committee is available on our web site (www.cnh.com). The information contained on our web site is not included in, or incorporated by reference into, this annual report on Form 20-F. Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee. The Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee is responsible for, among other things, the design, development, implementation and review of the compensation and terms of employment of our executive officers and the fees paid to the members of the Board as well as succession planning issues relating to executive officers and directors. The Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee is responsible for making sure that the compensation of the companys executive personnel is related to and aligned with our (and our shareholders) short-term and long-term objectives and our operating performance. The directors compensation terms and conditions are set forth in the CNH Directors Plan, the terms of which are approved by our shareholders. The Corporate Governance and Compensation 76 Table of Contents Committee makes its recommendations to the Board. The Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee also advises the Board on candidates for the Board for a first appointment, to fill a vacancy, and on members for the Board for possible reappointment after each term. The Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee currently consists of Messrs. Houle, Hiler, Jeker, Lipper and Marchionne. The Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee is currently chaired by Mr. Houle. The Charter for the Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee is available on our web site (www.cnh.com). For a discussion of certain provisions of our Articles of Association applicable to our Board, see Item 10. Additional InformationMemorandum and Articles of Association. D.

Unions represent many of our production and maintenance employees. Our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, which represents approximately 1,300 of our hourly production and maintenance employees in the United States continues through April 2016. The International Association of Machinists, which represents approximately 780 of our employees in Fargo, North Dakota, ratified a contract in October 2006, which expires in April 2012. We will begin negotiating with the International Association of Machinists in late March with an anticipated contract ratification in April 2012. Our employees in Europe are also covered by laws that afford employees, through local and central works councils, certain rights of information and consultation with respect to matters involving the business and operations of their employers, including the downsizing or closure of facilities and the termination of employment. Over the years, we have experienced various work slow-downs, stoppages and other labor disruptions. E. Share Ownership Collectively, our directors and executive officers beneficially own, or were granted options with respect to, less than one percent of our common shares. Directors elective option awards vest immediately upon grant. Directors options terminate six months after a director leaves the Board of Directors if not exercised. In any event, directors options terminate if not exercised by the tenth anniversary of the grant date. 77 Table of Contents Options issued to eligible directors are issued from the CNH Directors Plan.
