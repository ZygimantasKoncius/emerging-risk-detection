Information is provided herein with respect to our operations related to our fiscal years ended on January 28, 2006 (fiscal 2005), January 29, 2005 (fiscal 2004) and January 31, 2004 (fiscal 2003). ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview and History We are a rapidly growing, value-priced retailer of urban fashion apparel and accessories for the entire family. We offer quality, branded products from nationally recognized brands, as well as private label products and a limited assortment of home décor items. Our merchandise offerings are designed to appeal to the preferences of fashion conscious consumers, particularly African-Americans. We believe that we provide merchandise at compelling values. Our goal is to provide nationally recognized branded merchandise at 20% to 60% discounts to department and specialty stores regular prices. Our stores average approximately 9,000 square feet of selling space and are typically located in neighborhood shopping centers that are convenient to low- to moderate-income customers. Originally our stores were located in the Southeast, and during late fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 were expanded into the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions and Texas. As of January 28, 2006, we operated 235 stores (including one store closed due to the hurricanes) in both urban and rural markets in 14 states. In fiscal 2005, we opened 36 new stores. Our predecessor, Allied Department Stores, was founded in 1946 and grew into a chain of family apparel stores operating in the Southeast. In 1999, the Companys chain of stores, then consisting of 85 stores throughout the Southeast, was acquired by Hampshire Equity Partners II, L.P., a private equity firm. Following the acquisition by Hampshire Equity Partners II, L. P., management implemented several strategies, which are discussed below, to refocus us on the growing urban market and improve our operating and financial performance. After the successful implementation of these strategies and the successful growth of our chain of stores from 85 stores to 212 stores, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock on May 17, 2005. Our executive offices are located at 102 Fahm Street, Savannah, Georgia 31401 and our telephone number is 912-236-1561. Our Internet address is http//www.cititrends.com. The reference to our web site address in this report does not constitute the incorporation by reference of the information contained at the web site in this report. We make available, free of charge through publication on our web site, a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and any current reports on Form 8-K or amendments to those reports, filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed such materials with, or furnished such materials to, the SEC. In addition, you may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549 or on the SECs web site at http://www.sec.gov, and you may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Company Strengths and Strategies Our goal is to be the leading value-priced retailer of urban fashion apparel and accessories. We believe the following business strengths differentiate us from our competitors and are important to our success: Focus on Urban Fashion Mix. We focus our merchandise on urban fashions, which we believe appeals to our core customers. We do not attempt to dictate trends, but rather devote considerable effort to identifying emerging trends and ensuring that our apparel assortment is considered timely and fashionable in the urban market. Our merchandising staff tests new merchandise before reordering and actively manages the mix of brands and products in the stores to keep our offering fresh and minimize markdowns. Superior Value Proposition. As a value-priced retailer, we seek to offer top quality, fashionable merchandise at compelling prices. We seek to provide nationally recognized brands at 20% to 60% discounts to department and specialty stores regular prices. We also offer products under our proprietary brands such as Citi Steps, Diva Blue and Urban Sophistication. These private labels enable us to expand our product selection, offer fashion merchandise at lower prices and enhance our product offerings. Merchandise Mix that Appeals to the Entire Family. We merchandise our stores to create a destination environment capable of 3 meeting the fashion needs of the entire value-conscious family. Each store offers a wide variety of products for men and women, as well as infants, toddlers, boys and girls. Our stores feature sportswear, dresses, plus-sized apparel, outerwear, footwear and accessories, as well as a limited assortment of home décor items. We believe that the breadth of our merchandise distinguishes our stores from many competitors that offer urban apparel primarily for women, and reduces our exposure to fashion trends and demand cycles in any single category. Strong and Flexible Sourcing Relationships. We maintain strong sourcing relationships with a large group of suppliers. We have purchased merchandise from more than 1,000 vendors in the past 12 months. Purchasing is controlled by a 20-plus member buying team located at our Savannah, Georgia headquarters and in New York, New York, that has on average more than 20 years of retail experience. We purchase merchandise through planned programs with vendors at reduced prices and opportunistically through close-outs, with the majority of our merchandise purchased for the current season and a limited quantity held for sale in future seasons. To foster vendor relationships, we pay vendors promptly and do not ask for typical retail concessions such as promotional and markdown allowances or delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores. Attractive Fashion Presentation and Store Environment. We seek to provide a fashion-focused shopping environment that is similar to a specialty apparel retailer, rather than a typical off-price store. Products from nationally recognized brands are prominently displayed by brand, rather than by size, on dedicated, four-way fixtures featuring multiple sizes and styles. The remaining merchandise is arranged on hanging racks. The stores are carpeted and well-lit, with most featuring a sound system that plays urban adult and urban contemporary music throughout the store. Nearly all of our stores have either been opened or remodeled in the past six years. Highly Profitable Store Model. We operate a proven and efficient store model that delivers strong cash flow and store level return on investment. We locate stores in high traffic strip shopping centers that are convenient to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. We generally utilize previously occupied store sites which enables us to obtain attractive rents for our store sites. Similarly, advertising expenses are low as we do not rely on promotion-driven sales but rather seek to build our reputation for value through everyday low prices. At the same time, from an investment perspective, we seek to design stores that are inviting and easy to shop, while limiting startup and fixturing costs. As a result, our stores have generated rapid payback of investments, typically within 12 to 14 months. Product Merchandising and Pricing Products. Our merchandising policy is to offer high quality, branded products at attractive prices for the entire value-conscious family. We seek to maintain a diverse assortment of first quality, in-season merchandise that appeals to the distinctive tastes and preferences of our core customers. Approximately 40% of our sales are typically represented by nationally recognized brands that we purchase from approximately 30 to 50 vendors. We also offer a wide variety of products from less recognized brands that represent approximately 50% of our sales. The remaining 10% of sales represent private label products under our proprietary brands such as Citi StepsTM, Diva BlueTM and Urban SophisticationTM. Our private label products enable us to expand product selection, offer merchandise at lower prices and enhance our product offerings. Our merchandise includes apparel, accessories and home décor. Within apparel, we offer mens, womens, which includes dresses, sportswear and plus-sized offerings, and childrens, which includes offerings for infants, toddlers, boys and girls. We also offer accessories, which includes intimate apparel, handbags, hats, jewelry, footwear, toys, belts and sleepwear, as well as a limited assortment of home décor, which includes giftware, lamps, pictures, mirrors and figurines. The following table sets forth the approximate merchandise assortment by classification as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. Percentage of Net Sales 2005 2004 Womens 38 % 38 % Childrens 25 % 27 % Mens 22 % 21 % Accessories 13 % 13 % Home décor 2 % 1 % Pricing. We purchase our merchandise at attractive prices and mark prices up less than department or specialty stores. We seek to provide nationally recognized brands at prices 20% to 60% below regular retail prices available in department stores and specialty stores, and to provide a product offering that validates both our value and fashion positioning to our consumers. We also consider the 4 price-to-value relationships of our non-branded products to be strong. Our basic pricing strategy is everyday low prices. The discount from the suggested retail price is usually reflected on the price tag. We review each department in our stores at least monthly for possible markdowns based on sales rates and fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of inventory and to accelerate the flow of current merchandise. Sourcing and Allocation The merchandising department oversees the sourcing and allocation of merchandise to our stores, which allows us to utilize volume purchase discounts and maintain control over our inventory. We source our merchandise from over 1,000 vendors, consisting of domestic manufacturers and importers. Our President and Chief Merchandising Officer supervises an 18-member planning and allocation team, as well as a buying team, which is comprised of four merchandise managers and 19 buyers. Our buyers have on average more than 20 years of experience in the retail business and have developed long-standing relationships with many of our vendors, including those controlling the distribution of branded apparel. Our buyers, who are based in Savannah and New York, travel regularly to the major United States apparel markets, visiting major manufacturers and attending national and regional apparel trade shows, including urban-focused trade shows. Our buyers purchase merchandise in styles, sizes and quantities to meet inventory levels developed by the planning staff. We work closely with our suppliers and are able to differentiate ourselves by our willingness to purchase less than a full assortment of styles, colors and sizes and by our policy of paying promptly and not asking for typical retail concessions, such as promotional and markdown allowances. The purchasing department utilizes several buying techniques that enables us to offer to consumers branded and other merchandise at everyday low prices. The majority of the nationally recognized branded products we sell are purchased in-season and represent vendors excess inventories resulting from production or retailer order cancellations. We generally purchase later in the merchandising buying cycle than department and specialty stores. This allows us to take advantage of imbalances between retailers demands for specific merchandise and manufacturers supply of that merchandise. We also purchase merchandise from some vendors in advance of the selling season at reduced prices. Occasionally, we purchase merchandise on an opportunistic basis, which we then store as pack and hold for sale three to nine months later. Where possible, we seek to purchase items based on style or color in limited quantities on a test basis with the right to reorder as needed. Finally, we purchase private label merchandise that we source to our specifications. We allocate merchandise across our store base according to store-level demand. The merchandising staff utilizes a centralized management system to monitor merchandise purchasing, allocation and sales in order to maximize inventory turnover, identify and respond to changing product demands and determine the timing of mark-downs to our merchandise. The buyers also regularly review the age and condition of the merchandise and manage both the reordering and clearance processes. In addition, the merchandising team communicates with regional, district and store managers to ascertain regional and store-level conditions and to better ensure that our product mix meets our consumers demands in terms of quality, fashion, price and availability. We accept payment from our customers for merchandise at time of sale. Payments are made to us by cash, check, VisaTM or MastercardTM. We do not extend credit terms to our customers. Seasonality The nature of our business is seasonal. Historically, sales in the first and fourth quarters have been higher than sales achieved in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year. Expenses, and to a greater extent operating income, vary by quarter. Results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year. Furthermore, the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods. Store Operations Store Format. Our existing 235 stores average selling space is approximately 9,000 square feet, which allows us the space and flexibility to departmentalize our stores and provide directed traffic patterns. New stores opened since the beginning of fiscal 2003 average approximately 10,500 square feet of selling space, which is larger than our historical store base. As a result of these new stores, as well as due to the remodeling and expansion of existing stores, the average square footage of selling space per store has increased from approximately 7,600 at the end of fiscal 2002 to its current level. We arrange our stores in a racetrack format with womens sportswear, our most attractive and fashion current merchandise, in the center of each store and complementary categories adjacent to those items. Mens and boys apparel is displayed on one side of the store, while dresses, footwear and accessories are displayed on the other side. Merchandise for infants, toddlers and girls is displayed along the back of the store. Impulse items, such as jewelry and sunglasses, are featured near the checkout area. Products from 5 nationally recognized brands are prominently displayed on four-way racks at the front of each department. The remaining merchandise is displayed on hanging racks and occasionally on table displays. Large hanging signs identify each category location. The unobstructed floor plan allows the customer to see virtually all of the different product areas from the store entrance and provides us the flexibility to easily expand and contract departments in response to consumer demand, seasonality and merchandise availability. Virtually all of our inventory is displayed on the selling floor. Prices are clearly marked and often have the comparative retail-selling price noted on the price tag. Store Management. Store operations are managed by our Vice President of Store Operations, three regional managers and 26 district managers, each of whom typically manages eight to ten stores. The typical store is staffed with a store manager, two or three assistant managers and seven to eight part-time sales associates, all of whom rotate work days on a shift basis. District managers and store managers participate in a bonus program based on achieving predetermined levels of sales and profits. The district managers also participate in bonus programs based on achieving targeted payroll costs. Regional managers participate in a bonus program based on a rollup of the district managers bonuses. The assistant managers and sales associates are compensated on an hourly basis with incentives. Moreover, we recognize individual performance through internal promotions and provide extensive opportunities for advancement, particularly given our rapid growth. We place significant emphasis on loss prevention in order to control inventory shrinkage. Initiatives include electronic tags on all of our products, training and education of store personnel on loss prevention issues, digital video camera systems, alarm systems and motion detectors in the stores. We also capture extensive point-of-sale data and maintain systems that monitor returns, voids and employee sales, and produce trend and exception reports to assist in identifying shrinkage issues. We have a centralized loss prevention team that focuses exclusively on implementation of these initiatives and specifically on stores that have experienced above average levels of shrinkage. We also maintain a 1-800 Tips line for reporting shrinkage concerns. Employee Training. Our employees are critical to achieving our goals, and we strive to hire employees with high energy levels and motivation. We have well-established store operating policies and procedures and an extensive 90-day in-store training program for new store managers and assistant managers. Sales associates also participate in a 30-day customer service and store procedures training program, which are designed to enable them to assist customers in a friendly, helpful manner. Layaway Program. We offer a layaway program that allows customers to purchase merchandise by initially paying a 20% deposit together with a $2.00 service charge. The customer then makes additional payments every two weeks and has 60 days within which to complete the purchase. If the purchase is not completed, the customer receives a merchandise credit for amounts paid less a $5.00 re-stocking fee and service charge. Sales under the layaway program accounted for approximately 12% of our total sales in fiscal 2005. Site Selection. Cost-effective store locations are an important part of our profitability model. Accordingly, we look for second and third use store locations that offer attractive rents, but also meet our demographic and economic criteria. We have a dedicated real estate management team responsible for new store site selection. In selecting a location, we target both urban and rural markets. Demographic criteria used in site selection include concentrations of its core consumers. In addition, we require convenient site accessibility, as well as strong co-tenants, such as food stores, dollar stores, rent-to-own stores and other apparel stores. Shortly after we sign a new store lease, our store construction department prepares the store by installing fixtures, signs, dressing rooms, checkout counters, cash register systems and other items. Once we take possession of a store site, we can open the store within approximately three to four weeks. Advertising and Marketing Our advertising goal is to build the Citi Trends brand and promote consumers association of the Citi Trends brand with value, quality, fashion and everyday low prices. We generally focus our advertising efforts during the Easter, back-to-school and Christmas seasons. This advertising consists of radio commercials on local hip-hop radio stations that highlight our brands, value and everyday low prices. We also do in-store advertising that includes window signs designated for special purposes, such as seasonal events and clearance periods, and taped audio advertisements co-mingled with in-store music programs. Signs change in color, quantity and theme every three to six weeks. For store grand openings, we typically seek to create community awareness and consumer excitement through radio advertising preceding and during the grand opening and by creating an on-site event with local radio personalities broadcasting from the new location. We also distribute promotional items such as gift certificates and shopping sprees in connection with our grand openings. Our marketing efforts center on promoting our everyday low prices and on demonstrating the strong price-to-value relationship of our products to our consumers. We do not utilize promotional advertising. Merchandise is priced so that our competition rarely has lower prices. In the limited situations where the competition offers the same merchandise at a lower price, we will match the price. 6 Distribution All merchandise sold in our stores is shipped directly from our distribution centers in Savannah and our distribution center in Darlington, South Carolina. In October 2005, we purchased the Darlington facility, which is situated on 90 acres of land. As of January 28, 2006, we have paid approximately $2.4 million of the approximately $4.0 million expected to be spent on acquisition costs and for capital improvements necessary to prepare the location for full operation. The Darlington facility began receiving and processing shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. We are continuing the physical renovation and updating of this distribution center, which has the same technology and information systems as our other distribution centers. We generally ship merchandise from our Fahm Street distribution center to our stores daily and ship merchandise twice a week from our Darlington distribution center. We utilize United Parcel Service, Inc. and FedEx Corporation to ship merchandise to our stores. The two distribution centers in Savannah have a combined square footage of approximately 240,000, including approximately 20,000 square feet of office space. The Darlington facility has approximately 286,500 square feet. We expect our distribution facilities to provide us the capacity to double our existing sales volume. Information Technology and Systems We have information systems in place to support each of our business functions. We purchased our enterprise software from Island Pacific, a primary software provider to the retail industry. The computer platform is an IBM AS400. The Island Pacific software supports the following business functions: purchasing, purchase order management, price and markdown management, distribution, merchandise allocation, general ledger, accounts payable and sales audit. Our stores use point-of-sale software from DataVantage, a division of MICROS Systems, Inc., to run the stores cash registers. The system uses bar code scanners at checkout to capture item sales. It also supports end-of-day processing and automatically transmits sales and transaction data to Savannah soon after the close of business. Additionally, the software supports store time clock and payroll functions. To facilitate the marking down and re-ticketing of merchandise, employees in the stores use hand-held scanners that read the correct item price and prepare new price tickets for merchandise. DataVantage software also enables us to sort and review transaction data and generate exception and other database reporting to assist in loss prevention. We believe that our information systems, with upgrades and updates over time, are adequate to support our operations for the foreseeable future. Growth Strategy Our growth strategy is to open stores in new and existing markets, as well as to increase sales in existing stores. Adding stores in the markets we currently serve often enables us to benefit from enhanced name recognition and achieves advertising and operating synergies. In fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004, we opened 25 and 40 stores, respectively, and entered the Baltimore, Maryland, Houston, Texas, Norfolk, Virginia and Washington, D.C. markets. In fiscal 2005, we opened 36 new stores, and entered the Cincinnati, Ohio, Dallas, Texas, Louisville, Kentucky and Miami, Florida markets. We expect to open 42 to 45 new stores in fiscal 2006. Approximately 90% of the new stores we intend to open in fiscal 2006 will be located in states we currently serve. We intend to increase comparable store sales by increasing the assortment and amount of inventory in existing merchandise categories for which recent sales and/or sales trends are encouraging. We also intend to increase comparable store sales through the expansion of adjacent product categories such as home décor and intimate apparel. Competition The markets we serve are highly competitive. The principal methods of competition in the retail business are fashion, assortment, pricing and presentation. We believe we have a competitive advantage in our offering of fashionable brands at everyday low prices. We compete against a diverse group of retailers including national off-price retailers, mass merchants, smaller specialty retailers and dollar stores. The off-price retail companies with which we compete include The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX Companies), Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corp. (Burlington Coat Factory) and Ross Stores, Inc. (Ross Stores). In particular, TJX Companies A.J. Wright stores target moderate income consumers. Ross Stores has recently launched a similar concept targeting lower income consumers, called dds DISCOUNTS. We believe our strategy of appealing to African-American consumers and offering urban apparel products allows us to compete successfully with these retailers. We also believe we offer a more inviting store format than the off-price retailers, including our use of carpeted floors and more prominently displayed brands. We also compete with a group of smaller specialty retailers that only sell womens products, such as Rainbow, Dots, Fashion Cents, Its Fashions! and 7 Simply Fashions. Our mass merchant competitors include Wal-Mart and Kmart. These chains do not focus on fashion apparel and, within their apparel offering, lack the urban focus that we believe differentiates our offering and appeals to our core customers. Similarly, while some of the dollar store chains offer apparel, they typically offer a more limited selection focused on basic apparel needs. As a result, we believe there is significant demand for a value retailer that addresses the market of low- to moderate-income consumers generally and, particularly, African-American and other minority consumers who seek value-priced, urban fashion apparel and accessories. Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks and service marks as having significant value and as being important to our marketing efforts. We have registered the Citi Trends trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register as both a trademark for retail department store services and as a trademark for clothing. We have also registered the following trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register: Citi Club, Citi Express, Citi Knights, Citi Nite, Citi Steps, Citi Trends Fashion for Less, Citi Women, CT Sport, Diva Blue, Lil Citi Man, Lil Ms Hollywood, Univer Soul, Urban Sophistication and Vintage Harlem. Our policy is to pursue registration of its marks and to oppose vigorously infringement of its marks. Employees As of March 31, 2006, we had approximately 1,300 full-time and approximately 1,500 part-time employees. Of these employees, approximately 2,300 are employed in our stores and the remainder are employed in our distribution centers and corporate offices. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements, and none of our employees is represented by a labor union. We believe our relations with our employees are good. 8 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following information, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be considered carefully before a decision is made whether to buy our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends on our ability to anticipate, identify and respond rapidly to changes in consumers fashion tastes, and our failure to evaluate adequately fashion trends could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The apparel industry in general and our core customer market in particular are subject to rapidly evolving fashion trends and shifting consumer demands. Accordingly, our success is heavily dependent on our ability to anticipate, identify and capitalize on emerging fashion trends, including products, styles and materials that will appeal to our target consumers. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in styles, trends, brand preferences or desired image preferences is likely to lead to lower demand for our merchandise, which could cause, among other things, sales declines, excess inventories and higher markdowns. The inaccuracy of our forecasts regarding fashion trends could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unsuccessful in competing with our retail apparel competitors, our market share could decline or our growth could be impaired and, as a result, our financial results could suffer. The retail apparel market is highly competitive, with few barriers to entry. We compete against a diverse group of retailers, including national off-price apparel chains such as the TJX Companies, Burlington Coat Factory and Ross Stores; mass merchants such as Wal-Mart and Kmart; smaller discount retail chains that only sell womens products, such as Rainbow, DotsTM, Fashion CentsTM, Its Fashions! (a subsidiary of The Cato Corporation) and Simply Fashions; and general merchandise discount stores and dollar stores, which offer a variety of products, including apparel, for the value-conscious consumer. We also compete against local off-price and specialty retail stores, regional retail chains, traditional department stores and web-based retail stores and other direct retailers. The level of competition we face from these retailers varies depending on the product segment, as many of our competitors do not offer apparel for the entire family. Our greatest competition is generally in womens apparel. Many of our competitors are larger than us and have substantially greater resources than us and, as a result, may be able to adapt better to changing market conditions, exploit new opportunities, exert greater pricing pressures on suppliers and open new stores more quickly and effectively than the us. Many of these retailers have better name recognition among consumers than us and purchase significantly more merchandise from vendors. These retailers may be able to purchase branded merchandise that we cannot purchase because of their name recognition and relationships with suppliers, or they may be able to purchase branded merchandise with better pricing concessions than us. Our local and regional competitors have extensive knowledge of the consumer base and may be able to garner more loyalty from customers than us. If the consumer base we serve is satisfied with the selection, quality and price of the competitors products, consumers may decide not to shop in our stores. Additionally, if our existing competitors or other retailers decide to focus more on our core customers, particularly African-Americans consumers, we may have greater difficulty in competing effectively, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could suffer. The retail industry periodically has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes. In the future, other United States or foreign retailers may consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, or realign their affiliations. Any of these developments could result in our competitors increasing their buying power or market visibility. These developments may cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse effect on our sales, revenues and results of operations. We could experience a reduction in sales and revenues or reduced cash flows if we are unable to fulfill our current and future merchandising needs. We depend on our suppliers for the continued availability and satisfactory quality of our merchandise. Most of our suppliers could discontinue selling to us at any time. Additionally, if the manufacturers or other owners of brands or trademarks terminate the license agreements under which some of our suppliers sell our products, we may be unable to obtain replacement merchandise of comparable fashion appeal or quality, in the same quantities or at the same prices. If we lose the services of one or more of our significant suppliers or one or more of them fail to meet our merchandising needs, we may be unable to obtain replacement merchandise in a timely manner. If our existing suppliers cannot meet its increased needs and we cannot locate alternative supply sources, we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of the most popular items of the nationally recognized brands at attractive prices, which could negatively impact our sales, revenues and results of operations. 9 As an apparel retailer, we rely on numerous third parties in the supply chain to produce and deliver the products that we sell, and our business may be negatively impacted by failure to comply with applicable law. As an importer and retailer of goods, we rely on numerous third parties to supply the products we sell. Violations of law by our importers, buying agents, manufacturers or distributors could result in delays in shipments and receipt of goods and could subject us to fines or other penalties, any of which could restrict our business activities, increase our operating expenses or cause our revenues to decline. Further, we are susceptible to the receipt of counterfeit brands or unlicensed goods. We could incur liability with manufacturers or other owners of the brands or trademarked products if we inadvertently receive and sell counterfeit brands or unlicensed goods and, therefore, it is important that we establish relationships with reputable vendors to prevent the possibility that we inadvertently receive counterfeit brands or unlicensed goods. Although we have a quality assurance team to check merchandise in an effort to assure that we purchase only authentic brands and licensed goods and are careful in selecting our vendors, we may receive products that we are prohibited from selling or incur liability for selling counterfeit brands or unlicensed goods, which could increase our operating expenses and cause our net income to decline. If our growth strategy is unsuccessful, our financial condition and results of operation could suffer and the market price of our common stock could decline. Our ability to continue to increase our net sales and earnings depends, in large part, on opening new stores and operating the new and existing stores profitably. We opened 40 and 36 new stores in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005, respectively. We expect to open 42 to 45 new stores in fiscal 2006. If we are unable to open all of these stores or operate them profitability, we may not achieve our forecasted sales and earnings growth targets. Additionally, growth of our store base will place increased demands on our operating, managerial and administrative resources and may lead to management and operating inefficiencies, including merchandising, personnel, distribution and integration problems. These demands and inefficiencies may cause deterioration in the financial performance of our individual stores and, therefore, our entire business. A significant disruption to our distribution process or southeastern retail locations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to distribute our merchandise to our store locations in a timely manner is essential to the efficient and profitable operation of our business. We have two distribution centers located in Savannah, one of which also serves as our corporate headquarters, and we recently acquired a distribution center in Darlington. Together, these facilities provide distribution capacity to support twice our current sales volume. Any natural disaster or other disruption to the operation of any of these facilities due to fire, hurricane, other natural disaster or any other cause or our inability to continue the timely and efficient build out of our Darlington distribution center could damage a significant portion of our inventory or impair our ability to stock our stores and process product returns to suppliers adequately. In addition, the southeastern United States, where all three of our distribution centers are located, is vulnerable to significant damage or destruction from hurricanes and tropical storms. Although we maintain insurance on our stores and other facilities, the economic effects of a natural disaster that affects our distribution centers and/or a significant number of our stores could increase our operating expenses, impair our cash flows and reduce our revenues, which could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. Our sales in the Gulf Coast Region depend on the Region recovering from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, which caused damage to areas of the Gulf Coast region of the United States during the period of August 2005 to October 2005, impacted our stores in Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. Thirty-eight of our stores were closed for one or more days due to the hurricanes. One existing store was permanently closed as of January 28, 2006 and another has not reopened as of March 31, 2006. Following Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, we experienced an increase in sales in our store locations in the markets directly affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and in contiguous markets. We believe that these sales increases resulted directly from aid distributed to our customers and the need for our customers to replace lost or damaged clothing and other items. These sales increases have begun to dissipate, and we anticipate that the magnitude of these increases will continue to diminish over time and that we will not continue to increase or maintain our sales at the levels achieved in the months of September 2005 through January 2006. The future contribution of stores affected by the hurricanes to our results of operations will depend on the recovery of the local economy generally in the hurricane-impacted areas of the Gulf Coast region. A natural disaster producing the level of devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina is unprecedented in recent United States history and the recovery of the local economies and impacted industries in the affected regions will to a certain extent depend on the leadership and actions of federal, state and local governments, which are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance as to the timing and ultimate success of recovery efforts led by federal, state and local governments. In addition, the long-term impact of the hurricanes, such as lack of housing, unemployment or increases 10 in gasoline prices, may disproportionately affect many of our customers in the Gulf Coast region. Our net sales, inventory levels and earnings fluctuate on a seasonal basis, which makes our business more susceptible to adverse events that occur during those seasons. Our net sales and earnings are disproportionately higher during the first and fourth quarters each year due to the importance of the spring selling season, which includes Easter, and the fall selling season, which includes Christmas. Factors negatively affecting us during the first and fourth quarters, including adverse weather and unfavorable economic conditions, will have a greater adverse effect on our financial condition than if the business were less seasonal. In order to prepare for the spring and fall selling seasons, we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than during other parts of the year. This seasonality makes our business more susceptible to the risk that our inventory will not satisfy actual consumer demand. Any unanticipated demand imbalances during these peak shopping seasons could require us to either sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown or fail to satisfy consumers. In either event, our net sales and gross margins may be lower than historical levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. We are in the process of documenting and testing our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in fiscal 2006. Section 404 requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments. During the course of our testing, we may identify deficiencies in our internal controls, which we may be unable to correct in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may be unable to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our stock could decline significantly and we may be unable to obtain additional financing to operate and expand its business. We depend on the experience and expertise of our senior management team and key employees, and accordingly, the loss of the services of R. Edward Anderson or George A. Bellino could have a material adverse effect on our business strategy, operating costs, financial condition and results of operations. The success of our business is dependent upon the close supervision of all aspects of the business by senior management, particularly the operation of our stores, the selection of merchandise and the site selection for new stores. In addition, we do not have a non-competition agreement with R. Edward Anderson, the Chief Executive Officer, and our non-competition agreement with George A. Bellino, the President and Chief Merchandising Officer, will expire on December 31, 2006. Accordingly, Messrs. Anderson and/or Bellino could leave us and begin to work for our competitors, which loss of services could have a material adverse effect on our business strategy, operating costs, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to attract, train, assimilate and retain skilled personnel could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and financial condition. Like most retailers, we experience significant employee turnover rates, particularly among store sales associates and managers, and our continued growth will require us to hire and train even more new personnel. We therefore must continually attract, hire and train new personnel to meet our staffing needs. We constantly compete for qualified personnel with companies in our industry and in other industries. A significant increase in the turnover rate among our store sales associates and managers would increase our recruiting and training costs and could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity. If we are unable to retain our employees or attract, train, assimilate or retain other skilled personnel in the future, we may not be able to service our customers as effectively, thus reducing our ability to continue our growth and to operate our existing stores as profitably as they have been in the past. Legal proceedings to which we are a party result in an adverse judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are from time to time involved in various legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business. Such claims may be made by our customers, employees or former employees and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. We are not party to any material litigation or legal proceedings, or to the best of our knowledge, subject to any legal proceedings pending or threatened against us that we expect to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition 11 and results of operations. Any failure of management information systems or the inability of third parties to continue to upgrade and maintain our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on the accuracy, reliability and proper functioning of our management information systems, including the systems used to track our sales and facilitate inventory management. We also rely on our management information systems for merchandise planning, replenishment and markdowns, as well as other key business functions. These functions enhance our ability to optimize sales while limiting markdowns and reducing inventory risk through properly marking down slow-selling styles, reordering existing styles and effectively distributing new inventory to our stores. We do not currently have redundant systems for all functions performed by our management information systems. Any interruption in these systems could impair our ability to manage our inventory effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To support our growth, we will need to expand our management information systems, and our failure to link and maintain these systems adequately could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on third-party suppliers to maintain and periodically upgrade our management information systems, including the software programs supporting our inventory management functions. This software is licensed to us by third-party suppliers. If any of these suppliers is unable to continue to maintain and upgrade these software programs and/or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, it could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to attract consumers to our stores depends on the success of the strip shopping centers and downtown business districts where our stores are located. We locate our stores in strip shopping centers, street front locations and downtown business districts where we believe our consumers and potential consumers shop. The success of an individual store can depend on favorable placement within a given strip shopping center or business district. We cannot control the development of alternative shopping destinations near existing stores or the availability or cost of real estate within existing or new shopping destinations. If store locations fail to attract sufficient consumer traffic or we are unable to locate replacement locations on terms acceptable to us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. If one or more of the anchor tenants located in the strip shopping centers or business districts where our stores are located close or leave, or if there is significant deterioration of the surrounding areas in which our stores are located, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
