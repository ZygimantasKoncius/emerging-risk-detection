Item 1A. Risk Factors PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 SAFE HARBOR CAUTIONARY STATEMENT This Annual Report on Form 10-K (Form 10-K), including exhibits, contains statements that are not based on historical fact and represent forward-looking statements, as this term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities, events or developments that TDS intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. The words believes, anticipates, estimates, expects, plans, intends and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying them. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, events or developments to be significantly different from any future results, events or developments expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include those set forth below under Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. However, the factors described under Risk Factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in this document. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on future results, performance or achievements. TDS undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Form 10-K to understand the material risks relating to TDSs business. RISK FACTORS Intense competition in the markets in which TDS operates could adversely affect TDSs revenues or increase its costs to compete. Competition in the telecommunications industry is intense. TDSs ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on its ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the telecommunications industry. TDS anticipates that competition will cause the prices for products and services to continue to decline, and the costs to compete to increase, in the future. Some of TDSs competitors are national or global telecommunications companies that are larger than TDS, possess greater resources, possess more extensive coverage areas and more spectrum within their coverage areas, and may market other services with their communications services that TDS does not offer. In addition, TDS may face competition from technologies that may be introduced in the future or from new entrants into the industry. There can be no assurance that TDS will be able to compete successfully in this environment or that new technologies and products that are more commercially effective than the technologies and products utilized by TDS will not be developed. Sources of competition to TDSs wireless business typically include three to five competing wireless telecommunications service providers in each market, wireline telecommunications service providers, resellers (including mobile virtual network operators) and providers of other alternate telecommunications services. Many of TDSs wireless competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, purchasing and distribution resources than TDS. Sources of competition to TDSs wireline incumbent local exchange carrier business include, but are not limited to, resellers of local exchange services, interexchange carriers, satellite transmission service providers, wireless communications providers, cable television companies, competitive access service providers, competitive local exchange carriers, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) providers and providers using other emerging technologies. In the future, TDS expects the number of 57 its wireline physical access lines served to continue to be adversely affected by wireless and broadband substitution. Sources of competition to TDSs wireline competitive local exchange carrier business include the sources identified in the prior paragraph as well as the incumbent local exchange carrier in each market, which enjoys competitive advantages, including its wireline connection to virtually all of the customers and potential customers of TDSs competitive local exchange carrier, its established brand name and its substantial financial resources. TDSs competitive local exchange carrier is required to discount services to win potential customers. These factors result in lower operating margins for TDSs competitive local exchange carrier, and make it vulnerable to any discount pricing policies that the incumbent local exchange carrier may adopt to exploit its lower-cost structure and greater financial resources. These factors are not in TDSs control. Changes in such competitive factors could result in product, pricing or cost disadvantages and could have an adverse effect on TDSs business, financial condition or results of operations. Consolidation in the telecommunications industry could adversely affect TDSs revenues and increase its costs of doing business. There has been a recent trend in the telecommunications and related industries towards consolidation of service providers through joint ventures, reorganizations and acquisitions. TDS expects this trend towards consolidation to continue, leading to larger competitors over time. TDS may be unable to compete successfully with larger companies that have substantially greater financial, marketing or technical resources or that offer more services than TDS, which could adversely affect TDSs revenues and costs of doing business. In addition, consolidation of long distance carriers could result in TDS having to pay more for long distance services which could increase TDSs costs of doing business. Advances or changes in telecommunications technology, such as Voice over Internet Protocol or WiMAX, could render certain technologies used by TDS obsolete, could reduce TDSs revenues or could increase its costs of doing business. The telecommunications industry is experiencing significant technological change, as evidenced by evolving industry standards, ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter development cycles for new products and enhancements and changes in end-user requirements and preferences. Technological advances and industry changes, such as the implementation by other carriers of third generation (3G) technology or wideband technologies such as WiFi and WiMAX which do not rely on FCC-licensed spectrum, could cause the technology used on TDSs wireless networks to become obsolete. In addition, Voice over Internet Protocol, also known as VoIP, is an emerging technological trend that could cause a decrease in demand for TDSs telephone services. TDS may not be able to respond to such changes and implement new technology on a timely or cost-effective basis, which could reduce its revenues or increase its costs of doing business. If TDS cannot keep pace with these technological changes or other changes in the telecommunications industry over time, its financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business could be adversely affected. Changes in the regulatory environment or a failure by TDS to timely or fully comply with any regulatory requirements could adversely affect TDSs financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business. TDSs operations are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the FCC, state public utility commissions and other federal, and state and local regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. Adverse decisions or increased regulation by these regulatory bodies could negatively impact TDSs operations by, among other things, increasing TDSs costs of doing business, permitting greater competition or limiting TDSs ability to engage in certain sales or marketing activities. 58 TDSs wireless business requires licenses granted by the FCC to provide wireless telecommunications services. Typically, such licenses are issued for initial 10-year terms and may be renewed for additional 10-year terms subject to FCC approval of the renewal applications. Failure to comply with FCC requirements in a given service area could result in the revocation of TDSs license for that area or in the imposition of fines. Court decisions and rulemakings could have a substantial impact on TDSs wireless operations, including in particular rulemakings on intercarrier access compensation and universal service. Litigation and different objectives among federal and state regulators could create uncertainty and delay TDSs ability to respond to new regulations. TDS is unable to predict the future actions of the various regulatory bodies that govern TDS, but such actions could have a material adverse effect on TDSs wireless business. TDSs incumbent local exchange carriers have been granted permission to operate by each of the states in which TDS operates. TDS is subject to regulation from the regulatory commissions in each of these states as well as from the FCC. State regulatory commissions have primary jurisdiction over local and intrastate rates that TDS charges customers, including, without limitation, other telecommunications companies, and service quality standards. The FCC has primary jurisdiction over the interstate access rates that TDS charges other telecommunications companies that use TDSs network and issues related to interstate service. TDS receives a substantial amount of its incumbent local exchange carrier revenue from other interexchange carriers for providing access to its network and compensation from the Universal Service Fund and other support funds. The FCC is re-examining all currently regulated forms of access charges and the prospect for continued access charges is uncertain. Furthermore, the FCC is reviewing the Universal Service Fund and applicable rules to assess the sustainability of the fund and is examining the process for determining the appropriate contributors, contribution rate, collection method, supported services, and the eligibility and portability of payments. Changes in access charges and the Universal Service Fund that reduce the size of the fund and payments to TDS could have a material adverse impact on this source of revenues. Future revenues, costs, and capital investment in TDSs wireline business could be adversely affected by material changes to these regulations including but not limited to changes in intercarrier compensation, state and federal universal service support, unbundled network element platform or UNE-P pricing and requirements, and VoIP regulation. Although TDSs competitive local exchange carriers do not have regulatory review in the same way as the ILECs, the viability of their business model depends on FCC and state regulations. Court decisions and regulatory developments relating to UNE-P and access and transport options could negatively affect the competitive local exchange carriers ability to obtain access to certain local networks or provide broadband services to end users and/or increase the cost of providing some services. As a result of certain recent court decisions and regulatory developments, TDS is phasing-out competitive local exchange carrier operations that rely on an unbundled network element platform (UNE-P) provided by incumbent carriers. Moreover, the loss of some access and transport options as a result of such developments is unfavorable for TDSs competitive local exchange carrier operations and could negatively affect their ability to provide broadband services to end users. TDS attempts to timely and fully comply with all regulatory requirements. However, in certain circumstances, TDS may not be able to timely or fully comply with all regulatory requirements due to various factors, including changes to regulatory requirements, limitations in or availability of technology, insufficient time provided for compliance, problems encountered in attempting to comply or other factors. For instance, TDS is not in compliance with the revised phase two enhanced 911 requirements in some of its markets. Although TDS has requested a waiver from the FCC with respect thereto, there is no guarantee that TDS will not be subject to sanctions, including monetary forfeitures, for failure to comply with the FCCs enhanced 911 requirements in its markets. Any failure by TDS to timely or fully comply with any regulatory requirements could adversely affect TDSs financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business. 59 Changes in TDSs enterprise value, changes in the supply or demand of the market for wireless licenses or telephone company franchises, adverse developments in the business or the industry in which TDS is involved and/or other factors could require TDS to recognize impairments in the carrying value of TDSs license costs, goodwill and/or physical assets. A large portion of TDSs assets consists of intangible assets in the form of licenses and goodwill. TDS also has substantial investments in long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment. Licenses, goodwill and other long-lived assets must be reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. TDS reviews its licenses, goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss may need to be recognized to the extent the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of such assets. The amount of any such impairment charges could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on TDSs reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken. The estimation of fair values requires assumptions by management about factors that are highly uncertain including future cash flows, the appropriate discount rate, and other factors. Different assumptions for these factors or valuation methodologies could create materially different results. Early redemptions of debt or repurchases of debt, issuances of debt, changes in prepaid forward contracts, changes in operating leases, changes in purchase obligations or other factors or developments could cause the amounts reported under Contractual Obligations in TDSs Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to be different from the amounts actually incurred. TDS has reported amounts with respect to future contractual obligations under the caption Contractual Obligations in its Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Form 10-K. The actual amounts disbursed in the future may differ materially from these currently reported amounts due to various factors, including early redemptions of debt or repurchases of debt, issuances of debt, changes in prepaid forward contracts, changes in operating leases, changes in purchase obligations or other factors or developments. Changes in accounting standards or TDSs accounting policies, estimates and/or in the assumptions underlying the accounting estimates, including those described under TDSs Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, could have an adverse effect on TDSs financial condition or results of operations. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions. TDS has described certain critical accounting policies and estimates under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in its Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Form 10-K. Changes in accounting standards or TDSs accounting policies, estimates and/or in the assumptions underlying the accounting estimates could have an adverse effect on TDSs financial condition and results of operations. Settlements, judgments, restraints on its current or future manner of doing business and/or legal costs resulting from pending and future litigation could have an adverse effect on TDSs financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business. TDS is regularly involved in a number of legal proceedings before the FCC and various state and federal courts. Such legal proceedings can be complex, costly, protracted and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel. 60 The assessment of legal proceedings is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events. The amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or other resolution of litigation and other contingencies may differ materially from amounts accrued in the financial statements. In addition, litigation or similar proceedings could impose restraints on TDSs current or future manner of doing business and/or could have an adverse effect on TDSs financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business Costs, integration problems or other factors associated with acquisitions/divestitures of properties and/or licenses and/or expansion of TDSs business could have an adverse effect on TDSs business, financial condition or results of operations. As part of TDSs operating strategy, TDS may expand the markets in which it operates through the acquisition of other telecommunications service providers, the acquisition of selected licenses or operating markets from such providers or through direct investment. The acquisition of additional businesses will depend on TDSs ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to negotiate acceptable terms for their acquisition and to finance any such acquisitions. TDS will also be subject to competition for suitable acquisition candidates. Any acquisitions, if made, could divert the resources and management time of TDS and would require integration with TDSs existing business operations and services. As a result, there can be no assurance that any such acquisitions will occur or that any such acquisitions, if made, would be made in a timely manner or on terms favorable to TDS or would be successfully integrated into TDSs operations. These transactions commonly involve a number of risks, including: · entering markets in which TDS has limited or no direct prior experience and competitors have stronger positions; · uncertain revenues and expenses, with the result that TDS may not realize the growth in revenues, anticipated cost structure, profitability, or return on investment that it expects; · difficulty of integrating the technologies, products, operations and personnel of the acquired businesses; · diversion of managements attention; · disruption of ongoing business; · impact on TDSs cash and available credit lines for use in financing future growth and working capital needs; · inability to retain key personnel; · inability to successfully incorporate acquired assets and rights into TDSs service offerings; · inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and · impairment of relationships with employees, customers or vendors. Failure to overcome these risks or any other problems encountered in these transactions could have a material adverse effect on TDSs business, financial condition or results of operations. If TDS expands into new telecommunications businesses or markets, it may incur significant expenditures, a substantial portion of which must be made before any revenues will be realized. Such expenditures may increase as a result of the accelerated pace of regulatory and technological changes. Such expenditures, together with the associated high initial service costs of providing service in new markets, may result in reduced cash flow until an adequate revenue base is established. There can be no assurance that an adequate revenue base will be established in any new technology or market which TDS pursues. If TDS expands into new telecommunications businesses or markets, it will incur certain additional risks in connection with such expansion, including increased legal and regulatory risks, and possible adverse reaction by some of its current customers. Such telecommunications businesses 61 and markets are highly competitive and, as a new entrant, TDS may be disadvantaged. The success of TDSs entry into new telecommunications businesses or markets will be dependent upon, among other things, TDSs ability to select new equipment and software and to integrate the new equipment and software into its operations, to hire and train qualified personnel and to enhance its billing, back-office and information systems to accommodate the new businesses or markets. No assurance can be given that TDS will be successful with respect to these efforts. If TDS is not successful with respect to its expansion initiatives, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Changes in various business factors could have an adverse effect on TDSs business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes in any of several factors could reduce TDSs revenue growth and profitability. These factors include, but are not limited to: · demand for or usage of services, · the pricing of services, · the overall size and growth rate of TDSs customer base, · average revenue per unit, · penetration rates, · churn rates, · selling expenses, · net customer acquisition and retention costs, · roaming rates, · minutes of use, · the mix of products and services offered by TDS and purchased by customers, and · the costs of providing products and services. Any changes in such factors could have an adverse effect on TDSs business, financial or results of operations. A significant portion of TDSs wireless revenues is derived from customers who buy services through independent agents and dealers who market TDSs services on a commission basis. If TDSs relationships with these agents and dealers are seriously harmed, its wireless revenues could be adversely affected. TDS has relationships with agents, dealers and other third-party retailers to obtain customers. Agents and dealers are independent business people who obtain customers for TDS on a commission basis. TDSs agents are generally in the business of selling wireless telephones, wireless service packages and other related products. TDSs dealers include major appliance dealers, car stereo companies and mass merchants including regional and national companies. Additionally, in support of its overall Internet initiatives, TDS has recruited agents who provide services exclusively through the Internet. TDSs business and growth depends, in part, on the maintenance of satisfactory relationships with its agents, dealers and other third-party retailers. If such relationships are seriously harmed, TDSs revenues and, as a result, its financial condition or results of operations, could be adversely affected. 62 TDSs investments in technologies which are unproven or for which success has not yet been demonstrated may not produce the benefits that TDS expects. TDS is making investments in various new technologies and product offerings. These investments have included technologies for enhanced data services offerings. TDS expects new products and solutions based on these new technologies to contribute to future growth in its revenues. However, the markets for some of these products and solutions are still emerging and the overall potential for these markets remains uncertain and unproven. If customer demand for these new products and solutions does not develop as expected, TDSs financial conditions or results of operations could be adversely affected. An inability to obtain or maintain roaming arrangements with other carriers on terms that are acceptable to TDS, and/or changes in roaming rates and the lack of standards and roaming agreements for wireless data products, could have an adverse effect on TDSs business, financial condition or results of operations. TDSs customers can access another carriers analog cellular or digital system automatically only if the other carrier allows TDSs customers to roam on its network. TDS relies on roaming agreements with other carriers to provide roaming capability to its customers in areas of the U.S. outside its service areas and to improve coverage within selected areas of TDSs network footprint. Though TDS has a long-term agreement with it key roaming partner, in general these agreements are subject to renewal and termination if certain events occur, including, without limitation, if network standards are not maintained. Some competitors may be able to obtain lower roaming rates than TDS because they have larger call volumes or because of their affiliations with, or ownership of, wireless carriers, or may be able to reduce roaming charges by providing service principally over their own network. In addition, the quality of service that a wireless carrier delivers during a roaming call may be inferior to the quality of service TDS provides, the price of a roaming call may not be competitive with prices of other wireless carriers for such call, and TDSs customers may not be able to use some of the advanced features, such as voicemail notification, or data applications that the customers enjoy when making calls within TDSs network. In addition, TDSs wireless CDMA and CDMA 1XRTT technology is not compatible with certain other technologies used by certain other carriers, such as GSM and GPRS, limiting the ability of TDS to enter into roaming agreements with such other carriers. TDSs roaming partners could switch their business to new operators, or over time, to their own networks. Changes in roaming usage patterns, rates per roaming minute of use and relationships with carriers whose customers generate roaming minutes of use on TDSs network all could have an adverse effect on TDSs revenues and revenue growth. If TDS is unable to obtain or maintain roaming agreements with other wireless carriers that contain pricing and other terms that are competitive and acceptable to TDS, and that satisfy TDSs quality and interoperability requirements, its business, financial conditions or results of operations could be adversely affected. Changes in access to content for data or video services and access to new handsets being developed by vendors, or an inability to manage its supply chain or inventory successfully, could have an adverse effect on TDSs business, financial condition or results of operations. TDSs businesses may increasingly depend on its access to content for data or video services and access to new handsets being developed by vendors. TDSs ability to obtain such access depends in part on other parties. If TDS is unable to obtain access to content for data or video services or prompt access to new handsets being developed by vendors, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Operation of TDSs supply chain and management of its inventory balances requires accurate forecasting of customer growth and demand, which has become increasingly challenging. If overall demand for handsets or the mix of demand for handsets is significantly different than TDSs expectations, TDS could face inadequate or excess supplies of particular models of handsets. This could result in lost sales opportunities or a buildup of inventory that could not be easily sold. Either of 63 these situations could adversely affect TDSs revenues, costs of doing business, results of operations or financial condition. A failure by TDSs service offerings to meet customer expectations could limit TDSs ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse effect on TDSs operations. Customer acceptance of the services that TDS offers is and will continue to be affected by technology-based differences and by the operational performance, quality, reliability, and coverage of TDSs networks. TDS may have difficulty attracting and retaining customers if it is unable to meet customer expectations for, or otherwise unable to resolve quality issues relating to, its networks, billing systems, or customer care or if those issues limit TDSs ability to expand its network capacity or subscriber base, or otherwise place TDS at a competitive disadvantage to other service providers in its markets. The level of consumer demand for TDSs next-generation products is uncertain. Consumer demand could be impacted by differences in technology, footprint and service areas, network quality, consumer perceptions, customer care levels and rate plans. A failure by TDS to complete significant network build-out and system implementation as part of its plans to build out new markets and improve the quality and capacity of its network could have an adverse effect on its operations. TDSs business plan includes significant build-out activities and enhancements to its network, including completion of build-out activities in new markets and continual enhancement of its existing network. As TDS deploys, expands, and enhances its network, it may need to acquire additional spectrum. Also, as TDS continues to build out and enhance its network, TDS must, among other things, continue to: · lease, acquire or otherwise obtain rights to a large number of cell and switch sites; · obtain zoning variances or other local governmental or third-party approvals or permits for network construction; · complete the radio frequency design, including cell site design, frequency planning and network optimization, for each of TDSs markets; and · improve, expand and maintain customer care, network management, billing and other financial and management systems. Any difficulties encountered in completing these activities, as well as problems in vendor equipment availability, technical resources, system performance or system adequacy, could delay the launch of expanded operations in new or existing markets or result in increased costs in all markets. TDS relies on the services of various companies in order to build-out and enhance its network. However, TDS may not be able to obtain satisfactory contractors on economically attractive terms or ensure that such contractors or the systems they install will perform as TDS expects. Failure to successfully build out and enhance TDSs network and necessary support facilities and systems in a cost effective manner, and in a manner that satisfies customer expectations for quality and coverage, could have an adverse effect on TDSs business, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations. A failure by TDSs wireless business to acquire adequate radio spectrum could have an adverse effect on TDSs business and operations. TDSs wireless business depends on the ability to use portions of the radio spectrum licensed by the FCC. TDS could fail to obtain sufficient spectrum capacity in new and existing markets, whether through FCC auctions or other transactions, in order to meet the potential expanded demands for existing services in critical markets, and to enable deployment of next-generation services. Such a failure could have a material adverse impact on the quality of TDSs services or TDSs ability to roll out such future services in some markets, or could require that TDS curtail existing services in order to make spectrum available for next-generation services. TDS may acquire more spectrum through a 64 combination of alternatives, including participation in spectrum auctions. As required by law, the FCC periodically conducts auctions for licenses to use some parts of the radio spectrum. The decision to conduct auctions, and the determination of what spectrum frequencies will be made available for auction, are provided for by laws administered by the FCC. The FCC may not allocate spectrum sufficient to meet the demands of all those wishing to obtain licenses. Even if the FCC determines to conduct further auctions in the future, TDS may not be successful in those future auctions in obtaining the spectrum that TDS believes is necessary to implement its business and technology strategies. In addition, newly auctioned spectrum may not be compatible with existing spectrum, and vendors may not create suitable products to use such spectrum. TDS may also seek to acquire radio spectrum through purchases and exchanges with other spectrum licensees or otherwise, including by purchases of other licensees outright. However, TDS may not be able to acquire sufficient spectrum through these types of transactions, and TDS may not be able to complete any of these transactions on favorable terms. Financial difficulties of TDSs key suppliers or vendors, or termination or impairment of TDSs relationship with such suppliers or vendors, could result in a delay or termination of TDSs receipt of equipment or services, which could adversely affect TDSs business and results of operations. TDS depends upon certain vendors to provide it with equipment and services that TDS needs to continue TDSs network build-out and upgrade and operate its business. TDS does not have operational or financial control over any of such key suppliers and has limited influence with respect to the manner in which these key suppliers conduct their businesses. If these key suppliers experience financial difficulties and are unable to provide equipment or services to TDS on a timely basis or cease to provide such equipment or services, or if such key suppliers otherwise fail to honor their obligations to TDS, TDS may be unable to maintain and upgrade its network or provide services to its customers in a competitive manner, or could suffer other disruptions to its business. In that event, TDSs business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. An increase of TDSs debt in the future could subject TDS to various restrictions and higher interest costs and decrease its cash flows and earnings. TDS may increase its debt in the future, for acquisitions or other purposes. For example, TDS may require substantial additional financing to fund capital expenditures, license purchases, operating costs and expenses, domestic and international investments, and other growth initiatives. TDS currently relies on its committed credit facilities to meet any additional short-term financing needs. Other sources of financing may include public or private debt. The agreements governing any indebtedness may contain financial and other covenants that could impair TDSs flexibility and restrict TDSs ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, increased debt levels could result in higher interest costs and lower net cash flows and earnings. An inability to attract and/or retain management, technical, sales and other personnel could have an adverse effect on TDSs business, financial condition or results of operations. Due to competition for qualified engineering, technical, managerial, sales and other personnel, there can be no assurance that TDS will be able to continue to attract and/or retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business. The loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional qualified personnel in a timely manner would be detrimental to TDSs growth and activities requiring expertise. The failure to attract and/or retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on TDSs business, financial condition or results of operations. TDS has significant investments in entities that it does not control. Losses in the value of such investments could have an adverse effect on TDSs results of operations or financial condition. TDS has significant investments in entities that it does not control, including a 5.5% ownership interest in the Los Angeles SMSA Limited Partnership (the LA Partnership) which represents a significant portion of TDSs net income. TDS cannot provide assurance that these entities will operate 65 in a manner that will increase the value of TDSs investments, that TDSs proportionate share of income from the LA Partnership will continue at the current level in the future or that TDS will not incur losses from the holding of such investments. Losses in the values of such investments or a reduction in income from the LA Partnership could adversely affect TDSs financial condition or results of operations. Changes in guidance or interpretations of accounting requirements, changes in industry practice, identification of errors or changes in management assumptions could require amendments to or restatements of financial information or disclosures included in this or prior filings with the SEC. TDS prepares its consolidated financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and files such financial statements with the SEC in accordance with the SECs rules and regulations. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires TDS to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. TDS bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in guidance or interpretations of accounting requirements, changes in industry practice, identification of errors or changes in management assumptions could require amendments to or restatements of disclosures or financial information included in this or prior filings with the SEC. Uncertainty of access to capital for telecommunications companies, deterioration in the capital markets, other changes in market conditions, changes in TDSs credit ratings or other factors could limit or restrict the availability of financing on terms and prices acceptable to TDS, which could require TDS to reduce its construction, development and acquisition programs. TDS and its subsidiaries operate capital-intensive businesses. TDS has used internally-generated funds and has also obtained substantial funds from external sources to finance the build-out and enhancement of markets, to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. TDS also may require substantial additional capital for, among other uses, acquisitions of providers of wireless telecommunications services, spectrum license or system acquisitions, system development and network capacity expansion. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will continue to be available to TDS or its subsidiaries on terms or at prices acceptable to TDS. Uncertainty of access to capital for telecommunications companies, deterioration in the capital markets, other changes in market conditions, changes in TDSs credit ratings or other factors could limit or restrict the availability of financing on terms and prices acceptable to TDS, which could require TDS to reduce its construction, development and acquisition programs. In the long term, reduction of TDSs construction, development and acquisition programs would have a negative impact on TDSs consolidated revenues, income and cash flows. Changes in income tax rates, laws, regulations or rulings, or federal or state tax assessments could have an adverse effect on TDSs financial condition or results of operations. TDS does not have control over changes in income tax rates, laws, regulations or rulings, or federal and state tax assessments. Income and other federal or state taxes represent a significant expense for TDS. Accordingly, changes in income tax rates, laws, regulations or rulings, or federal and state tax assessments could have an adverse effect on TDSs financial condition or results of operations. 66 War, conflicts, hostilities and/or terrorist attacks or equipment failure, power outages, natural disasters or breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on TDSs business, financial condition or results of operations. Wars, conflicts, hostilities, terrorist attacks, major equipment failures, power outages, natural disasters, breaches of network or information technology security or similar disasters or failures that affect TDSs mobile and wireline telephone switching offices, information systems, microwave links, third-party owned local and long distance networks on which TDS relies, TDSs cell sites or other equipment or the networks of other providers on which TDS subscribers roam could have a material adverse effect on TDSs operations. TDSs inability to operate its telecommunications system or access or operate its information systems even for a limited time period, or the loss or disclosure of subscriber data, may result in a loss of subscribers or impair TDSs ability to serve subscribers or attract new subscribers, which could have an adverse effect on TDSs business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes in general economic and business conditions, both nationally and in the markets in which TDS operates could have an adverse effect on TDSs business, financial condition or results of operations. TDSs operating results may be subject to factors which are outside of TDSs control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, both nationally and in the markets in which TDS operates. Such factors could have a material adverse effect on TDSs business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes in facts or circumstances, including new or additional information that affects the calculation of potential liabilities for contingent obligations under guarantees, indemnities or otherwise, could require TDS to record charges in excess of amounts accrued in the financial statements, if any, which could have an adverse effect on TDSs financial condition or results of operations. The preparation of financial statements requires TDS to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. TDS bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in facts or circumstances, including new or additional information that affects the calculation of potential liabilities for contingent obligations under guarantees, indemnities or otherwise, could require TDS to record charges in excess of amounts accrued in the financial statements, if any, which could have an adverse effect on TDSs financial condition or results of operations. Material weaknesses in the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting could result in inaccurate financial statements or other disclosures or fail to prevent fraud, which could have an adverse effect on TDSs business, financial condition or results of operations. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, TDS is required to furnish a report of managements assessment of the design and effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as part of its Form 10-K filed with the SEC. The independent auditors of TDS are required to attest to, and report on, managements assessment and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. TDS management is also required to report on the effectiveness of TDSs disclosure controls and procedures. As disclosed in this Form 10-K, TDS management has identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and, accordingly, has determined that internal control over financial reporting was not effective at December 31, 2005. Reference is made to Item 9A of this Form 10-K for a description of such material weaknesses and deficiencies in the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Such material weaknesses and deficiencies in 67 the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting could result in inaccurate financial statements or other disclosures or fail to prevent fraud, which could have an adverse effect on TDSs business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, if TDS does not remediate any known material weaknesses, it could be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the SEC, it could fail to timely meet its regulatory reporting obligations, or investor perceptions could be negatively affected; each of these potential consequences could have an adverse effect on TDSs business, financial condition or results of operations. The pending SEC investigation regarding the restatement of TDSs financial statements could result in substantial expenses, and could result in monetary or other penalties. In November 2005, the staff of the SEC commenced an informal inquiry regarding TDSs accounting practices in response to the restatement that was announced in November 2005. TDS is cooperating fully with the SEC staff. However, depending upon the scope and duration of the SECs review, substantial expenses and diversion of managements attention and resources for the foreseeable future could be required. Also, if TDS is unsuccessful in defending against this or other investigations or proceedings, TDS could incur monetary or other penalties that could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. The possible development of adverse precedent in litigation or conclusions in professional studies to the effect that radio frequency emissions from handsets, wireless data devices and/or cell sites cause harmful health consequences, including cancer or tumors, or may interfere with various electronic medical devices such as pacemakers, could have an adverse effect on TDSs wireless business, financial condition or results of operations. Media reports have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health problems, including cancer or tumors, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. Concerns over radio frequency emissions may discourage use of wireless handsets or expose TDS to potential litigation. Any resulting decreases in demand for wireless services, or costs of litigation and damage awards, could impair TDSs ability to sustain profitability. In addition, some studies have indicated that some aspects of using wireless phones while driving may impair drivers attention in certain circumstances, making accidents more likely. These concerns could lead to potential litigation relating to accidents, deaths or serious bodily injuries, or to new restrictions or government regulations that restrict or prohibit wireless phone use, any of which could have an adverse effect on TDSs business, financial condition or results of operations. Numerous state and local legislative bodies have proposed legislation restricting or prohibiting the use of wireless phones while driving motor vehicles. These laws or, other laws if passed, prohibiting or restricting the use of wireless phones while driving, could have the effect of reducing subscriber usage, which could cause an adverse effect on TDSs business, financial condition, or results of operations. TDSs assets are concentrated in the U.S. telecommunications industry. As a result, its results of operations may fluctuate based on factors related entirely to conditions in this industry. TDSs assets are concentrated in the U.S. telecommunications industry, and in particular in the Midwestern portion of the United States. TDSs focus on the U.S. telecommunications industry, with concentrations of assets and operations in the Midwest, together with its positioning relative to larger competitors with greater resources within the industry, may represent increased risk for investors due to the lack of diversification. As TDS continues to implement its strategies, there are internal and external factors that could impact its ability to successfully meet its objectives. TDSs ability to implement and execute its operating strategies and as a result, achieve desired financial results, could be affected by various challenges. These challenges include overall industry- 68 related factors and other factors which are more specific to TDS, such as changes in regulation, industry-wide competition, changes in technology, effectiveness of TDSs information technology systems and other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed herein. If TDS does not successfully manage such challenges, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Any of the foregoing events or other events could cause revenues, customer additions, operating income, capital expenditures and or any other financial or statistical information to vary from TDSs forward estimates by a material amount. TDS may from time-to-time provide forward looking information, including estimates of future operating income; depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses; service revenues; net retail customer activations; and/or capital expenditures. Any such forward looking information includes the effect of known or anticipated changes to the extent disclosed, but unknown or unanticipated events, including the risks discussed above, could cause such estimates to differ from the actual amounts by a material amount. The market price of TDSs Common Shares and Special Common Shares is subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors. TDSs stock price is subject to fluctuations from time to time due to a variety of factors such as: · general economic conditions; · wireless and telecommunications industry conditions; · fluctuations in TDSs quarterly customer activations, churn rate, revenues, results of operations or cash flows; · variations between TDSs actual financial and operating results and those expected by analysts and investors; and · announcements by TDSs competitors. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect the future market price of TDSs stock, or cause the future market price of the stock to fluctuate from time to time. Certain matters, such as control by the TDS Voting Trust and provisions in the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation, may serve to discourage or make more difficult a change in control of TDS. A substantial majority of the outstanding Series A Common Shares are held in the TDS Voting Trust which expires on June 30, 2035. The TDS Voting Trust was created to facilitate the long-standing relationships among the trustees certificate holders. By virtue of the number of shares held by them, the voting trustees have the power to elect approximately 75% (less one) of the directors, or eight directors based on the current TDS Board of Directors size of twelve directors, and control a majority of the voting power of TDS with respect to matters other than the election of directors. The existence of the TDS Voting Trust is likely to deter any potential unsolicited or hostile takeover attempts or other efforts to obtain control of TDS and may make it more difficult for shareholders to sell shares of TDS at higher than market prices. The trustees of the TDS Voting Trust have advised TDS that they intend to maintain the ability to keep or dispose of voting control of TDS. The TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation and TDS Bylaws also contain provisions which may serve to discourage or make more difficult a change in control of TDS without the support of the Board of Directors or without meeting various other conditions. In particular, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation includes a provision which authorizes the TDS Board of Directors to consider various factors, including effects on customers, taxes, and the long-term and short-term interests of TDS, in the context of a proposal or offer to acquire or merge the corporation, or to sell its assets, and to reject such offer if the TDS Board of Directors determines that the proposal is not in the best interests 69 of the corporation based on such factors. The provisions of the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the TDS Bylaws and the existence of various classes of capital stock could prevent shareholders from profiting from an increase in the market value of their shares as a result of a change in control of TDS by delaying or preventing such change in control. The TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation also authorizes the TDS Board of Directors to designate and issue TDS Undesignated Shares in one or more classes or series of preferred or common stock from time to time. Generally, no further action or authorization by the shareholders is necessary prior to the designation or issuance of the additional TDS Undesignated Shares authorized pursuant to the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation unless applicable laws or regulations would require such approval in a given instance. Such TDS Undesignated Shares could be issued in circumstances that would serve to preserve control of TDSs then existing management. 70 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
