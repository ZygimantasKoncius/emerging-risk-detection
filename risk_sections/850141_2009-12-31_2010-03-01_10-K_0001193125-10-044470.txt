Item 1A. Risk Factors and in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-looking Information. Overview and Available Information Horace Mann Educators Corporation (HMEC; and together with its subsidiaries, the Company or Horace Mann) is an insurance holding company incorporated in Delaware. Through its subsidiaries, HMEC markets and underwrites personal lines of property and casualty (primarily private passenger automobile and homeowners) insurance, retirement annuities (primarily tax-qualified products) and life insurance in the United States of America (U.S.). HMECs principal insurance subsidiaries are Horace Mann Life Insurance Company (HMLIC), Horace Mann Insurance Company (HMIC) and Teachers Insurance Company (TIC), each of which is an Illinois corporation; Horace Mann Property & Casualty Insurance Company (HMPCIC), a California corporation; and Horace Mann Lloyds (HM Lloyds), an insurance company domiciled in Texas. The Company markets its products primarily to K-12 teachers, administrators and other employees of public schools and their families. The Companys nearly one million customers typically have moderate annual incomes, with many belonging to two-income households. Their financial planning tends to focus on retirement, security, savings and primary insurance needs. Management believes that Horace Mann is the largest national multiline insurance company focused on the nations educators as its primary market. Horace Mann markets and services its products primarily through a dedicated sales force of full-time agents trained to sell the Companys multiline products. These agents sell Horace Manns products and limited additional third-party vendor products authorized by the Company. Some of these agents are former educators or individuals with close ties to the educational community who utilize their contacts within, and knowledge of, the target market. This dedicated agent sales force is supplemented by an independent agent distribution channel for the Companys annuity products. The Companys insurance premiums written and contract deposits for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $1.0 billion and net income was $73.5 million. The Companys total assets were $6.3 billion at December 31, 2009. The Companys investment portfolio had an aggregate fair value of $4.6 billion at December 31, 2009. Investments consist principally of investment grade, publicly traded fixed income securities. 1 Table of Contents The Company conducts and manages its business through four segments. The three operating segments, representing the major lines of insurance business, are: property and casualty insurance, annuity products, and life insurance. The Company does not allocate the impact of corporate level transactions to the insurance segments, consistent with the basis for managements evaluation of the results of those segments, but classifies those items in the fourth segment, corporate and other. The property and casualty segment accounted for 55% of the Companys insurance premiums written and contract deposits for the year ended December 31, 2009; the annuity and life insurance segments together accounted for 45% of insurance premiums written and contract deposits for the year ended December 31, 2009 (35% and 10%, respectively). The Company is one of the largest participants in the 403(b) tax-qualified annuity market, measured by 403(b) net written premium on a statutory accounting basis. The Companys 403(b) tax-qualified annuities are voluntarily purchased by individuals employed by public school systems or other tax-exempt organizations through the employee benefit plans of those entities. The Company has approved 403(b) payroll reduction capabilities in approximately one-third of the 15,400 school districts in the U.S. The Companys annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of the Companys Internet Web site, www.horacemann.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The EDGAR filings of such reports are also available at the SECs Web site, www.sec.gov. Also available in the Investor Relations section of the Companys Web site are its corporate governance principles, code of conduct and code of ethics as well as the charters of the Boards Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Executive Committee, Investment and Finance Committee, and Nominating and Governance Committee. Louis G. Lower II, Chief Executive Officer of HMEC, timely submitted the Annual Section 12(a) CEO Certification to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on June 25, 2009 without any qualifications. The Company filed with the SEC, as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, the CEO and CFO certifications required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. History The Companys business was founded in Springfield, Illinois in 1945 by two school teachers to sell automobile insurance to other teachers within the State of Illinois. The Company expanded its business to other states and broadened its product line to include life insurance in 1949, 403(b) tax-qualified retirement annuities in 1961 and homeowners insurance in 1965. In November 1991, HMEC completed an initial public offering of its common stock (the IPO). The common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol HMN. 2 Table of Contents SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA The following consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet data have been derived from the consolidated financial statements of the Company, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

These intangible assets were fully amortized by December 31, 2009. (2) In 2008, the Companys federal income tax expense reflected a reduction of $4.2 million from the closing of tax years 2002, 2004, 2005 and 2006 with favorable resolution of the contingent tax liabilities related to those prior year taxes. For similar reasons, in 2005, the Companys federal income tax expense reflected a reduction of $9.1 million from the closing of tax years 1996 through 2001. (3) For the purpose of determining the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of income before income taxes or benefits and fixed charges, and fixed charges consist of interest expense (including amortization of debt issuance cost) and interest credited to policyholders on interest-sensitive contracts. (4) Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares and common stock equivalents outstanding. The Companys common stock equivalents relate to outstanding common stock options, Director Stock Plan units, Employee Stock Plan units and restricted stock units. The Companys Senior Convertible Notes, which were issued in May 2002, were considered potentially dilutive securities and were included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, to the extent dilutive. In May 2007, the Company redeemed all remaining Senior Convertible Notes. (5) Information regarding assets by segment at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is contained in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 13  Segment Information listed on page F-1 of this report. (6) The corporate and other segment primarily includes interest expense on debt and the impact of realized investment gains and losses, debt retirement costs and gains and certain public company expenses. 3 Table of Contents Corporate Strategy and Marketing The Horace Mann Value Proposition The Horace Mann Value Proposition articulates the Companys overarching strategy and business purpose: Provide lifelong financial well-being for educators and their families through personalized service, advice, and a full range of tailored insurance and financial products. Target Market Management believes that Horace Mann is the largest national multiline insurance company focused on the nations educators as its primary market. The Companys target market consists primarily of K-12 teachers, administrators and other employees of public schools and their families located throughout the U.S. The U.S. Department of Education estimates that there are approximately 6.2 million teachers, school administrators and education support personnel in public schools in the U.S.; approximately 3.2 million of these individuals are elementary and secondary teachers. Dedicated Agency Force A cornerstone of Horace Manns marketing strategy is its dedicated sales force of full-time agents trained to sell the Companys multiline products. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had 715 agents, approximately 75% of which are licensed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), to sell variable annuities and variable universal life policies. Some individuals in the agency force were previously teachers, other members of the education profession or persons with close ties to the educational community. The Companys dedicated agents are under contract to market only the Companys products and limited additional third-party vendor products authorized by the Company. Collectively, the Companys principal insurance subsidiaries are licensed to write business in 49 states and the District of Columbia. In 2006, the Company began the transition from a single-person agent operation to its Agency Business Model (ABM), with agents in outside offices with support personnel and licensed producers, designed to remove capacity constraints and increase productivity. The first Agency Business School (ABS) session was conducted in October 2006, beginning the formal roll-out of this model. Subsequently, ABS attendance has been offered to those agents who meet the Companys qualifications and demonstrate they are able to successfully migrate into the ABM model or begin their association with Horace Mann directly in the ABM model. On an ongoing basis, the Company will also provide follow-up training and support to those agents who have completed the school, to further embed repeatable processes and fully maximize the potential of ABM. Property and casualty initiatives to support that transition and drive business growth include the Companys Educator Segmentation Model  a more precise approach to pricing automobile and homeowners business  and its Product Management Organization  focused on localized approaches to pricing, underwriting and marketing. Also, the Company is developing a new property and casualty policy administration system with an automated point-of-sale front end. Annuity and life initiatives to support the transition to ABM included the roll out of additional Horace Mann manufactured and branded products, as described in Annuity Segment and Life Segment. 4 Table of Contents Building on the foundation of ABM, in the fourth quarter of 2008 the Company introduced its Exclusive Agent (EA) agreement which is designed to place agents in the position to become business owners and invest their own capital to grow their agencies. These independent contractors will be under contract and trained to market only the Companys multiline products and limited additional third-party vendor products authorized by the Company. By January 1, 2009, the first 71 individuals migrated from being employee agents to functioning as independent Exclusive Agents. Throughout 2009, additional employee agents migrated and other individuals were recruited and appointed directly into the EA agreement. By December 31, 2009, 249, or 35%, of the Companys dedicated agents were EAs. Going forward, the EA agreement will be offered to additional qualified employee agents. Management expects that all future agent recruits will be under the EA agreement. As indicated above, agents operating in the ABM model, both employee agents and EAs, utilize licensed producers in their operations. As of December 31, 2009, there were 571 licensed producers, resulting in a total of 1,286 points of distribution for the Companys products. Broadening Distribution Options To complement and extend the reach of the Companys agency force and to more fully utilize its approved payroll reduction slots in school systems across the country, the Company utilizes a network of independent agents to distribute the Companys 403(b) tax-qualified annuity products. In addition to serving educators in areas where the Company does not have dedicated agents, the independent agents complement the annuity capabilities of the Companys agency force in under-penetrated areas. At December 31, 2009, there were 832 independent agents approved to market the Companys annuity products throughout the U.S. During 2009, collected contract deposits from this distribution channel were approximately $64 million. 5 Table of Contents Geographic Composition of Business The Companys business is geographically diversified. For the year ended December 31, 2009, based on direct premiums and contract deposits for all product lines, the top five states and their portion of total direct insurance premiums and contract deposits were California, 7.6%; Florida, 6.9%; North Carolina, 6.7%; Illinois, 6.4%; and Texas, 5.4%. HMECs property and casualty subsidiaries are licensed to write business in 48 states and the District of Columbia.

The NEA has approximately 3.2 million members. The Company maintains a special advisory board, primarily composed of leaders of state education associations, that meets with Company management at least annually. The NEA and its affiliated state and local associations sponsor various insurance products and services of the Company and its competitors. The Company does not pay the NEA or any affiliated associations any consideration in exchange for sponsorship of Company products. The Company does pay for certain special functions and advertising that appears in NEA and state education association publications. The Company also has established relationships with a number of other educator groups, such as school administrator and principal associations, throughout the U.S. The Company does not pay these other educator groups any consideration in exchange for sponsorship of Company products. The Company does pay for certain special functions and advertising that appears in publications of these organizations. Property and Casualty Segment The property and casualty segment represented 55% of the Companys total insurance premiums written and contract deposits in 2009. The primary property and casualty product offered by the Company is private passenger automobile insurance, which in 2009 represented 37% of the Companys total insurance premiums written and contract deposits and 67% of property and casualty net written premiums. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately 528,000 voluntary automobile policies in force with annual premiums of approximately $375 million. The Companys automobile business is primarily preferred risk, defined as a household whose drivers have had no recent accidents and no more than one recent moving violation. In 2009, homeowners insurance represented 18% of the Companys total insurance premiums written and contract deposits and 32% of property and casualty net written premiums. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately 262,000 homeowners policies in force with annual premiums of approximately $198 million. The Company insures primarily residential homes. The Company has programs in a majority of states to provide higher-risk automobile and homeowners coverages, with third-party vendors underwriting and bearing the risk of such insurance and the Company receiving commissions on the sales. As an example, in Florida the Company has authorized its agents to write certain third-party vendors homeowners policies to help control the Companys coastal risk exposure. 7 Table of Contents Selected Historical Financial Information For Property and Casualty Segment The following table sets forth certain financial information with respect to the property and casualty segment for the periods indicated. Property and Casualty Segment Selected Historical Financial Information (Dollars in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Operations Data: Insurance premiums written $ 553.5 $ 545.9 $ 535.2 Insurance premiums earned 547.3 541.1 535.1 Net investment income 34.4 35.7 38.0 Income before income taxes 35.7 33.7 84.7 Net income 30.0 28.1 61.2 Catastrophe costs, pretax (1) 33.1 73.9 23.6 Operating Statistics: Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 74.4 % 76.9 % 67.4 % Expense ratio 25.1 % 23.8 % 24.5 % Combined loss and expense ratio 99.5 % 100.7 % 91.9 % Effect of catastrophe costs on the combined ratio (1) 6.1 % 13.7 % 4.4 % Automobile and Homeowners (Voluntary): Insurance premiums written Automobile $ 372.5 $ 367.8 $ 365.3 Homeowners 177.7 174.4 165.3 Total 550.2 542.2 530.6 Insurance premiums earned Automobile 369.8 365.5 364.6 Homeowners 174.3 172.3 160.5 Total 544.1 537.8 525.1 Policies in force (in thousands) Automobile 528 535 535 Homeowners 262 263 266 Total 790 798 801 (1) These measures are used by the Companys management to evaluate performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. These measures are components of net income but are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and require inclusion or exclusion of certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in a GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the Companys management, a discussion of these measures is meaningful to provide investors with an understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Companys periodic results of operations.  Catastrophe costs  The sum of catastrophe losses and property and casualty catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement premiums.  Catastrophe losses  In categorizing property and casualty claims as being from a catastrophe, the Company utilizes the designations of the Property Claims Service, a subsidiary of Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO), and additionally beginning in 2007, includes losses from all such events that meet the definition of covered loss in the Companys primary catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contract, and reports loss and loss adjustment expense amounts net of reinsurance recoverables. A catastrophe is a severe loss resulting from natural and man-made events within a particular territory, including risks such as hurricane, fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events, that causes $25 million or more in insured property and casualty losses for the industry and affects a significant number of property and casualty insurers and policyholders. Each catastrophe has unique characteristics. Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount of loss in advance. Their effects are not included in earnings or claim and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence. In the opinion of the Companys management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings. 8 Table of Contents Catastrophe Costs The level of catastrophe costs can fluctuate significantly from year to year. Catastrophe costs before federal income tax benefits for the Company and the property and casualty industry for the ten years ended December 31, 2009 were as follows: Catastrophe Costs (Dollars in millions) TheCompany (1) Property andCasualtyIndustry (2) Year Ended December 31, 2009 $ 33.1 $ 10,600.0 2008 73.9 25,200.0 2007 23.6 6,700.0 2006 19.8 9,200.0 2005 69.2 62,300.0 2004 75.5 27,500.0 2003 33.2 12,900.0 2002 11.9 5,900.0 2001 11.2 26,500.0 2000 16.2 4,600.0 (1) Net of reinsurance and before federal income tax benefits.

These amounts represent anticipated insured losses from catastrophes for personal and commercial property items, business interruption, terrorism, workers compensation and additional living expenses and exclude all loss adjustment expenses and are before federal income tax benefits. 9 Table of Contents Fluctuations from year to year in the level of catastrophe losses impact a property and casualty insurance companys loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and paid. For comparison purposes, the following table provides amounts for the Company excluding catastrophe losses: Impact of Catastrophe Losses (1) (Dollars in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Claims and claim expense incurred (2) $ 407.1 $ 416.1 $ 360.4 Amount attributable to catastrophes 33.1 73.9 23.6 Excluding catastrophes (2) $ 374.0 $ 342.2 $ 336.8 Claims and claim expense payments $ 404.9 $ 423.4 $ 365.5 Amount attributable to catastrophes 39.5 65.7 22.3 Excluding catastrophes $ 365.4 $ 357.7 $ 343.2 (1) Net of reinsurance and before federal income tax benefits. Includes allocated loss adjustment expenses. (2) Includes the impact of development of prior years reserves as quantified in Property and Casualty Reserves. Property and Casualty Reserves Property and casualty unpaid claims and claim settlement expenses (loss reserves) represent managements estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and settlement expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The Company calculates and records a single best estimate of the reserve as of each balance sheet date in conformity with generally accepted actuarial standards. For additional information regarding the process used to estimate property and casualty reserves, the risk factors involved and reserve development recorded in each of the three years ended December 31, 2009, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 4  Property and Casualty Unpaid Claims and Claim Expenses and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Policies  Liabilities for Property and Casualty Claims and Claim Settlement Expenses. All of the Companys property and casualty reserves for unpaid claims and claim settlement expenses are carried at the full value of estimated liabilities and are not discounted for interest expected to be earned on reserves. Due to the nature of the Companys personal lines business, the Company has no exposure to claims for toxic waste cleanup, other environmental remediation or asbestos-related illnesses other than claims under homeowners insurance policies for environmentally related items such as mold. 10 Table of Contents The following table is a summary reconciliation of the beginning and ending property and casualty insurance claims and claim expense reserves for each of the last three years. The table presents reserves on a net (after reinsurance) basis. The total net property and casualty insurance claims and claim expense incurred amounts are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations listed on page F-1 of this report. The end of the year gross reserve (before reinsurance) balances are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets also listed on page F-1 of this report.

(2) Reserves net of anticipated reinsurance recoverables. (3) Shows the amounts by which the Company decreased its reserves in each of the periods indicated for claims occurring in previous periods to reflect subsequent information on such claims and changes in their projected final settlement costs. For discussion of the reserve development recorded by the Company in 2009, 2008 and 2007, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 4  Property and Casualty Unpaid Claims and Claim Expenses listed on page F-1 of this report. (4) Benefits, claims and settlement expenses as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, listed on page F-1 of this report, also include life, annuity and group accident and health amounts of $51.6 million, $55.4 million and $48.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, in addition to the property and casualty amounts. The claim reserve development table below illustrates the change over time in the Net Reserves (defined in footnote 2 to the table above) established for property and casualty insurance claims and claim expenses at the end of various calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts of claims for which settlements have been made in cash as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of the Company learning additional facts that pertain to the unsettled claims. The fourth section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established, and indicates whether or not the original reserve was adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period, with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable. The claim reserve development table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years. 11 Table of Contents In evaluating the information in the table below, it should be noted that each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts of prior periods. For example, if a claim determined in 2008 to be $150 thousand was first reserved in 1999 at $100 thousand, the $50 thousand deficiency (actual claim minus original estimate) would be included in the cumulative deficiency in each of the years 1999-2007 shown below. This table presents development data by calendar year and does not relate the data to the year in which the accident actually occurred. Conditions and trends that have affected the development of these reserves in the past will not necessarily recur in the future. It may not be appropriate to use this cumulative history in the projection of future performance.

Net Reserves is a measure used by the Companys management to evaluate the overall adequacy of the property and casualty loss reserves and management believes it provides an alternative view of the Companys anticipated liabilities after reflecting expected recoveries from its reinsurers. This is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under applicable SEC rules because it is not displayed as a separate item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For balance sheet reporting, GAAP does not permit the Company to offset expected reinsurance recoveries against liabilities, yet management believes it is useful to investors to take these expected recoveries into account. These adjustments only affect the classification of these items in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and there is no impact on the Companys benefits, claims and settlement expenses incurred as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (2) For discussion of the reserve development, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 4  Property and Casualty Unpaid Claims and Claim Expenses listed on page F-1 of this report. 12 Table of Contents Property and Casualty Reinsurance All reinsurance is obtained through contracts which generally are renewed each calendar year. Although reinsurance does not legally discharge the Company from primary liability for the full amount of its policies, it does allow for recovery from assuming reinsurers to the extent of the reinsurance ceded. Historically, the Companys losses from uncollectible reinsurance recoverables have been insignificant due to the Companys emphasis on the credit worthiness of its reinsurers. Past due reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2009 were insignificant. The Company maintains catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance coverage. For 2009, the excess of loss coverage consisted of three contracts in addition to coverage with the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (FHCF). The primary contract (first event) provided 95% coverage of catastrophe losses above a retention of $25.0 million per occurrence up to $170.0 million per occurrence. This contract consisted of four layers, each of which provided for one mandatory reinstatement unless noted otherwise. The layers were $25.0 million excess of $25.0 million (82.5% provided for one mandatory reinstatement), $40.0 million excess of $50.0 million (92.25% provided for one mandatory reinstatement), $60.0 million excess of $90.0 million, and $20.0 million excess of $150.0 million. The second excess of loss contract (second event) provided 95% coverage of catastrophe losses above a retention of $15.0 million per occurrence up to $25.0 million per occurrence, after the Company retained $10.0 million of losses above $15.0 million per occurrence. The third excess of loss contract (third event) provided 95% coverage of catastrophe losses above a retention of $15.0 million per occurrence up to $25.0 million per occurrence, after the Company retained $10.0 million of losses above $15.0 million per occurrence and less than $25.0 million per occurrence, and after the second excess of loss contract described above was exhausted. Neither the second nor the third excess of loss contract provided for a reinstatement. In addition, the Companys predominant insurance subsidiary for property and casualty business written in Florida reinsured 90% of hurricane losses in that state above an estimated retention of $14.4 million up to $52.4 million, based on the FHCFs financial resources. The FHCF contract is a one-year contract, effective June 1, 2009. The decrease in FHCF coverage for the 2009-2010 contract period primarily reflects the Companys election not to purchase additional coverage as it did for the 2008-2009 contract period. This election was anticipated based on the Companys increase in coverage under its primary reinsurance contracts, which were finalized and priced prior to January 1, 2009. Additional coverage made available by the FHCF to the industry in future contract periods could increase the likelihood of assessments in periods following significant hurricane losses. For 2010, the Companys catastrophe excess of loss coverage consists of three contracts in addition to the FHCF. The primary contract (first event) provides 95% coverage of catastrophe losses above a retention of $25.0 million per occurrence up to $170.0 million per occurrence. This contract consists of three layers, each of which provide for one mandatory reinstatement. The layers are $25.0 million excess of $25.0 million, $40.0 million excess of $50.0 million, and $80.0 million excess of $90.0 million. The second excess of loss contract (second event) provides 95% coverage of catastrophe losses above a retention of $15.0 million per occurrence up to $25.0 million per occurrence, after the Company retains $10.0 million of losses above $15.0 million per occurrence. The third excess of loss contract (third event) provides 95% coverage of catastrophe losses above a retention of $15.0 million per occurrence up to $25.0 million per occurrence, after the Company retains $10.0 million of losses above $15.0 million per occurrence and less than $25.0 million per occurrence, and after the second excess of loss contract described above is exhausted. Neither the second 13 Table of Contents nor the third excess of loss contract provide for a reinstatement. The FHCF limits described in the previous paragraph continue through June 1, 2010, at which time a new annual contract may begin. The Company has not joined the California Earthquake Authority (CEA). The Companys exposure to losses from earthquakes is managed through its underwriting standards, its earthquake policy coverage limits and deductible levels, and the geographic distribution of its business, as well as its reinsurance program. After reviewing the exposure to earthquake losses from the Companys own policies and from what it would be with participation in the CEA, including estimated start-up and ongoing costs related to CEA participation, management believes it is in the Companys best economic interest to offer earthquake coverage directly to its homeowners policyholders. For liability coverages, in 2009 the Company reinsured each loss above a retention of $700,000 up to $2.5 million per occurrence and $20.0 million in a clash event. (A clash cover is a reinsurance casualty excess contract requiring two or more casualty coverages or policies issued by the Company to be involved in the same loss occurrence for coverage to apply.) For property coverages, in 2009 the Company reinsured each loss above a retention of $750,000 up to $2.5 million on a per risk basis, including catastrophe losses that in the aggregate were less than the retention levels above. Also, the Company could submit to the reinsurers three per risk losses from the same occurrence for a total of $5,250,000 of property recovery in any one event. Effective January 1, 2010, the retention for liability coverages is $750,000 up to $2.5 million on a per occurrence basis and $20.0 million in a clash event. Retention for property coverages remains $750,000, with no change to the maximum limits, including the ability to submit three per risk losses from the same occurrence. The following table identifies the Companys most significant reinsurers under the catastrophe first event excess of loss reinsurance program, their percentage participation in this program and their ratings by A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best) and Standard & Poors Corporation (S&P or Standard & Poors) as of January 1, 2010. No other single reinsurers percentage participation in 2010 or 2009 exceeds 5%. For 2009, the Companys catastrophe second event and third event excess of loss reinsurance was each provided by four reinsurers, although not the same four for both contracts, all rated A- (Excellent) or above by A.M. Best. For 2010, the Companys catastrophe second event and third event excess of loss reinsurance is provided by four reinsurers, all rated A- (Excellent) or above by A.M. Best.

Best. 14 Table of Contents Annuity Segment Beginning in 1961, educators in the Companys target market benefit from the provisions of Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). This section of the Code allows public school employees and employees of other tax-exempt organizations, such as not-for-profit private schools, to reduce their pretax income by making periodic contributions to a qualified retirement plan. (Also see Regulation  Regulation at Federal Level.) The Company entered the educators retirement annuity market in 1961 and is one of the largest participants in the 403(b) tax-qualified annuity market, measured by 403(b) net written premium on a statutory accounting basis. The Company has approved 403(b) payroll reduction capabilities in approximately one-third of the 15,400 school districts in the U.S. Approximately 61% of the Companys new annuity contract deposits in 2009 were for 403(b) tax-qualified annuities; approximately 73% of accumulated annuity value on deposit is 403(b) tax-qualified. In 2009, annuities represented 35% of the Companys total insurance premiums written and contract deposits. The Company markets tax-qualified annuities utilizing both fixed account only and combination contracts. The combination contract allows the contractholder to allocate funds to both fixed and variable alternatives. Under the fixed account option, both the principal and a rate of return are guaranteed. Contractholders of this product can change at any time their allocation of deposits between the guaranteed interest rate fixed account and available variable investment options. In general, the contractholder bears the investment risk related to funds allocated to variable investment options. Variable annuity contracts with a guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB) provide a benefit if the contractholder dies and the contract value is less than a contractually defined amount. The Company has a relatively low exposure to GMDB because approximately 27% of contract values have no guarantee; approximately 67% have only a return of premium guarantee; and only 6% have a guarantee of premium roll-up at an annual interest rate of 3% or 5%. In 2006, the Company introduced new Horace Mann manufactured and branded annuity products. The Goal Planning Annuity (GPA) offers educators a variable annuity product with a fixed interest account option and two optional riders that enhance the death benefit feature of the product. Developed with Wilshire Associates, the Companys funds advisor, GPA provides educators the opportunity to invest with fund families such as T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, Alliance, Davis, Ariel Capital Management and Putnam, among others. By utilizing tools that provide assistance in determining needs and making asset allocation decisions, educators are able to choose the investment mix that matches their personal risk tolerance and retirement goals. Expanding Horizon is a fixed interest rate annuity contract for more conservative investors. This product offers educators a competitive rate of interest on their retirement dollars and the choice of bonuses to optimize their benefits at retirement. Also in 2006, the Company added additional investment options to its variable annuity products. This included lifecycle funds, with assets allocated among multiple investment classes within each fund based on its specific target date. In August 2007, the Company completed development of group variable and fixed annuity products that allow greater flexibility in customizing 403(b) annuity programs to meet the needs of school districts. The first sales of these new group annuity products occurred in January 2008. 15 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2009, the Companys 56 variable account options included funds managed by some of the best-known names in the mutual fund industry, such as Wilshire, Fidelity, JPMorgan, T. Rowe Price, Neuberger Berman, AllianceBernstein, Rainier, Davis, Credit Suisse, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Dreyfus, Franklin Templeton, Ariel, Wells Fargo, Royce, Lord Abbett, Putnam and Delaware, offering the Companys customers multiple investment options to address their personal investment objectives and risk tolerance. Total accumulated fixed and variable annuity cash value on deposit at December 31, 2009 was $3.7 billion. To assist agents in delivering the Horace Mann Value Proposition, the Company has entered into a third-party vendor agreement with American Funds Distributors, Inc. (AFD) to market their retail mutual funds. In addition to retail mutual funds accounts, the Companys agents can also offer a 529 college savings program and Coverdell Education Savings Accounts utilizing AFD funds. The Company has also expanded its product offerings to include fixed indexed annuities and single premium immediate annuities through additional marketing alliances. Third-party vendors underwrite these accounts or contracts and the Company receives commissions on the sales of these products. 16 Table of Contents Selected Historical Financial Information For Annuity Segment The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the Companys annuity products for the periods indicated.

In 2006, the Company introduced Life by Design, a new portfolio of Horace Mann manufactured and branded life insurance products to better address the financial planning needs of educators. The Life by Design portfolio features new individual and joint whole life, and individual and joint term products, including 10-, 20- and 30-year level term policies. The Life by Design policies have premiums that are guaranteed for the duration of the contract and offer lower minimum face amounts. After December 31, 2006, the Company no longer issues new policies for its Experience Life product, a flexible, adjustable-premium life insurance contract that includes availability of an interest-bearing account. In 2009, the Company introduced a new discount for educator customers to improve the competitiveness of its life product portfolio. New marketing support tools were also introduced to aid the agency force. The Companys traditional term, whole life and group life business in force consists of approximately 145,000 policies, representing approximately $9.3 billion of life insurance in force, with annual insurance premiums and contract deposits of approximately $43.9 million as of December 31, 2009. In addition, the Company also had in force approximately 68,000 Experience Life policies, representing approximately $4.5 billion of life insurance in force, with annual insurance premiums and contract deposits of approximately $54.1 million. In 2009, the life segment represented 10% of the Companys total insurance premiums written and contract deposits, including less than 1 percentage point attributable to the Companys group life and group disability income business. During 2009, the average face amount of ordinary life insurance policies issued by the Company was $165,901 and the average face amount of all ordinary life insurance policies in force at December 31, 2009 was $75,845. The maximum individual life insurance risk retained by the Company is $200,000 on any individual life, while either $100,000 or $125,000 is retained on each group life policy depending on the type of coverage. The excess of the amounts retained are reinsured with life reinsurers that are rated A- (Excellent) or above by A.M. Best. The Company also maintains a life catastrophe reinsurance program. The Company reinsures 100% of the catastrophe risk in excess of $1 million up to $25 million per occurrence, with one reinstatement. The Companys catastrophe risk reinsurance program covers acts of terrorism and includes nuclear, biological and chemical explosions but excludes other acts of war. The Company has programs to offer long-term care policies, variable universal life policies and fixed interest rate universal life insurance with three third-party vendors underwriting such insurance. Under these programs, the third-party vendors underwrite and bear the risk of these insurance policies and the Company receives a commission on the sale of that business. 18 Table of Contents Selected Historical Financial Information For Life Segment The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the Companys life products for the periods indicated.

The insurance industry consists of a large number of insurance companies, some of which have substantially greater financial resources, more diversified product lines, greater economies of scale and/or lower-cost marketing approaches, such as direct marketing, mail, Internet and telemarketing, compared to the Company. In the Companys target market, management believes that the principal competitive factors in the sale of property and casualty insurance products are price, service, name recognition and education association sponsorships. Management believes that the principal competitive factors in the sale of life insurance and annuity products are product features, perceived stability of the insurer, service, name recognition, price and education association sponsorships. The Company competes in its target market with a number of national providers of personal automobile, homeowners and life insurance such as State Farm, Allstate, Farmers and Nationwide as well as several regional companies. The Company also competes for automobile business with other companies such as GEICO, Progressive and USAA, many of which feature direct marketing distribution. 19 Table of Contents Among the major national providers of annuities to educators, Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company (VALIC), a subsidiary of American International Group (AIG), is one of the Companys major tax-qualified annuity competitors, as are ING US Financial Services, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., MetLife and Security Benefit. For independent agents distributing the Companys 403(b) tax-qualified annuity products, Life Insurance Company of the Southwest, a subsidiary of National Life Insurance Company, is a major competitor. Mutual fund families, independent agent companies and financial planners also compete in this marketplace. The market for tax-deferred annuity products has been impacted by the new Internal Revenue Service Section 403(b) regulations, which made the 403(b) market more comparable to the 401(k) market than it has been in the past. While this may drive some competitors out of this market, it may make the 403(b) market more attractive to some of the larger 401(k) providers, including both insurance and mutual fund companies, that had not previously been active competitors in this business. Investments The Companys investments are selected to balance the objectives of protecting principal, minimizing exposure to interest rate risk and providing a high current yield. These objectives are implemented through a portfolio that emphasizes investment grade, publicly traded fixed income securities. When impairment of the value of an investment is considered other than temporary, the decrease in value is recorded and a new cost basis is established. At December 31, 2009, fixed income securities represented 89.6% of the Companys total investment portfolio, at fair value. Of the fixed income investment portfolio, 94.8% was investment grade and nearly 100% was publicly traded. At December 31, 2009, the average quality and average option-adjusted duration of the total fixed income portfolio were A+ and 6.8 years, respectively. At December 31, 2009, investments in non-investment grade fixed income securities represented 4.7% of the total investment portfolio, at fair value. There are no significant investments in mortgage whole loans, real estate, foreign securities, privately placed securities, or common stocks. As of December 31, 2009 and as of the time of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Companys securities lending program is suspended and no securities are on loan. The Company has separate investment strategies and guidelines for its property and casualty, annuity and life assets, which recognize different characteristics of the associated insurance liabilities, as well as different tax and regulatory environments. The Company manages interest rate exposure for its portfolios through asset/liability management techniques which attempt to coordinate the duration of the assets with the duration of the insurance policy liabilities. Duration of assets and liabilities will generally differ only because of opportunities to significantly increase yields or because policy values are not interest-sensitive, as is the case in the property and casualty segment. The investments of each insurance subsidiary must comply with the insurance laws of such insurance subsidiarys domiciliary state. These laws prescribe the type and amount of investments that may be purchased and held by insurance companies. In general, these laws permit investments, within specified limits and subject to certain qualifications, in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed bonds, other asset-backed bonds, preferred stocks, common stocks, real estate mortgages and real estate. 20 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the carrying values and amortized cost of the Companys investment portfolio as of December 31, 2009: Investment Portfolio (Dollars in millions) Percentage of Total Carrying Value AmortizedCost CarryingValue Total Life andAnnuity Property andCasualty Publicly Traded Fixed Maturity Securities, Equity Securities and Short-term Investments: U.S. government and agency obligations (1): Mortgage-backed securities 10.0 % $ 455.1 $ 438.3 $ 16.8 $ 436.8 Other 7.6 347.2 334.9 12.3 361.0 Investment grade corporate and public utility bonds 34.9 1,595.5 1,522.4 73.1 1,515.2 Municipal bonds 20.0 913.9 341.8 572.1 891.1 Other mortgage-backed securities (2) 11.0 503.2 498.6 4.6 566.3 Non-investment grade corporate and public utility bonds (3) 4.1 186.5 128.5 58.0 191.6 Foreign government bonds 0.9 41.9 39.7 2.2 39.9 Investment grade redeemable preferred stock 1.2 56.5 54.7 1.8 60.0 Non-investment grade redeemable preferred stocks (3)      Equity securities: Investment grade non-redeemable preferred stocks 1.1 47.7 35.1 12.6 52.3 Non-investment grade non-redeemable preferred stocks (3) 0.2 10.3 4.3 6.0 8.3 Common stocks  1.7 1.1 0.6 0.9 Short-term investments (4) 6.5 299.0 252.6 46.4 299.0 Short-term investments, loaned securities collateral (4)      Total publicly traded securities 97.5 4,458.5 3,652.0 806.5 4,422.4 Other Investments: Private placements, investment grade (5)      Private placements, non-investment grade (3) (5)  0.1 0.1  0.1 Mortgage loans (6)  2.5 2.5  2.5 Policy loans 2.5 113.5 113.5  113.5 Total other investments 2.5 116.1 116.1  116.1 Total investments (7) 100.0 % $ 4,574.6 $ 3,768.1 $ 806.5 $ 4,538.5 (1) Includes $370.5 million fair value of investments guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and $431.8 million fair value of federally sponsored agency securities which are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

See also Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Results of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 2009  Net Realized Investment Gains and Losses listed on page F-1 of this report. (3) A non-investment grade rating is assigned to a security when it is acquired or when it is downgraded from investment grade, primarily on the basis of the Standard & Poors Corporation (Standard & Poors or S&P) rating for such security, or if there is no S&P rating, the Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) rating for such security, or if there is no S&P or Moodys rating, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the NAIC) rating for such security. The rating agencies monitor securities, and their issuers, regularly and make changes to the ratings as necessary. The Company incorporates rating changes on a monthly basis. (4) Short-term investments mature within one year of being acquired and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Short-term investments represent $299.0 million in money market funds rated AAA. As of December 31, 2009 and the time of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Companys securities lending program is suspended. (5) Fair values for private placements are estimated by the Company with the assistance of its investment advisors. (6) Mortgage loans are carried at amortized cost or unpaid principal balance. (7) Approximately 7% of the Companys investment portfolio, having a carrying value of $322.3 million as of December 31, 2009, consisted of securities with some form of credit support, such as insurance. Of the securities with credit support as of December 31, 2009, municipal bonds represented $266.8 million carrying value. Of the securities with credit support 29% have the highest investment grade rating. 21 Table of Contents Fixed Maturity Securities and Equity Securities The following table sets forth the composition of the Companys fixed maturity securities and equity securities portfolios by rating as of December 31, 2009: Rating of Fixed Maturity Securities and Equity Securities(1) (Dollars in millions) Percentof TotalCarryingValue CarryingValue AmortizedCost Fixed maturity securities AAA 32.8 % $ 1,346.6 $ 1,326.7 AA 14.3 587.8 584.0 A 26.2 1,072.1 1,053.0 BBB 21.5 880.2 856.0 BB 3.2 129.5 146.8 B 1.9 77.6 87.7 CCC or lower 0.1 6.0 7.7 Not rated (2)  0.1 0.1 Total fixed maturity securities 100.0 % $ 4,099.9 $ 4,062.0 Equity securities AAA 10.1 % $ 6.0 $ 6.0 AA    A 27.5 16.4 18.4 BBB 44.0 26.3 29.0 BB 15.4 9.2 7.2 B    CCC or lower 0.2 0.1  Not rated (3) 2.8 1.7 0.9 Total equity securities 100.0 % $ 59.7 $ 61.5 (1) Ratings are as assigned primarily by S&P when available, with remaining ratings as assigned on an equivalent basis by Moodys. Ratings for publicly traded securities are determined when the securities are acquired and are updated monthly to reflect any changes in ratings. (2) Included in this category is $0.1 million fair value of private placement securities not rated by either S&P or Moodys. (3) This category represents common stocks that are not rated by either S&P or Moodys. At December 31, 2009, 25.2% of the Companys fixed maturity securities portfolio was expected to mature within the next 5 years. Mortgage-backed securities, including mortgage-backed securities of U.S. governmental agencies, represented 20.5% of the total investment portfolio at December 31, 2009. These securities typically have average lives shorter than their stated maturities due to unscheduled prepayments on the underlying mortgages. Mortgages are prepaid for a variety of reasons, including sales of existing homes, interest rate changes over time that encourage homeowners to refinance their mortgages and defaults by homeowners on mortgages that are then paid by guarantors. For financial reporting purposes, the Company has classified the entire fixed maturity portfolio as available for sale. Fixed maturities to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended to be held to maturity are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value. The net adjustment for unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale is recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity, net of applicable deferred tax asset or liability and the related impact on deferred policy acquisition costs associated with interest-sensitive life and annuity contracts. Fixed maturities held for indefinite periods of time include securities that management intends to use as part of its asset/liability management strategy and that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, resultant prepayment risk and other related factors, other than securities that are in an unrealized loss position for which management has the stated intent to hold until recovery. 22 Table of Contents Cash Flow As a holding company, HMEC conducts its principal operations through its subsidiaries. Payment by HMEC of principal and interest with respect to HMECs indebtedness, and payment by HMEC of dividends to its shareholders, are dependent upon the ability of its insurance subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or make other cash payments to HMEC, including tax payments pursuant to tax sharing agreements. Restrictions on the subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or to make other cash payments to HMEC may materially affect HMECs ability to pay principal and interest on its indebtedness and dividends on its common stock. The ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to HMEC is subject to state insurance department regulations which generally permit dividends to be paid for any 12 month period in amounts equal to the greater of (i) net income for the preceding calendar year or (ii) 10% of surplus, determined in conformity with statutory accounting principles, as of the preceding December 31st. Any dividend in excess of these levels requires the prior approval of the Director or Commissioner of the state insurance department of the state in which the dividend paying insurance subsidiary is domiciled. The aggregate amount of dividends that may be paid in 2010 from all of HMECs insurance subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval is approximately $64 million. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if insurance regulators otherwise determine that payment of a dividend or any other payment to an affiliate would be detrimental to an insurance subsidiarys policyholders or creditors, because of the financial condition of the insurance subsidiary or otherwise, the regulators may block dividends or other payments to affiliates that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval. Regulation General Regulation at State Level As an insurance holding company, HMEC is subject to extensive regulation by the states in which its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or transact business. In addition, the laws of the various states establish regulatory agencies with broad administrative powers to grant and revoke licenses to transact business, regulate trade practices, license agents, require statutory financial statements, and prescribe the type and amount of investments permitted. The NAIC has adopted risk-based capital guidelines to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to an insurance companys risks. State insurance regulations prohibit insurance companies from making any public statements or representations with regard to their risk-based capital levels. Based on current guidelines, the risk-based capital statutory requirements are not expected to have a negative regulatory impact on the Companys insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, statutory capital and surplus of each of the Companys insurance subsidiaries was above required levels. 23 Table of Contents Assessments Against Insurers Under insurance insolvency or guaranty laws in most states in which the Company operates, insurers doing business therein can be assessed for policyholder losses related to insolvencies of other insurance companies. The amount and timing of any future assessments on the Company under these laws cannot be reasonably estimated and are beyond the control of the Company. Most of these laws do provide, however, that an assessment may be excused or deferred if it would threaten an insurers financial strength, and many assessments paid by the Company pursuant to these laws may be used as credits for a portion of the Companys premium taxes in certain states. For the three years ended December 31, 2009, the Companys assessments, net of the related premium tax credits, were not significant. Insurers may also be assessed by entities such as the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation of Florida (Florida Citizens) and the Louisiana Citizens Fair and Coastal Plan (Louisiana Citizens) as a result of significant hurricane events. Related to such assessments levied in 2005 and 2006, insurers were permitted to in turn assess its policyholders in the respective states to recoup the amounts remitted to Florida Citizens and Louisiana Citizens. Mandatory Insurance Facilities The Company is required to participate in various mandatory insurance facilities in proportion to the amount of the Companys direct writings in the applicable state. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company reflected pretax net gains (losses) from participation in such mandatory pools and underwriting associations of $(0.8) million, $0.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively. In addition to the pretax net loss from these mandatory participations in 2009, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $3.8 million to write off its equity interest in the accumulated surplus of the North Carolina Beach Plan. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Results of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 2009  Other Income listed on page F-1 of this report. Regulation at Federal Level Although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance industry, federal initiatives often impact the insurance business. Current and proposed federal measures which may significantly affect insurance and annuity business include employee benefits regulation, controls on the costs of medical care, medical entitlement programs such as Medicare, structure of retirement plans and accounts, changes to the insurance industry anti-trust exemption, and minimum solvency requirements. Other federal regulation such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and USA PATRIOT Act, including its anti-money laundering regulations, also impact the Companys business. The variable annuities underwritten by HMLIC are regulated by the SEC. Horace Mann Investors, Inc., the broker-dealer subsidiary of HMEC, also is regulated by the SEC, FINRA, the Municipal Securities Rule-making Board (MSRB) and various state securities regulators. 24 Table of Contents Federal income taxation of the build-up of cash value within a life insurance policy or an annuity contract could have a materially adverse impact on the Companys ability to market and sell such products. Various legislation to this effect has been proposed in the past, but has not been enacted. Although no such legislative proposals are known to exist at this time, such proposals may be made again in the future. Changes in other federal and state laws and regulations could also affect the relative tax and other advantages of the Companys life and annuity products to customers. For instance, new Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Section 403(b) regulations were effective January 1, 2009 with limited exceptions. The new regulations altered the nature of 403(b) arrangements causing them to more closely resemble other traditional employer sponsored plans, compared to the historical view of 403(b) arrangements being individual plans funded by salary reduction. Under the new regulations, contributions to Section 403(b) tax-qualified arrangements, including annuities, are required to be made pursuant to a written plan which includes all of the terms and conditions for eligibility, limitations and benefits under the plan, and which may incorporate other documents by reference including annuity contracts issued by approved product providers. Other highlights of the new regulations include modified distribution and transfer rules and the incorporation of numerous positions previously taken by the IRS since last issuing formal comprehensive Section 403(b) regulations in 1964. While the deadline for plan sponsors to have a formal written plan in place was extended until December 31, 2009, such plans were required to satisfy the regulations that were in effect as of January 1, 2009, and sponsors had to correct operations that were in conflict with the terms of the plan as of the plans effective date. Since the proposed new regulations were promulgated in 2004, the Company, and many other providers of 403(b) arrangements, had been adapting its administrative systems, products and services offered to better meet the changing needs of the school district sponsors of 403(b) plans. The lead time to the effective date, combined with preparations made by the Company since the new regulations were first proposed, provided time to assist the key school districts where Horace Mann has Section 403(b) payroll slots with the development of their written plans and to implement the new products and services required to enable the Company to continue to effectively serve this market. One immediate impact of the new Section 403(b) regulations has been that previous rules governing a participants ability to exchange one 403(b) annuity or funding agreement for another without incurring income tax liability were changed effective September 25, 2007. Under the new regulations, plan sponsors control whether such exchanges are even permitted within their plan, and which providers are eligible to receive them. The fact that this change occurred prior to the effective date of the remainder of the new regulations created some confusion among plan sponsors and product providers in the period from September 25, 2007 through December 2008, which slowed the pace of such exchanges. This contributed to both reduced sales and improved retention for the Company in 2008 and also impacted the industry as a whole. As anticipated, a return to a more normal flow of exchanges was experienced during 2009 as sponsors and providers became more comfortable with the new rules, resulting in a significant increase in overall single premium and rollover sales compared to 2008 and 2007. 25 Table of Contents Proposed Federal Oversight of Financial Institutions As of the time of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, consideration of significant reform of the federal oversight of financial institutions is underway by the 111th Congress and the Obama Administration. A central objective of this reform is establishment of new federal oversight of the systemic risk posed by the various financial institutions and their products and services to the broader U.S. economy. The question of the extent to which the insurance industry poses such risk and whether it should be the subject of federal regulation is unsettled in these reform debates. Proposals for federal oversight of the insurance industry range from comprehensive supervision through an optional federal charter to a more circumspect approach of establishing a federal insurance information office. Management will closely monitor these developments for impact on the Company, insurers of similar size and the insurance industry as a whole. Employees At December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately 1,400 non-agent employees and 466 full-time employee agents. (This does not include 249 Exclusive Agent independent contractors that were part of the Companys total dedicated agency force at December 31, 2009.) The Company has no collective bargaining agreement with any employees. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors The following are certain risk factors that could affect the Companys business, financial results and results of operations. In addition, refer to the risk factors disclosed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-looking Information, listed on page F-1 of this report for certain important factors that may cause our financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from current expectations. The risks that the Company has highlighted in these two sections of this report are not the only ones that the Company faces. In this discussion, the Company is also referred to as our, we and us. The Companys business involves various risks and uncertainties which are based on the lines of business the Company writes as well as more global risks associated with the general business and insurance industry environments. Volatile financial markets and economic environments can impact financial markets risk as well as our financial condition and results of operations. Financial markets in the U.S. and elsewhere can experience extreme volatility and disruption for uncertain periods of time. In 2008 and 2009, volatility occurred largely due to the stresses affecting the global banking system, which accelerated significantly in the second half of 2008. The U.S. entered a severe recession that, while moderating, is likely to persist well into and perhaps even beyond 2010, despite governmental intervention in the economy. These circumstances exerted significant downward pressure on prices of equity securities and many other investment asset classes and resulted in substantially increased market volatility, severely constrained credit and capital markets, particularly for financial institutions, and an overall loss of investor confidence. Like other financial institutions, which face significant financial markets risk in their operations, the Company was adversely affected by these conditions and could be adversely impacted by similar circumstances in the future. 26 Table of Contents In addition to the effects of financial markets volatility, a prolonged economic recession may have other adverse impacts on our financial condition and results of operations such as: our volume of new business for automobile, homeowners, annuity and life products could be diminished; our policy renewal rates could decrease; the inflow of annuity contract deposit receipts could decrease; surrenders of annuity contracts and related withdrawals of accumulated deposits could increase; property and casualty claims related to uninsured motorists, arson or fraudulent information may increase; the market value of our investment portfolio could be impacted by economic effects on the issuers of the securities we hold; and taxing authorities could increase rates or implement new tax elements in efforts to offset their declining revenues. If our investment strategy is not successful, we could suffer unexpected losses. The success of our investment strategy is crucial to the success of our business. Specifically, our fixed income portfolio is subject to a number of risks including:  market value risk, which is the risk that our invested assets will decrease in value due to a change in the yields realized on our assets and prevailing market yields for similar assets, an unfavorable change in the liquidity of the investment or an unfavorable change in the financial prospects or a downgrade in the credit rating of the issuer of the investment;  credit risk, which is the risk that the value of certain investments becomes impaired due to deterioration in financial condition of one or more issuers of those instruments or the deterioration in performance or credit quality of the underlying collateral of certain structured securities and, ultimately, the risk of permanent loss in the event of default by an issuer or underlying credit;  market fundamentals risk, which is the risk that there are changes in the market that can have an unfavorable impact on securities valuation such as availability of credit in the capital markets, re-pricing of credit risk, reduced market liquidity, and increased market volatility;  reinvestment risk, which is the risk that interest rates will decline and funds reinvested will earn less than expected;  concentration risk, which is the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of deterioration in the financial condition of those issuers or the market value of their securities;  liquidity risk, which is the risk that liabilities are surrendered or mature sooner than anticipated requiring us to sell assets at an undesirable time to provide for policyholder surrenders, withdrawals or claims; and  regulatory risk, which is the risk that regulatory bodies or governments, in the U.S. or in other countries, may make substantial investments or take significant ownership positions in, or ultimately nationalize, financial institutions or other issuers of securities held in the Companys investment portfolio, which could adversely impact the seniority or contractual terms of the securities. In addition to significant steps taken to attempt to mitigate these risks through our investment guidelines, policies and procedures, we also attempt to mitigate these risks through product pricing, product features and the establishment of policy reserves, but we cannot provide assurance that assets will be properly matched to meet anticipated liabilities or that our investments will provide sufficient returns to enable us to satisfy our guaranteed fixed benefit obligations. 27 Table of Contents Although historically the Company has not been a party to these transactions, from time to time we could also enter into foreign currency, interest rate, credit derivative and other hedging transactions in an effort to manage risks. We cannot provide assurance that we will successfully structure those derivatives and hedges so as to effectively manage these risks. If our calculations are incorrect, or if we do not properly structure our derivatives or hedges, we may have unexpected losses and our assets may not be adequate to meet our needed reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Declining financial markets could also cause, and in the past have caused, the value of the investments in our defined benefit pension plan to decrease, resulting in additional pension expense, a reduction in other comprehensive income and an increase in required contributions to the defined benefit pension plan. Our annuity business may be, and in the past has been, adversely affected by volatile or declining financial market conditions. Conditions in the U.S. and international financial markets affect the sale and profitability of our annuity products. In general, sales of variable annuities decrease when financial markets are declining or experiencing a higher than normal level of volatility over an extended period of time. Therefore, weak and/or volatile financial market performance may adversely affect sales of our variable annuity products to potential customers, may cause current customers to withdraw or reduce the amounts invested in our variable annuity products and may reduce the market value of existing customers investments in our variable annuity products, in turn reducing the amount of variable annuity fee revenues generated. In addition, some of our variable annuity contracts offer guaranteed minimum death benefit features, which provide for a benefit if the contractholder dies and the contract value is less than a specified amount. A decline in the financial markets could cause the contract value to fall below this specified amount, increasing our exposure to losses from variable annuity products featuring guaranteed minimum death benefits. Declining or volatile financial markets may also impact the valuations of deferred policy acquisition costs. Interest rate fluctuations could negatively affect the income we derive from the difference between the interest rates we earn on our investments and the interest we pay under our fixed annuity and interest-sensitive life contracts. Significant changes in interest rates expose us to the risk of not earning income or experiencing losses based on the differences between the interest rates earned on our investments and the credited interest rates paid on our outstanding fixed annuity and interest-sensitive life contracts. Significant changes in interest rates may affect:  the unrealized gains and losses in our investment portfolio and the related after-tax effect on our shareholders equity and total capital;  the book yield of our investment portfolio; and  the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain appropriate interest rate spreads over the fixed rates guaranteed in their life and annuity products. Both rising and declining interest rates can negatively affect the income we derive from these interest rate spreads. During periods of falling interest rates, our investment earnings will be lower because new investments in fixed maturity securities will likely bear lower interest rates. We may not be able to fully offset the decline in investment earnings with lower crediting rates on our annuity contracts. During periods of rising interest rates, there may be competitive pressure to increase the crediting rates on our annuity contracts. We may not, 28 Table of Contents however, have the ability immediately to acquire investments with interest rates sufficient to offset an increase in crediting rates under our annuity contracts. Although we develop and maintain asset/liability management programs and procedures designed to reduce the volatility of our income when interest rates are rising or falling, changes in interest rates can affect our interest rate spreads. Changes in interest rates may also affect our business in other ways. For example, a rapidly changing interest rate environment may result in less competitive crediting rates on certain of our fixed-rate products which could make those products less attractive, leading to lower sales and/or increases in the level of life insurance and annuity product surrenders and withdrawals. Interest rate fluctuations may also impact the valuations of deferred policy acquisition costs. Losses due to defaults by others could reduce our profitability or negatively affect the value of our investments. Third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets may not pay or perform their obligations. These parties may include the issuers whose securities we hold, borrowers under mortgage loans, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, downturns in the economy or real estate values, operational failure or other reasons. The default of a major market participant could disrupt the securities markets or clearance and settlement systems in the U.S. or abroad. A failure of a major market participant could cause some clearance and settlement systems to assess members of that system, including our broker-dealer subsidiary, or could lead to a chain of defaults that could adversely affect us. A default of a major market participant could disrupt various markets, which could in turn cause market declines or volatility and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Underwriting results of property and casualty insurers are subject to weather and other conditions prevailing in an accident year. While one year may be relatively free of major weather or other disasters, another year may have numerous such events causing results for such a year to be materially worse than for other years. Our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have experienced, and we anticipate that in the future they will continue to experience, catastrophe losses. A catastrophic event or a series of multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries. 29 Table of Contents Various events can cause catastrophes, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, terrorism, explosions, severe winter weather and wildfires. The frequency and severity of these catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposures in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Although catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of property and casualty lines, most of the catastrophe-related claims of our insurance subsidiaries are related to homeowners coverages. Our ability to provide accurate estimates of ultimate catastrophe costs is based on several factors, including:  the proximity of the catastrophe occurrence date to the date of our estimate;  potential inflation of property repair costs in the affected area;  the occurrence of multiple catastrophes in a geographic area over a relatively short period of time; and  the outcome of litigation which may be filed against the Company by policyholders, state attorneys general and other parties relative to loss coverage disputes and loss settlement payments. Based on 2009 direct premiums earned, approximately 58% of the total annual premiums for our property and casualty business were for policies issued in the ten largest states in which our insurance subsidiaries write property and casualty coverage. Included in this top ten group are certain states which are considered to be more prone to catastrophe occurrences: Florida, California, North Carolina, Texas, Louisiana, South Carolina and Georgia. As an ongoing practice, but particularly following the significant catastrophic claims from hurricanes in 2005 and 2004, we attempt to manage our exposure to catastrophes. Reductions in property and casualty business written in catastrophe-prone areas, including an additional risk reduction program initiated in Florida in 2010, may have a negative impact on near-term business growth and results of operations. In addition to the potential impact on our property and casualty subsidiaries, our life subsidiary could experience claims of a catastrophic magnitude from events such as pandemics; terrorism; nuclear, biological or chemical explosions; or other acts of war. Our insurance subsidiaries seek to reduce their exposure to catastrophe losses through their underwriting strategies and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance. Nevertheless, reinsurance may prove inadequate if:  a major catastrophic loss exceeds the reinsurance limit;  a series of major catastrophic events in a single year exhaust the reinsurance coverage; or  an insurance subsidiary incurs multiple, smaller catastrophic losses which, individually, do not exceed the subsidiarys loss retention level. 30 Table of Contents Uncollectible reinsurance, as well as reinsurance availability and pricing, can have a material adverse effect upon our business volume and profitability. Reinsurance is a contract by which one insurer, called a reinsurer, agrees to cover a portion of the losses incurred by a second insurer in the event a claim is made under a policy issued by the second insurer. Our insurance subsidiaries obtain reinsurance to help manage their exposure to property, casualty and life insurance risks. Although a reinsurer is liable to our insurance subsidiaries according to the terms of its reinsurance policy, the insurance subsidiaries remain primarily liable as the direct insurers on all risks reinsured. As a result, reinsurance does not eliminate the obligation of our insurance subsidiaries to pay all claims, and each insurance subsidiary is subject to the risk that one or more of its reinsurers will be unable or unwilling to honor its obligations. Although we limit participation in our reinsurance programs to reinsurers with high financial strength ratings, our insurance subsidiaries cannot guarantee that their reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion, if at all. Reinsurers may become financially unsound by the time that they are called upon to pay amounts due, which may not occur for many years. In the case of the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (FHCF), financial deficits and difficulties in accessing the capital markets may require the FHCF to make additional assessments against participating insurers. Additional coverage made available by the FHCF to the insurance industry in future contract periods, as was done for the 2007 through 2009 contract periods, could increase the likelihood of assessments in periods following significant hurricane losses. Additionally, the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions beyond our control. For example, significant losses from hurricanes or terrorist attacks or an increase in capital requirements could have a significant adverse impact on the reinsurance market. If one of our insurance subsidiaries is unable to obtain adequate reinsurance at reasonable rates, that insurance subsidiary would have to increase its risk exposure and/or reduce the level of its underwriting commitments, which could have a material adverse effect upon the business volume and profitability of the subsidiary. Alternately, the insurance subsidiary could elect to pay the higher than reasonable rates for reinsurance coverage, which could have a material adverse effect upon its profitability until policy premium rates could be raised, in some cases subject to approval by state regulators, to incorporate this additional cost. Our property and casualty loss reserves may not be adequate. Our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries maintain loss reserves to provide for their estimated ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period. If these loss reserves prove inadequate, we will record a loss measured by the amount of the shortfall and, as a result, the financial condition and results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries will be adversely affected, potentially affecting their ability to distribute cash to the holding company. 31 Table of Contents Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Reserves represent estimates, generally involving actuarial projections at a given time, of what our insurance subsidiaries expect the ultimate settlement and adjustment of claims will cost, net of salvage and subrogation. Estimates are based on assessments of known facts and circumstances, assumptions related to the ultimate cost to settle such claims, estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency, changing judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both internal and external events, including changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation, unpredictability of court decisions, plaintiffs expanded theories of liability, risks inherent in major litigation and legislative changes. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Significant reporting lags may exist between the occurrence of an insured event and the time it is actually reported. Our insurance subsidiaries adjust their reserve estimates regularly as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. Due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, we cannot be certain that the ultimate liability will not exceed amounts reserved, with a resulting adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Many scientists indicate that the world is getting warmer. Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency and/or severity of weather events and wildfires, the affordability and availability of our catastrophe reinsurance coverage, and our results of operations. Our risks related to catastrophic events and reinsurance are disclosed in more detail above. If an increase in weather events and/or wildfires were to occur, in addition to the attendant increase in claim costs, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition, concentrations of insurance risk could impact our ability to make homeowners insurance available to our clients. This could adversely impact our volume of business and our results of operations or cash flows. New laws and regulations that may be implemented as a result of climate change also could have an adverse impact on our cost of doing business and our results of operations or cash flows. Deviations from assumptions regarding future market appreciation, interest spreads, persistency, mortality and morbidity used in calculating life and annuity reserves and deferred policy acquisition expense amounts could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The processes of calculating reserve and deferred policy acquisition expense amounts for our life and annuity businesses involve the use of a number of assumptions, including those related to market appreciation (the rate of growth in market value of the underlying variable annuity subaccounts due to price appreciation), interest spreads (the interest rates expected to be received on investments less the rate of interest credited to contractholders), persistency (how long a contract stays with the company), mortality (the relative incidence of death over a given period of time) and morbidity (the relative incidence of disability resulting from disease or physical impairment). We periodically review the adequacy of these reserves and deferred policy acquisition expenses on an aggregate basis and, if future experience is estimated to differ significantly from previous assumptions, adjustments to reserves and deferred policy acquisition expenses may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 32 Table of Contents An impairment of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. At December 31, 2009, we had $47.4 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill was recorded when the Company was acquired in 1989 and when Horace Mann Property & Casualty Insurance Company was acquired in 1994, in both instances reflecting the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired. The December 31, 2009 balance was evaluated for impairment, as described in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, with no impairment charge resulting from such assessment. If an evaluation of the Companys fair value or of the Companys segments fair value indicated that all or a portion of the goodwill balance was impaired, the Company would be required to write off the impaired portion. Such a write-off could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any downgrade in or adverse change in outlook for our claims-paying ratings, financial strength ratings or credit ratings could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Claims-paying ratings and financial strength ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. In the evolving 403(b) annuity market, school districts and benefit consultants have been placing increased emphasis on the relative financial strength ratings of competing companies. Each rating agency reviews its ratings periodically and from time to time may modify its rating criteria including, among other factors, its expectations regarding capital adequacy, profitability and revenue growth. A downgrade in the ratings or adverse change in the ratings outlook of any of our insurance subsidiaries by a major rating agency could result in a substantial loss of business for that subsidiary if school districts, policyholders or independent agents move their business to other companies having higher claims-paying ratings and financial strength ratings than we do. This loss of business could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of that subsidiary. The financial covenants related to the Companys outstanding indebtedness, including the Bank Credit Agreement, consist primarily of relationships of (1) debt to capital, (2) insurance subsidiaries insurance financial strength ratings issued by A.M. Best and (3) net worth, as defined in the financial covenants. For instance, if the insurance subsidiaries A.M. Best financial strength rating is lowered beneath the A- rating assigned at the time of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company would be in default under its Bank Credit Agreement. This could adversely impact our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. A downgrade in our holding company debt rating could adversely impact our cost and flexibility of borrowing which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 33 Table of Contents Reduction of the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect their ability to write insurance business. Insurance companies write business based, in part, upon guidelines including a ratio of premiums to surplus for property and casualty insurance companies and a ratio of reserves to surplus for life insurance companies. If our insurance subsidiaries cannot maintain profitability in the future or if significant investment valuation losses are incurred, they may be required to draw on their surplus in order to pay dividends to us to enable us to meet our financial obligations. As their surplus is reduced by the payment of dividends, continuing losses or both, our insurance subsidiaries ability to write business and maintain acceptable financial strength ratings could also be reduced. This could have a material adverse effect upon the business volume and profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. If we are not able to effectively develop and expand our marketing operations, including agents and other points of distribution, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our success in marketing and selling our products is largely dependent upon the efforts of our full-time, dedicated agent sales force and the success of their agency operations. As we expand our business, we may need to expand the number of agencies marketing our products. If we are unable to appoint additional agents, fail to retain current agents or are unable to increase the productivity of agency operations, sales of our products would likely decline and our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Since 2006, the Company has been transitioning from a single-person agent operation to its Agency Business Model, with agents in outside offices with support personnel and licensed producers, designed to remove capacity constraints and increase productivity. Building on this foundation, in 2009 the Company began offering the opportunity for agents to be appointed by the Company as non-employee, independent contractor, Exclusive Agents. If we and the agency force are unable to successfully implement these approaches to expanding our points of distribution and further increasing the productivity of agents, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If we are not able to maintain and secure (1) payroll reduction authorizations and (2) product sponsorships and other relationships with the educational community, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our ability to successfully grow new business in the educator market is largely dependent on our ability to effectively access educators either in their school buildings or through other approaches. While this is especially true for the sale of 403(b) tax-qualified annuity products via payroll reduction, any significant decrease in access, either through fewer payroll slots, increased security measures or other causes could potentially adversely affect the sale of all lines of our business and require us to change our traditional worksite marketing and advertising approach. With the changes in the IRS regulations regarding Section 403(b) arrangements, including annuities, our ability to maintain and grow our share of the 403(b) market, and the access it gives us for other product lines, will depend on our ability to successfully adapt our products, services offered, and administrative systems, which could potentially increase our cost of doing business in this market. School districts and benefit consultants have been placing additional emphasis on the relative financial strength ratings of competing companies, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other more highly-rated insurance companies. See also Business  Regulation  Regulation at Federal Level. 34 Table of Contents Our ability to maintain and obtain product sponsorships from local, state and national education associations is important to our marketing strategy. Horace Mann has had a long relationship with the NEA, the nations largest confederation of state and local teachers associations, and many of the state and local education associations affiliated with the NEA. In addition to these organizations, we have established relationships with various other educator, principal and school administrator groups. These contacts and endorsements help to establish our brand name and presence in the educational community and to enhance our access to educators. The insurance industry is highly regulated. We are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Each jurisdiction has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. Furthermore, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers. Regulation generally is designed to protect the interests of policyholders, as opposed to stockholders and non-policyholder creditors. Such regulations, among other things, impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments our subsidiaries may hold. Certain states also regulate the rates insurers may charge for certain property and casualty products. Legislation and voter initiatives have expanded, in some instances, the states regulation of rates and have increased data reporting requirements. Consumer-related pressures to roll back rates, even if not enacted by legislation or upheld upon judicial appeal, may affect our ability to obtain timely rate increases or operate at desired levels of profitability. Changes in insurance regulations, including those affecting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to distribute cash to us and those affecting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to write profitable property and casualty insurance policies in one or more states, may adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries. In addition, consumer privacy requirements may increase our cost of processing business. Our ability to comply with laws and regulations, at a reasonable cost, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success. Examples of governmental regulation that has adversely affected the operations of our insurance subsidiaries include:  the adoption in several states of legislation and other regulatory action intended to reduce the premiums paid for automobile and homeowners insurance by residents of those states;  limitations on the use of key underwriting information, such as consumer credit or occupation, to properly price the assumed risk;  restrictions on a companys ability to achieve pricing adequacy and/or reduce their volume of business in catastrophe prone areas; and  requirements that insurance companies:  pay assessments to support associations that fund state-sponsored insurance operations, or  involuntarily issue policies for high-risk automobile drivers. 35 Table of Contents Regulation that could adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries also includes statutory surplus and risk-based capital requirements. Maintaining appropriate levels of surplus, as measured by statutory accounting principles, is considered important by state insurance regulatory authorities and the private agencies that rate insurers claims-paying abilities and financial strength. The failure of an insurance subsidiary to maintain levels of statutory surplus that are sufficient for the amount of its insurance written could result in increased regulatory scrutiny, action by state regulatory authorities or a downgrade by rating agencies. Similarly, the NAIC has adopted a system of assessing minimum capital adequacy that is applicable to our insurance subsidiaries. This system, known as risk-based capital, is used to identify companies that may merit further regulatory action by analyzing the adequacy of the insurers surplus in relation to statutory requirements. Because state legislatures remain concerned about the availability and affordability of property and casualty insurance and the protection of policyholders, our insurance subsidiaries expect that they will continue to face efforts by those legislatures to expand regulations to address these concerns. Resulting new legislation could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries. In the event of the insolvency, liquidation or other reorganization of any of our insurance subsidiaries, our creditors and stockholders would have no right to proceed against any such insurance subsidiary or to cause the liquidation or bankruptcy of any such insurance subsidiary under federal or state bankruptcy laws. The insurance laws of the domiciliary state would govern such proceedings and the relevant insurance commissioner would act as liquidator or rehabilitator for the insurance subsidiary. Creditors and policyholders of any such insurance subsidiary would be entitled to payment in full from the assets of the insurance subsidiary before we, as a stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distribution. The financial position of our insurance subsidiaries also may be affected by court decisions that expand insurance coverage beyond the intention of the insurer at the time it originally issued an insurance policy. In 2008, the United States Treasury Department issued a report, Blueprint for Financial Regulatory Reform, including recommendations to improve regulatory oversight of the financial services sector. The report includes a proposal that would establish a federal insurance regulatory structure and allow individual insurance companies the option of obtaining a federal charter, similar to the current dual-chartering system for banking. Congress also has pending proposals regarding optional federal chartering of insurance companies and other various insurance-related matters which have been subject to congressional hearings in 2008 and 2009. Due to the volatility in the financial markets which accelerated in the last half of 2008 and continued in 2009, and in particular volatility for companies in the financial services sector, it is possible that additional oversight or regulation could be imposed at the federal and/or state levels. Management will continue to monitor the existing proposals and any new proposals. Additional regulations could adversely affect the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, insurers of similar size and/or the insurance industry as a whole. 36 Table of Contents The insurance industry is highly cyclical. The results of companies in the insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations due to competition, economic conditions, interest rates and other factors. In particular, companies in the property and casualty insurance segment of the industry historically have experienced pricing and profitability cycles. With respect to these cycles, the factors having the greatest impact include significant and/or rapid changes in loss costs, including changes in loss frequency and/or severity; prior approval and restrictions in certain states for price increases; intense price competition; less restrictive underwriting standards; aggressive marketing; and increased advertising, which have resulted in higher industry-wide combined loss and expense ratios. The personal lines insurance and annuity markets are highly competitive and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by competitive forces. We operate in a highly competitive environment and compete with numerous insurance companies, as well as mutual fund families, independent agent companies and financial planners. In some instances and geographic locations, competitors have specifically targeted the educator marketplace with specialized products and programs. We compete in our target market with a number of national providers of personal automobile and homeowners insurance and life insurance and annuities. The insurance industry consists of a large number of insurance companies, some of which have substantially greater financial resources, more diversified product lines, greater economies of scale and/or lower-cost marketing approaches, such as direct marketing, mail, Internet and telemarketing, compared to us. In our target market, we believe that the principal competitive factors in the sale of property and casualty insurance products are price, service, name recognition and education association sponsorships. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the sale of life insurance and annuity products are product features, perceived stability of the insurer, service, name recognition, price and education association sponsorships. Particularly in the property and casualty business, our insurance subsidiaries have experienced, and expect to experience in the future, periods of intense competition during which they may be unable to increase policyholders and revenues without adversely impacting profit margins. The inability of an insurance subsidiary to compete successfully in the property and casualty business would adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations and its resulting ability to distribute cash to us. In our annuity business, the new Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Section 403(b) regulations, which generally took effect January 1, 2009, make the 403(b) market more similar to the 401(k) market than it has been in the past. While this may drive some competitors out of this market, it may make the 403(b) market more attractive to some of the larger 401(k) providers, including both insurance and mutual fund companies, that had not previously been active competitors in this business. The inability of an insurance subsidiary to compete successfully in these markets would adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations and its resulting ability to distribute cash to the holding company. 37 Table of Contents Economic and other factors affecting our niche market could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Horace Manns strategic objective is to become the company of choice in meeting the insurance and financial services needs of the educational community. With K-12 teachers, administrators, and support personnel representing a significant percentage of our business, the financial condition and results of operations of our subsidiaries could be more prone than many of our competitors to the effects of economic forces and other issues affecting the educator market including, but not limited to, state budget deficits and cut-backs and adverse changes in state and local tax revenues. A reduction or elimination of the tax advantages of life and annuity products and/or a change in the tax benefits of various government-authorized retirement programs, such as 403(b) annuities and individual retirement accounts (IRAs), could make our products less attractive to clients and adversely affect our operating results. A significant part of our annuity business involves fixed and variable 403(b) tax-qualified annuities, which are annuities purchased voluntarily by individuals employed by public school systems or other tax-exempt organizations. While the recent changes in IRS regulations governing 403(b) plans did not change the relative tax advantages of 403(b) annuities, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations that do affect the relative tax and other advantages of our life and annuity products to clients or the tax benefits of programs utilized by our clients. As a result of economic conditions in 2008, 2009 and as of the time of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, revenue challenges exist at federal, state and local government levels. These challenges could increase the risk of future adverse impacts on current tax advantaged products. See also Business  Regulation  Regulation at Federal Level. Current federal income tax laws generally permit the tax-deferred accumulation of earnings on the premiums paid by the holders of annuities and life insurance products. Taxes, if any, are payable on income attributable to a distribution under the contract for the year in which the distribution is made. From time to time, Congress has considered legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefit of such deferral of taxation on the accretion of value with life insurance and non-qualified annuity contracts. Enactment of this legislation, including a simplified flat tax income structure with an exemption from taxation for investment income, could result in fewer sales of our life insurance and annuity products. Litigation may harm our financial strength or reduce our profitability. Companies in the insurance industry have been subject to substantial litigation resulting from claims, disputes and other matters. Most recently, they have faced expensive claims, including class action lawsuits, alleging, among other things, improper sales practices and improper claims settlement procedures. Negotiated settlements of certain such actions have had a material adverse effect on many insurance companies. The resolution of such claims against any of our insurance subsidiaries, including the potential adverse effect on our reputation and charges against the earnings of our insurance subsidiaries as a result of legal defense costs, a settlement agreement or an adverse finding or findings against our insurance subsidiaries in such a claim, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries. 38 Table of Contents Data security breaches could have an adverse impact on the Companys business and reputation. Unauthorized access to our client or employee data or other breaches of data security in our facilities, networks or databases, or those of our agents or third-party vendors, could result in loss or theft of data and information or systems interruptions that may expose the Company to liability and/or regulatory action and may have an adverse impact on the Companys clients, employees and business. In addition, any compromise of the security of our data could harm the Companys reputation and business. We have designed, implemented and routinely test industry-compliant procedures for protection of confidential information and sensitive corporate data, including rapid response procedures to help contain or prevent data loss if a breach were to occur. We have also implemented multiple technical security protections and contractual obligations regarding security breaches for our agents and third-party vendors. Even with these efforts, there can be no absolute assurances that security breaches will be prevented. Successful execution of our growth strategy is highly dependent on effective implementation of new technology solutions. Our ability to effectively execute our growth strategy and leverage potential economies of scale is dependent on our ability to provide the requisite technology components of that strategy. While we have effectively upgraded our infrastructure technologies with improvements in our data center, a new communications platform and enhanced disaster recovery capabilities, our ability to build upon this foundation and replace dated, single-function legacy systems with fully functional, flexible, maintainable and user-friendly technology solutions, including current efforts underway to replace major components of our property and casualty administrative system, will be necessary to achieve our plans. The inherent difficulty in implementing large technology solutions, coupled with the Companys lack of experience in these types of endeavors, presents increased risk to delivering these technology solutions in a timely and cost-effective manner. Utilization of third-party vendors can augment the Companys internal capacity for these implementations, but may not reduce the risks of timely and cost effective delivery. Loss of key vendor relationships could affect our operations. We rely on services and products provided by a number of vendors in the United States and abroad. These include, for example, vendors of computer hardware and software and vendors of services such as claim adjustment services, investment management advisement, information technology consulting and employee benefits consulting/actuarial services. In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services, we may suffer operational difficulties and financial losses. In addition, in some instances certain individuals working for vendors have provided services to us for extended periods of time, gaining substantial knowledge of the Company and our operations. The loss of continued service by those individuals could adversely impact our operations. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
