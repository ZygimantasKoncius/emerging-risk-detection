Risk Factors," in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2010, and other filings with the SEC, and are subject to change at any time. Our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement. ITEM 1. BUSINESS - ---------------- OVERVIEW: Competitive Technologies, Inc. ("CTTC"), was incorporated in Delaware in 1971, succeeding an Illinois corporation incorporated in 1968. CTTC and its subsidiaries (collectively, "we," "our," or "us"), provide distribution, patent and technology transfer, sales and licensing services focusing on the needs of our customers, matching those requirements with commercially viable technology or product solutions. We develop relationships with universities, companies, inventors and patent or intellectual property holders to obtain the rights or a license to their intellectual property (collectively, the "technology" or "technologies"), or to their product. They become our clients, for whom we find markets to sell or further develop or distribute their technology or product. We also develop relationships with those who have a need or use for technologies or products. They become our customers, usually through a license or sublicense, or distribution agreement. We earn revenue in three ways, retained royalties from licensing our clients' and our own technologies to our customer licensees, product sales fees in a business model that allows us to share in the profits of distribution of finished products, and sales of inventory. Our customers pay us license fees, royalties based on usage of the technology, or per unit fees, and we share that revenue with our clients. We currently maintain a small inventory of our Calmare pain therapy medical device and we recognize revenue from those sales as devices are shipped to our customers. Our revenue fluctuates due to changes in revenue of our customers, upfront license fees, new licenses granted, new distribution agreements, expiration of existing licenses or agreements, and/or the expiration or economic obsolescence of patents underlying licenses or products. We acquire rights to commercialize a technology or product on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis, worldwide or limited to a specific geographic area. When we license or sublicense those rights to our customers, we may limit rights to a defined field of use. Technologies can be early, mid, or late stage. Products we evaluate must be working prototypes or finished products. We establish channel partners based on forging relationships with mutually aligned goals and matched competencies to deliver solutions that benefit the ultimate end-user. The Company incurred an operating loss for fiscal 2010, as well as an operating loss in fiscal 2009. We continue to seek revenue from new technologies or products to mitigate the concentration of revenues, and replace revenues from expiring licenses. At current reduced spending levels, the Company may not have sufficient cash flow to fund operating expenses beyond third quarter fiscal 2011. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments to reflect the possible future effect of the recoverability and classification of assets or amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its developing other recurring revenue streams sufficient to cover operating costs. If necessary, we will meet anticipated operating cash requirements by further reducing costs, and/or pursuing sales of certain assets and technologies while we pursue licensing and Page 4 distribution opportunities for our remaining portfolio of technologies. The company does not have any significant individual cash or capital requirements in the budget going forward. Failure to develop a recurring revenue stream sufficient to cover operating expenses would negatively affect the Company's financial position. On September 3, 2010, the Company's securities began trading on the OTCQB marketplace under the ticker symbol CTTC, having been delisted from the NYSE Amex (the "Exchange"). The delisting followed an 18-month period during which the Company sought to regain compliance with the Exchange's continued listing standards as set forth in Part 10 of the Exchange Company Guide. As noted in Section 1003 of the Exchange Company Guide, companies with stockholders' equity of less than $2 million, and losses from continuing operations and net losses in two out of its three most recent fiscal years, or with stockholders' equity of less than $4 million and losses from continuing operations and net losses in three out of its four most recent fiscal years are non-compliant. We were only non-compliant with the stockholders' equity component. Despite arguments made at an oral hearing at which the Company sought to remain listed, the Exchange Listing Qualifications Panel affirmed the Exchange Staff's determination to delist the Company's securities. After trading on the OTCQB for a month, on October 5, 2010, the Company's securities began trading on the OTC market's top tier, the OTCQX. PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION SERVICES Our services are beneficial to the inventor, manufacturer and distributor of the product. We evaluate a working prototype or finished product for marketability. We find opportunities through industry connections and contacts, and trade shows. We select products we will represent, negotiate with potential domestic and international distributors, and sign agreements on a country and/or area exclusive basis. We earn revenue on a per-unit basis through product distribution agreements. We share the revenue with the product inventor, and/or manufacturer. TECHNOLOGY COMMERCIALIZATION SERVICES Our services are beneficial to the provider and user of the technology. The technology client can focus on research and development, rather than selling and marketing, as we effectively become their marketing department. The technology customer can focus on selling and marketing, rather than research and development. We maintain and enforce our clients' and our technology patent rights, by monitoring and addressing infringement. We maximize the value of technologies for the benefit of our clients, customers and shareholders. We identify and commercialize innovative technologies in life and physical sciences, electronics, and nano science. Life sciences include medical testing, diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, biotechnologies, medical devices and other medical or biological applications. Physical sciences include chemical, display, and environmental applications. Electronics include communications, semiconductors, Internet related, e-commerce and consumer electronics applications. Nanotechnologies are the manipulation of microscopic particles into useful arrangements, and smart or novel materials; a nano particle is one thousand times smaller than the width of a human hair. We have technologies in each area, with a concentration in life sciences. PORTFOLIO ACQUISITION We continue to expand relationships with universities and inventors, increasing the number of clients, products and technologies we represent, and establishing us as the premier technology commercialization and product distribution company. The goal is to have a pipeline of technologies and distribution products that will generate a long-term recurring revenue stream. We evaluate potential technologies based on the strength of the intellectual property, our ability to protect it, its life stage, further development time needed, compatibility with existing technology in our portfolio, marketability, market size, and potential profitability. We evaluate potential products for distribution based on their capability to fulfill an unmet market need and/or social responsibility. We focus on products that improve quality-of-life. The goal is to acquire products for Page 5 distribution that have a competitive advantage, proprietary know-how and/or regulatory approval. We seek exclusive rights to manufacture, market and distribute the products. Numerous technologies and products are reviewed and evaluated in terms of current, mid- and long-term revenue potential. Both products and technologies have the potential to produce different levels of revenue throughout the life of the agreement. We obtain rights to improvements and/or refinements that extend the life of the product or technology, increasing the potential revenue. We continuously review the revenue potential of our product and technology portfolio to generate a long-term recurring revenue stream. A non-disclosure agreement signed with a prospective client allows us access to confidential information about the product or technology. We require similar non-disclosure agreements from prospective customers when we commercialize the product or technology. We include mutual non-disclosure provisions about the product or technology in agreements granted to protect value, for CTTC, our clients and our customers. As a result of these obligations, as well as federal regulations for disclosure of confidential information, we may only be able to disclose limited information about licenses and sublicenses granted for products or technologies we evaluate, as is necessary for an understanding of our financial results. MARKETING TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS We commercialize technologies and products through contacts in research and development, legal firms, major corporations, seminars and trade shows. We determine the most likely users of the technologies or distributors of products, and contact prospective customers. TECHNOLOGY PROTECTION AND LITIGATION Protecting our technologies from unintentional and willful patent infringement, domestically and internationally, is an important part of our business. We sometimes assist in preparation of initial patent applications, and often are responsible for prosecuting and maintaining patents. Unintentional infringement, where the infringer usually does not know that a patent exists, can often be resolved by the granting of a license. In cases of willful infringement, certain infringers will continue to infringe absent legal action, or, companies may successfully find work-arounds to avoid paying proper monies to us and our clients for use of our technologies. We defend our technologies on behalf of ourselves, our clients and licensees, and pursue patent infringement cases through litigation, if necessary. Such cases, even if settled out of court, may take several years to resolve, with expenses borne by our clients, us, or shared. Proceeds from the case are usually shared in proportion to the costs. As a result, we may incur significant expenses in some years and be reimbursed through proceeds of awards or settlements several years later. In cases of willful infringement, patent law provides for the potential of treble damages at the discretion of the Court. REVENUE GENERATION We license technologies to generate revenue based on usage or sales of the technologies, or by sharing in the profits of distribution. When our customers pay us, we share the revenue with our clients. Product distribution We have established a new business model for appropriate technologies that allows us to move beyond our usual royalty arrangement and share in the profits of distribution. Distribution terms are set in written agreements for products, and are generally signed for exclusive area parameters. We currently maintain a small inventory of our Calmare pain therapy medical device and we recognize revenue from the sale of inventory as devices are shipped to our customers. In late fiscal 2007, we obtained exclusive worldwide distribution rights to a non-invasive pain therapy device for rapid treatment of high-intensity oncologic and neuropathic pain, including pain resistant to morphine and other drugs. Developed and patented in Italy by CTTC's client, Prof. Giuseppe Marineo, DSc., the "Scrambler Therapy" technology was brought to CTTC through the efforts of Prof. Giancarlo Elia Valori of the Italian business development group, Sviluppo Lazio S.p.A. The Calmare(R) pain therapy medical device, with a biophysical rather than a biochemical approach, uses a multi-processor able to simultaneously treat multiple pain areas by applying surface electrodes to the skin. The device's European CE mark certification allows it to be distributed and sold Page 6 throughout Europe, and makes it eligible for approval for distribution and sales in multiple global markets. In February 2009, CTTC received FDA 510(k) clearance for U.S. sales of the device. Several thousand patients in various hospitals and medical centers have been successfully treated using the technology. CTTC's partner, GEOMC Co., Ltd. of Korea, is manufacturing the product commercially for worldwide distribution. U.S. and international patents are pending. Beginning in fiscal 2008, we entered into a number of distribution agreements granting country-exclusive rights to a number of international distributors. Each distributor is required to obtain local sales authorization. Ongoing sales from these distribution agreements are anticipated in fiscal 2011 and into the future. In the U.S. we are the distributor for the Calmare Pain Therapy medical device, having canceled the July 2009 distribution agreement we had with Innovative Medical Therapies, Inc. for nonperformance, and currently have contracts with approximately 30 commissioned sales representatives. To assist potential clients, we are working with several commercial leasing companies to provide long term (24-60 months) financing for sales of the Calmare device to hospitals, clinics and medical practices in the US. Ongoing sales in the US, facilitated by these commissioned representatives, are anticipated in fiscal 2011 and into the future. Technology royalties Client and customer agreements are generally for the duration of the technology life, which usually is determined by applicable patent law. When we receive customer reports of sales or payments, whichever occurs first, we record revenue for our portion, and record our obligation to our clients for their portion. For early stage technologies that may not be ready for commercial development without further research, we may receive annual minimum payments and/or milestone payments based on research progress or subsequent sublicense or joint venture proceeds. In certain sublicense or license agreements, we may receive an upfront fee upon execution of the license. Our fees are generally non-refundable, and, except for annual minimums, are usually not creditable against future royalties. In certain cases, the first year or several years' royalties may be waived in consideration for an upfront fee. We may apply the upfront fee or initial fees to reimburse patent prosecution and/or maintenance costs incurred by either party. In these cases, payments are recorded as a reduction of expense, and not as revenue. If the reimbursement belongs solely to our client, we record no revenue or expense. As a result, a new technology may not generate significant revenue in its early years. Licensing terms are documented in written agreements with customers. We generally enter into single element agreements with customers, under which we have no additional obligations other than patent prosecution and maintenance. We may enter into multiple element agreements under which we have continuing service obligations. All revenue from multiple element agreements is deferred until delivery of all verifiable required elements. In milestone billing agreements we recognize non-refundable, upfront fees ratably over the life of the agreement, and milestone payments as the specified milestone is achieved. We evaluate billing agreements on a case-by-case basis, and record revenue as appropriate. We do not have multiple element or milestone billing agreements at this time, but have had such agreements in the past, and could have in the future. In fiscal 2010, we had a significant concentration of revenue from our Calmare pain therapy medical device. We actively market other technologies, and seek new technologies to mitigate this concentration of revenue and provide a steady future revenue stream. We have created a new business model for appropriate technologies that allows us to move beyond our usual royalty arrangement and share in the profits of distribution. We currently maintain a small inventory of our Calmare pain therapy medical device and we recognize revenue from the sale of inventory as devices are shipped to our customers. Technologies that produced revenue equal to or exceeding 15% of our total revenue, or at least $250,000 in 2010 and 2009 were: 2010 2009 ---------- -------- Pain therapy medical device $1,941,000 $ 7,000 Plant Regeneration $ 12,000 $132,000 Flip Chip $ - $ 71,000 Page 7 As a percentage of total revenue for the same periods, these technologies represented: 2010 2009 ----- ----- Pain therapy medical device 97% 2% Plant Regeneration 1% 38% Flip Chip -% 20% Our pain therapy device is a non-invasive pain therapy device for rapid treatment of high-intensity oncologic and neuropathic pain, including pain resistant to morphine and other drugs. We received FDA 510(k) clearance for the device in February 2009 and have been ramping up our sales effort ever since. We expect the revenue generated from this technology to grow significantly in future years. Revenue for fiscal 2010 primarily represented the sale of devices to either international distributors or end users in the United States. It also includes rental income from situations where we rented the device to end-users in the United States and Gain from the Sale of Rental Assets when these devices were converted to outright sales. The plant regeneration technology has been assigned to the University of Pennsylvania who pays us a royalty on any income earned from exploiting this technology. The technology is currently exclusively licensed to Syngenta Biotechnology, Inc. The revenue for fiscal 2009 represented previously unreported back royalties. We expect our future revenue stream to more closely resemble revenue received in fiscal 2010. The revenue from our Flip Chip technology in fiscal 2009 represented the outright sale of the patents to a third party. As such we will not generate any further revenue from this technology in the future. We receive revenue from legal awards that result from successful patent enforcement actions and/or out of court settlements. Such awards or settlements may be significant, are non-recurring and may include punitive damages, attorneys' fees, court costs and interest. Other technologies in our life sciences portfolio, many of which are subject to testing, clinical trials and approvals, include: - - Nanotechnology bone cement biomaterial with a broad range of potential applications, including dental, spinal and other bone related applications. Exclusively licensed to Soteira, Inc. for human spinal applications; - - Sunless tanning agent, a skin-pigment enhancer being researched as a skin cancer preventative, and therapeutic for vitiligo, albinism and psoriasis, exclusively licensed to Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (Australia); - - Lupus Diagnostic and Monitoring technology, a cost-effective scalable testing platform used to detect and monitor the autoimmune disease, Lupus; - - Sexual Dysfunction technology, CTTC's joint venture with Xion Corporation announced in September 2009 is conducting an extended research program in support of the commercialization of our patented melanocortin analogues for treating male and female sexual dysfunction and obesity. Our applied science/electronics portfolio includes: - - Encryption technology that operates at high speeds with low memory requirements to secure applications used on the Internet, telecommunications, smart cards and e-commerce; - - Video and audio signal processing technology licensed in the Motion Picture Electronics Group visual patent portfolio pool (MPEG 4 Visual), and used in streaming video products for personal computers and wireless devices, including mobile phones; Page 8 - - Radio Alert Warning System, a low powered dual-mode transmitter capable of short-range interruption of commercial radio broadcasting with a message alerting of an emergency situation; - - Structural Steel Fissure Detection Paint contains a built-in, self-activating, crack-indicating or warning capability effective coincident with application of the paint to the structure, and requiring minimum training for its use. REVENUE FROM FOREIGN SOURCES Revenue from foreign sources totaled approximately $1,385,000 and $43,000, in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of the foreign sourced revenue received, $1,339,000 in fiscal 2010 was from sources in Italy and $32,000, in fiscal 2009 was from sources in Japan. INVESTMENTS From time to time we provide other forms of assistance and funding to certain development-stage companies to further develop specific technologies. EMPLOYEES As of October 25, 2010, we employed the full-time equivalent of 8 people. We also had independent consultants under contract to provide business development services. In addition to the diverse technical, intellectual property, legal, financial, marketing and business expertise of our professional team, from time to time we rely on advice from outside specialists to fulfill unique technology needs.

FISCAL YEAR Our fiscal year ends July 31, and our first, second, third and fourth quarters end October 31, January 31, April 30 and July 31, respectively. Page 9 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - --------------------- RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT The risk factors described below are not all-inclusive. All risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business, results of operations, and financial position. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements or risk factors. There may be other risks and uncertainties not highlighted herein that may affect our financial condition and business operations. WE DERIVED MORE THAN 97% OF OUR REVENUE IN FISCAL 2010 FROM ONE TECHNOLOGY. We derived approximately $1,941,000, or 97%, of 2010 revenue from our pain therapy medical device technology. A concentration of revenue makes our operations vulnerable to patent change or expiration, or to the development of new and competing technologies and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial position. IN THE LAST FIVE FISCAL YEARS, WE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT NET LOSSES AND NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS, AND OUR ABILITY TO FINANCE FUTURE LOSSES IS LIMITED, AND MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. The table below summarizes our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the five years ended July 31, 2010: 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ Net income (loss) $(2,708,534) $(3,479,824) $(5,966,454) $(8,893,946) $(2,377,224) Net cash flows from: Operating activities (3,662,070) (3,491,630) (4,994,411) (5,437,443) (3,527,318) Investing activities 65,287 (1,490) 792,539 (978,217) (141,644) Financing activities 3,752,196 2,008,096 (133,109) 78,425 2,298,726 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 155,413 $(1,485,024) $(4,334,981) $(6,337,235) $(1,370,236) The Company has incurred operating losses since fiscal 2006. At current reduced spending levels, the Company may not have sufficient cash flow to fund operating expenses beyond third quarter fiscal 2011. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments to reflect the possible future effect of the recoverability and classification of assets or amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its developing other recurring revenue streams sufficient to cover operating costs. If necessary, we will meet anticipated operating cash requirements by further reducing costs, and/or pursuing sales of certain assets and technologies while we pursue licensing and distribution opportunities for our remaining portfolio of technologies. The company does not have any significant individual cash or capital requirements in the budget going forward. Failure to develop a recurring revenue stream sufficient to cover operating expenses would negatively affect the Company's financial position. Our current recurring revenue stream is insufficient for us to be profitable with our present cost structure. To return to and sustain profitability, we must increase recurring revenue by successfully licensing technologies with current and long-term revenue streams, and continue to build our portfolio of innovative technologies. We significantly reduced overhead costs with staff reductions across all company departments, reduced extraneous litigations, and obtained new technologies to build revenue. We will continue to monitor our cost structure, and expect to operate within our generated revenue and cash balances. Future revenue, obtaining rights to new technologies, granting licenses, and enforcing intellectual property rights are subject to many factors beyond our control. These include technological changes, economic cycles, and our licensees' ability to successfully commercialize our technologies. Consequently, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to be profitable. Although we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts, we Page 10 believe the combination of our cash on hand, and revenue from successfully executing our strategy will be sufficient to meet our obligations of current and anticipated operating cash requirements. WE DEPEND ON RELATIONSHIPS WITH INVENTORS TO GAIN ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND INVENTIONS. IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS OR TO DEVELOP NEW RELATIONSHIPS, WE MAY HAVE FEWER TECHNOLOGIES AND INVENTIONS AVAILABLE TO GENERATE REVENUE. TECHNOLOGY CAN CHANGE RAPIDLY AND INDUSTRY STANDARDS CONTINUALLY EVOLVE, OFTEN MAKING PRODUCTS OBSOLETE, OR RESULTING IN SHORT PRODUCT LIFECYCLES. OUR PROFITABILITY DEPENDS ON OUR LICENSEES' ABILITY TO ADAPT TO SUCH CHANGES. We do not invent new technologies or products. We depend on relationships with universities, corporations, government agencies, research institutions, inventors, and others to provide technology-based opportunities that can develop into profitable licenses, and/or allow us to share in the profits of distribution. Failure to maintain or develop relationships could adversely affect operating results and financial conditions. We are dependent upon our clients' abilities to develop new technologies, introduce new products, and adapt to technology and economic changes. We cannot be certain that current or new relationships will provide the volume or quality of technologies necessary to sustain our business. In some cases, universities and other technology sources may compete against us as they seek to develop and commercialize technologies. Universities may receive financing for basic research in exchange for the exclusive right to commercialize resulting inventions. These and other strategies may reduce the number of technology sources, potential clients, to whom we can market our services. If we are unable to secure new sources of technology, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. WE RECEIVE MOST OF OUR REVENUE FROM CUSTOMERS OVER WHOM WE HAVE NO CONTROL. We rely on our customers for revenue. Development of new products utilizing our technology involves risk. Many technologies do not become commercially profitable products despite extensive development efforts. Our license agreements do not require customers to advise us of problems they encounter in development of commercial products, and usually treat such information as confidential. Their failure to resolve problems may result in a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. STRONG COMPETITION WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY MAY REDUCE OUR CLIENT BASE. We compete with universities, law firms, venture capital firms and other technology commercialization firms. Many organizations offer some aspect of technology transfer services, and are well established with more financial and human resources than we provide. This market is highly fragmented and participants frequently focus on a specific technology area. FROM TIME-TO-TIME WE ARE INVOLVED IN LAWSUITS THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE INVOLVED SIGNIFICANT LEGAL EXPENSES. IF THE COURTS OR REGULATORY AGENCIES IN THESE SUITS OR ACTIONS DECIDE AGAINST US, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. For a complete description of all lawsuits in which we are currently involved, see ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OUR REVENUE GROWTH DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS OF OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR MARKETS. IF WE FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THEIR TECHNOLOGY NEEDS OR MARKETS, WE LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MEET THOSE NEEDS AND GENERATE REVENUES. By focusing on the technology needs of our customers, we are better positioned to generate revenue by providing technology solutions. The market demands of our customers drive our revenue. The better we understand their markets, the better we are able to identify and obtain effective technology solutions for our customers. We rely on our professional staff and contract business development consultants to understand our customers' technical, commercial, and market requirements and constraints, to identify and obtain effective technology solutions for them. Page 11 OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL. Our success depends on the knowledge, efforts and abilities of a small number of key personnel, including Johnnie D. Johnson, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Aris Despo, Executive Vice President, Business Development. We rely on our professional staff and contract business development consultants to identify intellectual property opportunities and technology solutions, and to negotiate and close license agreements. Competition for personnel with the necessary range and depth of experience is intense. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain highly qualified professionals and consultants, especially with our small number of staff, our revenue, financial condition and future activities could be materially adversely affected. OUR CUSTOMERS, AND WE, DEPEND ON GOVERNMENT APPROVALS TO COMMERCIALLY DEVELOP CERTAIN LICENSED PRODUCTS. Commercial development of some licensed patents may require the approval of foreign or domestic governmental regulatory agencies, especially in the life sciences area, and there is no assurance that those agencies will grant such approvals. In the United States, the principal governmental agency involved is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). The FDA's approval process is rigorous, time consuming and costly. Until a licensee obtains approval for a product requiring such approval, the licensee may not sell the product in the U.S., and therefore we will not receive revenue based on U.S. sales. IF WE, AND OUR CLIENTS, ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY UNDERLYING OUR LICENSES, OR TO ENFORCE OUR PATENTS ADEQUATELY, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO DEVELOP SUCH LICENSED PATENTS OR TECHNOLOGIES SUCCESSFULLY. License revenue is subject to the risk that issued patents may be declared invalid, may not be issued upon application, or that competitors may circumvent or infringe our licensed patents rendering them commercially inadequate. When all patents underlying a license expire, our revenue from that license ceases, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to replace it with revenue from new or existing licenses. PATENT LITIGATION HAS INCREASED; IT CAN BE EXPENSIVE, AND MAY DELAY OR PREVENT OUR CUSTOMERS' PRODUCTS FROM ENTERING THE MARKET. Our clients and/or we may pursue patent infringement litigation or interference proceedings against holders of conflicting patents or sellers of competing products that we believe infringe our patent rights. For a description of proceedings in which we are currently involved, see ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. We cannot be certain that our clients and/or we will be successful in any litigation or proceeding. The costs and outcome may materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, AND CREATING EFFECTIVE COMMERCIALIZATION STRATEGIES FOR TECHNOLOGIES ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT RISKS THAT INCLUDE UNANTICIPATED DELAYS, UNRECOVERABLE EXPENSES, TECHNICAL PROBLEM, AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT DEVELOPMENT FUNDS WILL BE INSUFFICIENT. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE RISKS COULD CAUSE US TO ABANDON OR SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGE OUR TECHNOLOGY COMMERCIALIZATION STRATEGY. Our success depends upon, among other factors, our clients' ability to develop new or improved technologies, and our customers' products meeting targeted cost and performance objectives for large-scale production, adapting technologies to satisfy industry standards and consumer expectations and needs, and bringing the product to market before saturation. They may encounter unanticipated problems that result in increased costs or substantial delays in the product launch. Products may not be reliable or durable under actual operating conditions, or commercially viable and competitive. They may not meet price or other performance objectives when introduced into the marketplace. Any of these events may adversely affect our realization of revenue from new products. Page 12 WE HAVE NOT PAID DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. We have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since 1981, and, our Board of Directors does not currently have plans to declare or pay cash dividends in the future. The decision to pay dividends is solely at the discretion of our Board of Directors based upon factors that they deem relevant, and may change at any time. IN DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS WE ARE AFFECTED BY PATENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. Patent laws and regulations are continuously reviewed for possible revision. We cannot be certain how we will be affected by revisions. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS - ---------------------------------- None.
