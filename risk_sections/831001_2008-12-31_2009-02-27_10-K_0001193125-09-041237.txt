RISK FACTORS Disruptions in the global financial markets have affected, and may continue to adversely affect, Citigroups business and results of operations. Dramatic declines in the housing market during 2008, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks. These write-downs, initially of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivatives, have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital and to merge with other financial institutions. Disruptions in the global financial markets have also adversely affected the corporate bond markets, debt and equity underwriting and other elements of the financial markets. Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, some lenders and institutional investors have reduced and, in some cases, ceased to provide funding to certain borrowers, including other financial institutions. The impact on available credit (even where Citigroup and other TARP participants are making credit available), increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, Citigroups businesses, capital, liquidity or other financial condition and results of operations, access to credit and the trading price of Citigroup common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. Market disruptions may increase the risk of customer or counterparty delinquency or default. The current market and economic disruptions have affected, and may continue to affect, consumer confidence levels, consumer spending, personal bankruptcy rates and home prices, among other factors, which provide a greater likelihood that more of Citigroups customers or counterparties could use credit cards less frequently or become delinquent in their loans or other obligations to Citigroup. This, in turn, could result in a higher level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, all of which could adversely affect Citigroups earnings. Policies of the Federal Reserve Board or other governmental institutions can also adversely affect Citigroups customers or counterparties, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Additionally, Citigroup may incur significant credit risk exposure which may arise, for example, from entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties have long-term obligations to make payments to the Company. Recent market conditions, including decreased liquidity and pricing transparency along with increased market volatility, have negatively impacted Citigroups credit risk exposure. Although Citigroup regularly reviews its credit exposures, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. Citigroup may experience further write-downs of its financial instruments and other losses related to volatile and illiquid market conditions. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the credit markets have made it extremely difficult to value certain of Citigroups assets. Subsequent valuations, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the values of these assets in future periods. In addition, at the time of any sales of these assets, the price Citigroup ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could require Citigroup to take further write-downs in respect of these assets, which may have an adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial condition in future periods. In addition, Citigroup finances and acquires principal positions in a number of real estate and real estate-related products for its own account, for investment vehicles managed by affiliates in which it also may have a significant investment, for separate accounts managed by affiliates and for major participants in the commercial and residential real estate markets, and originates loans secured by commercial and residential properties. Citigroup also securitizes and trades in a wide range of commercial and residential real estate and real estate-related whole loans, mortgages and other real estate and commercial assets and products, including residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. These businesses have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the downturn in the real estate sector. Furthermore, in the past, Citigroup has provided financial support to certain of its investment products and vehicles in difficult market conditions and, Citigroup may decide to do so again in the future for contractual reasons or, at its discretion, for reputational or business reasons, including through equity investments or cash infusions. Liquidity is essential to Citigroups businesses, and Citigroup relies on external sources, including governmental agencies, to finance a significant portion of its operations. Adequate liquidity is essential to Citigroups businesses. The Companys liquidity could be materially adversely affected by factors Citigroup cannot control, such as the continued general disruption of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry in general. In addition, Citigroups ability to raise funding could be impaired if lenders develop a negative perception of the Companys short-term or long-term financial prospects, or a perception that the Company is experiencing greater liquidity risk. Recent regulatory measures, such as the FDICs temporary guarantee of the newly issued senior debt as well as deposits in non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts, and the commercial paper funding facility of the Federal Reserve Board, are designed to stabilize the financial markets and the liquidity position of financial institutions such as Citigroup. While much of Citigroups recent long-term unsecured funding has been issued pursuant to these government-sponsored funding programs implemented, it is unclear whether, or for how long, these facilities will be extended and what impact termination of any of these facilities could have on Citigroups ability to access funding in the future. It is also unclear when Citigroup will be able to regain access to the public long-term unsecured debt markets on historically customary terms. Further, Citigroups cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly related to its credit spreads in both the cash bond and derivatives markets. Increases in Citigroups credit qualifying spreads can significantly increase the cost of this funding. Credit spreads are influenced by market perceptions of Citigroups creditworthiness and may be influenced by movements in the costs to purchasers of credit default swaps referenced to Citigroups long-term debt. Citigroups credit ratings are also important to its liquidity. A reduction in Citigroups credit ratings could adversely affect its liquidity, widen its credit spreads or otherwise increase its borrowing costs, limit its access to the 47 Table of Contents capital markets or trigger obligations under certain bilateral provisions in some of the Companys trading and collateralized financing contracts. In addition, under these provisions, counterparties could be permitted to terminate certain contracts with Citigroup or require the Company to post additional collateral. Termination of the Companys trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause Citigroup to sustain losses and impair its liquidity by requiring Citigroup to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities transfers. Recently enacted legislation authorizing the U.S. government to take direct action within the financial services industry, and other legislation and regulation currently under consideration, may not stabilize the U.S. financial system in the near term. On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) was signed into law. In addition, on February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed by President Obama. The purpose of these U.S. government actions is to stabilize and provide liquidity to the U.S. financial markets and jumpstart the U.S. economy. The U.S. government is currently considering, and may consider in the future, additional legislation and regulations with similar purposes. The EESA, ARRA and other governmental programs may not have their intended impact of stabilizing, providing liquidity to or restoring confidence in the financial markets. Further, the discontinuation and/or expiration of these or other governmental programs could result in a worsening of current market conditions. Citigroup may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the proposed realignment of its businesses. On January 16, 2009, Citigroup announced that it would realign into two businesses, Citicorp and Citi Holdings, for management and reporting purposes, effective second quarter of 2009. The realignment is part of Citigroups strategy to focus on its core businesses, reduce its balance sheet and simplify its assets. Citigroup believes this structure will allow it to enhance the capabilities and performance of Citigroups core assets, through Citicorp, as well as realize value from its non-core assets, through Citi Holdings. Citi Holdings will also include Citigroups 49% interest in the recently announced Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture, a transaction which is also intended to simplify and streamline the Company on a going-forward basis. Despite these efforts, given the rapidly changing and uncertain financial environment, there can be no assurance that the realignment of Citigroups businesses will achieve the Companys desired objectives or benefits. Future issuance of Citigroup common stock and preferred stock may reduce any earnings available to common stockholders and the return on the Companys equity. During 2008, Citigroup raised a total of approximately $77.3 billion in private and public offerings of preferred and common stock and warrants to purchase common stock, including issuances to the U.S. government under TARP. While this additional capital provides further funding to Citigroups businesses and has improved the Companys financial position, it has increased the Companys equity and the number of actual and diluted shares of Citigroup common stock. On February 27, 2009, Citigroup announced an exchange offer of its common stock for up to $27.5 billion of its existing preferred securities and trust preferred securities. The U.S. government will match this exchange up to a maximum of $25 billion of its preferred stock. These transactions will significantly dilute the existing common stockholders of the Company. In addition, such increases in the outstanding shares of common stock reduce the Companys earnings per share and the return on the Companys equity, unless the Companys earnings increase correspondingly. Further, any additional future U.S. governmental requirements or programs could result in or require additional equity issuances, which further dilute the existing common stockholders and any earnings available to the common stockholders. The elimination of QSPEs from the guidance in SFAS 140 and changes in FIN 46(R) may significantly impact Citigroups consolidated financial statements. The FASB has issued an Exposure Draft of a proposed standard that would eliminate qualified SPEs (QSPEs) from the guidance in SFAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, and a separate Exposure Draft of a proposed standard that proposes three key changes to the consolidation model in FIN 46(R). Such changes include the following: (i) former QSPEs would be included in the scope of FIN 46(R); (ii) FIN 46(R) would be amended to change the method of analyzing which party to a variable interest entity (VIE) should consolidate the VIE to a qualitative determination of power combined with benefits and losses; and (iii) the analysis of primary beneficiaries would have to be reevaluated whenever circumstances change. While these proposed standards have not been finalized, they may have a significant impact on Citigroups consolidated financial statements as the Company may lose sales treatment for assets previously sold to a QSPE, as well as for future sales, and for transfers of a portion of an asset, and the Company will be required to bring a portion of assets that are not currently on its balance sheet onto its balance sheet. For a further discussion on SFAS 140, see Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates on page 18 and Capital Resources and LiquidityOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsElimination of QSPEs and Changes in the FIN 46(R) Consolidation Model on page 104. Citigroups financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates, which, if wrong, could cause unexpected losses in the future. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, Citigroup is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigations and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If assumptions or estimates underlying Citigroups financial statements are incorrect, Citigroup may experience material losses. For example, Citigroup makes judgments in connection with its consolidation analysis of its SPEs. If it is later determined that non-consolidated SPEs should be consolidated, this could adversely affect Citigroups consolidated balance sheet, related funding requirements and capital ratios, and, if the SPE assets include unrealized losses, could require Citigroup to recognize those losses see Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates on page 18. Changes in accounting standards can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how Citigroup records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. Citigroups accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. From 48 Table of Contents time to time, the FASB changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Companys financial statements (e.g., see for example The elimination of QSPEs from the guidance in SFAS 140 and changes in FIN 46(R) may significantly impact Citigroups Consolidated Financial Statements on page 48). These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how Citigroup records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. Defaults by another large financial institution could adversely affect Citigroup and the financial markets generally. The commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships between institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges with which Citigroup interacts on a daily basis and, therefore, could adversely affect the Company. Citigroup may incur significant losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies and concentration of risk increases the potential for such losses. Citigroup seeks to monitor and control its risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. While Citigroup employs a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques (see Managing Global Risk on page 51), those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in all market environments or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Recent market conditions, particularly during the latter part of 2007 and 2008, have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk. These market movements can, and have, limited the effectiveness of Citigroups hedging strategies and have caused the Company to incur significant losses, and they may do so again in the future. In addition, concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in certain of Citigroups businesses. For example, Citigroup extends large commitments as part of its credit origination activities. Citigroups inability to reduce its credit risk by selling, syndicating or securitizing these positions, including during periods of market dislocation, could negatively affect its results of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the positions, as well as the loss of revenues associated with selling such securities or loans. In addition, the Company routinely executes a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks and investment funds. This has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to this industry. Citigroups businesses are subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world. As a participant in the financial services industry, Citigroup is subject to extensive regulation, including fiscal and monetary policies, in jurisdictions around the world. For example, the actions of the Federal Reserve Board and international central banking authorities directly impact Citigroups cost of funds for lending, capital raising and investment activities and may impact the value of financial instruments the Company holds. This level of regulation is expected to increase significantly in all jurisdictions in which the Company conducts business in response to the current financial crisis. Among other things, Citigroup could be fined, prohibited from engaging in some of its business activities or subject to limitations or conditions on its business activities, including increased capital or liquidity requirements, each of which could lead to reputational harm. The financial services industry faces substantial legal liability and regulatory risks, and Citigroup may face damage to its reputation and legal liability. Citigroup faces significant legal risks in its businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Citigroups experience has been that legal claims by customers and clients increase in a market downturn. In addition, employment-related claims typically increase in periods when Citigroup has reduced the total number of employees, such as during the last fiscal year. In addition, there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years, and Citigroup runs the risk that employee misconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the extensive precautions Citigroup takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Citigroups businesses may be materially adversely affected if it is unable to hire and retain qualified employees. Citigroups performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. The Companys continued ability to compete effectively in its businesses, to manage its businesses effectively and to expand into new businesses and geographic regions depends on the Companys ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate its existing employees. Competition from within the financial services industry and from businesses outside of the financial services industry for qualified employees has often been intense. This is particularly the case in emerging markets, where Citigroup is often competing for qualified employees with entities that have a significantly greater presence or more extensive experience in the region. In addition, in 2008 the market price of Citigroup common stock declined significantly during the year. A substantial portion of the Companys annual bonus compensation paid to its senior employees has been paid in the form of equity, meaning that such awards are not as valuable from a compensatory or retention perspective. Moreover, Citigroup is subject to certain significant compensation restrictions applicable to a broad group of its senior management as a result of its receipt of TARP funding in December 2008 as well as other recently-adopted governmental programs and legislation. Such restrictions include restricted executive incentives, deferral of some executive compensation, equity awards with performance-vesting features, clawback provisions and elimination or restriction of severance pay to senior executives. 49 Table of Contents These restrictions, alone or in combination with the other factors described above, could adversely affect Citigroups ability to hire and retain qualified employees. A failure in Citigroups operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair the Companys liquidity, disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage Citigroups reputation and cause losses. Citigroups businesses are highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. These transactions, as well as the information technology services Citigroup provides to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. Due to the breadth of Citigroups client base and its geographical reach, developing and maintaining the Companys operational systems and infrastructure has become increasingly challenging. Citigroups financial, account, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond the Companys control, such as a spike in transaction volume or unforeseen catastrophic events, adversely affecting the Companys ability to process these transactions or provide these services. Citigroup also faces the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries Citigroup uses to facilitate its transactions, and as Citigroups interconnectivity with its clients grows, the Company increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to its clients systems. Implementation of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture may, at least temporarily, exacerbate these risks insofar as the activities of the joint venture are concerned. In addition, Citigroups operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks. Although Citigroup takes protective measures and endeavors to modify them as circumstances warrant, its computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. Given the high volume of transactions at Citigroup, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified. If one or more of such events occurs, this could potentially jeopardize Citigroups, its clients, counterparties or third parties confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, the Companys computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in Citigroups, its clients, its counterparties or third parties operations, which could result in significant losses or reputational damage. 50 Table of Contents MANAGING GLOBAL RISK RISK MANAGEMENT The Company believes that effective risk management is of primary importance to its success. Accordingly, the Company has a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. These risks include credit, market liquidity and operational, including legal and reputational exposures. Citigroups risk management framework is designed to balance corporate oversight with well-defined independent risk management functions. Enhancements were made to the risk management framework throughout 2008 based on guiding principles established by the Chief Risk Officer:  a common Risk Capital model to evaluate risks;  a defined risk appetite, aligned with business strategy;  accountability through a common framework to manage risks;  risk decisions based on transparent, accurate and rigorous analytics;  expertise, stature, authority and independence of Risk Managers; and  empowering Risk Managers to make decisions and escalate issues. Significant focus has been placed on fostering a risk culture based on a policy of Taking Intelligent Risk with Shared Responsibility, without forsaking Individual Accountability.  Taking intelligent risk means that Citi must carefully identify, measure and aggregate risks, and must fully understand downside risks.  Shared responsibility means that individuals own and influence business outcomes, including risk controls.  Individual accountability means individuals held ourselves accountable to actively manage risk. The Chief Risk Officer, working closely with the Citi CEO, established management committees, Citis Audit and Risk Management Committee and Citis Board of Directors, is responsible for:  establishing core standards for the management, measurement and reporting of risk;  identifying, assessing, communicating and monitoring risks on a company-wide basis;  engaging with senior management and the Board of Directors on a frequent basis on material matters with respect to risk-taking activities in the businesses and related risk management processes; and  ensuring that the risk function has adequate independence, authority, expertise, staffing, technology and resources. Changes were made to the risk management organization in 2008 to facilitate the management of risk across three dimensions: businesses, regions and critical products. Each of the major business groups has a Business Chief Risk Officer who is the focal point for risk decisions (such as setting risk limits or approving transactions) in the business. There are also Regional Chief Risk Officers, accountable for the risks in their geographic area, and who are the primary risk contact for the regional business heads and local regulators. In addition, the position of Product Chief Risk Officers was created for those areas of critical importance to Citigroup such as real estate, structured credit products and fundamental credit. The Product Risk Officers are accountable for the risks within their specialty and they focus on problem areas across businesses and regions. The Product Risk Officers serve as a resource to the Chief Risk Officer, as well as to the Business and Regional Chief Risk Officers, to better enable the Business and Regional Chief Risk Officers to focus on the day-to-day management of risks and responsiveness to business flow. In addition to changing the risk management organization to facilitate the management of risk across these three dimensions, the risk organization also includes the newly-created Business Management team to ensure that the risk organization has the appropriate infrastructure, processes and management reporting. This team includes:  the risk capital group, which continues to enhance the risk capital model and ensure that it is consistent across all our business activities;  the risk architecture group, which ensures we have integrated systems and common metrics, and thereby allows us to aggregate and stress test exposures across the institution;  the infrastructure risk group, which focuses on improving our operational processes across businesses and regions; and  the office of the Chief Administrative Officer, which focuses on re-engineering risk communications and relationships, including our critical regulatory relationships. RISK AGGREGATION AND STRESS TESTING While the major risk areas are described individually on the following pages, these risks often need to be reviewed and managed in conjunction with one another and across the various businesses. The Chief Risk Officer, as noted above, monitors and controls major risk exposures and concentrations across the organization. This means aggregating risks, within and across businesses, as well as subjecting those risks to alternative stress scenarios in order to assess the potential economic impact they may have on the Company. During 2008, comprehensive stress tests were implemented across Citi for mark-to-market, available-for-sale, and accrual portfolios. These firm-wide stress reports measure the potential impact to the Company and its component businesses of very large changes in various types of key risk factors (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads), as well as the potential impact of a number of historical and hypothetical forward-looking systemic stress scenarios. Supplementing the stress testing described above, Risk Management, working with input from the businesses and Finance, provides enhanced periodic updates to senior management and the Board of Directors on significant potential exposures across Citigroup arising from risk concentrations (e.g., residential real estate), financial market participants 51 Table of Contents (e.g., monoline insurers), and other systemic issues (e.g., commercial paper markets). These risk assessments are forward-looking exercises, intended to inform senior management and the Board of Directors about the potential economic impacts to Citi that may occur, directly or indirectly, as a result of hypothetical scenarios, based on judgmental analysis from independent risk managers. The stress testing and risk assessment exercises are a supplement to the standard limit-setting and risk capital exercises described later in this section, as these processes incorporate events in the marketplace and within Citi that impact our outlook on the form, magnitude, correlation and timing of identified risks that may arise. In addition to enhancing awareness and understanding of potential exposures, the results of these processes then serve as the starting point for developing risk management and mitigation strategies. RISK CAPITAL Risk capital is defined as the amount of capital required to absorb potential unexpected economic losses, resulting from extremely severe events over a one-year time period.  Economic losses include losses that appear on the income statement and fair value adjustments to the financial statements, as well as any further declines in value not captured on the income statement.  Unexpected losses are the difference between potential extremely severe losses and Citigroups expected (average) loss over a one-year time period.  Extremely severe is defined as potential loss at a 99.97% confidence level, based on the distribution of observed events and scenario analysis. The drivers of economic losses are risks, which can be broadly categorized as credit risk (including cross-border risk), market risk (including liquidity) and operational risk (including legal and regulatory):  Credit risk losses primarily result from a borrowers or counterpartys inability to meet its obligations.  Market risk losses arise from fluctuations in the market value of trading and non-trading positions, including the treatment changes in value resulting from fluctuations in rates.  Operational risk losses result from inadequate or failed internal processes, systems or human factors or from external events. These risks are measured and aggregated within businesses and across Citigroup to facilitate the understanding of our exposure to extreme downside events. In light of market developments, the risk capital framework is being reviewed and enhanced. Certain enhancements were introduced in January 2009, including the treatment of operational risk and proprietary investments. Other enhancements are scheduled to be completed over the course of the year, primarily focused on market risk. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Credit risk is the potential for financial loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations. Credit risk arises in many of Citigroups business activities, including:  lending;  sales and trading;  derivatives;  securities transactions;  settlement; and  when Citigroup acts as an intermediary on behalf of its clients and other third parties. 52 Table of Contents LOANS OUTSTANDING In millions of dollars at year end 2008 2007 (2) 2006 (2) 2005 (2) 2004 (2) Consumer loans In U.S. offices: Mortgage and real estate (1) $ 229,565 $ 251,927 $ 225,900 $ 192,045 $ 161,755 Installment, revolving credit, and other 130,826 140,797 131,008 127,432 134,128 Lease financing 31 3,151 4,743 5,095 6,030 $ 360,422 $ 395,875 $ 361,651 $ 324,572 $ 301,913 In offices outside the U.S.: Mortgage and real estate (1) $ 48,277 $ 55,152 $ 44,457 $ 39,619 $ 39,601 Installment, revolving credit, and other 109,932 139,369 105,393 89,559 92,647 Lease financing 304 1,124 960 866 1,619 $ 158,513 $ 195,645 $ 150,810 $ 130,044 $ 133,867 $ 518,935 $ 591,520 $ 512,461 $ 454,616 $ 435,780 Unearned income 738 787 460 4 (554 ) Consumer loansnet $ 519,673 $ 592,307 $ 512,921 $ 454,620 $ 435,226 Corporate loans In U.S. offices: Commercial and industrial $ 33,450 $ 30,092 $ 23,311 $ 20,846 $ 13,821 Loans to financial institutions 10,200 8,778 4,126 1,235 616 Lease financing 1,476 1,630 2,101 1,952 1,879 Mortgage and real estate (1) 6,560 2,220 168 29 100 $ 51,686 $ 42,720 $ 29,706 $ 24,062 $ 16,416 In offices outside the U.S.: Commercial and industrial $ 99,389 $ 116,145 $ 105,872 $ 80,116 $ 77,052 Mortgage and real estate (1) 7,480 4,156 5,334 5,206 3,928 Loans to financial institutions 18,413 20,467 21,827 16,889 12,921 Lease financing 1,850 2,292 2,024 2,082 2,485 Governments and official institutions 385 442 1,857 882 1,100 $ 127,517 $ 143,502 $ 136,914 $ 105,175 $ 97,486 $ 179,203 $ 186,222 $ 166,620 $ 129,237 $ 113,902 Unearned income (4,660 ) (536 ) (349 ) (354 ) (299 ) Corporate loansnet $ 174,543 $ 185,686 $ 166,271 $ 128,883 $ 113,603 Total loansnet of unearned income $ 694,216 $ 777,993 $ 679,192 $ 583,503 $ 548,829 Allowance for loan losseson drawn exposures (29,616 ) (16,117 ) (8,940 ) (9,782 ) (11,269 ) Total loansnet of unearned income and allowance for credit losses $ 664,600 $ 761,876 $ 670,252 $ 573,721 $ 537,560 Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loansnet of unearned income 4.27 % 2.07 % 1.32 % 1.68 % 2.05 % (1) Loans secured primarily by real estate.

These are loans in which the borrower has fallen behind in interest payments and are now considered impaired. In situations where the Company reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal and interest owed will ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income.

As such, analysis against the industry is not always comparable. The table below represents the Companys view of non-performing assets. As a general rule, consumer loans are charged off at 120 days past due and credit card loans are charged off at 180 days contractually past due. Consumer loans secured with non-real-estate collateral are written down to the estimated value of the collateral, less costs to sell, at 120 days past due. Consumer real-estate secured loans are written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs to sell, when they are 180 days contractually past due. Impaired corporate loans and leases are written down to the extent that principal is judged to be uncollectible.

Approval policies for a product or business are tailored to internal profitability and credit risk portfolio performance. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO REVIEW Citigroups consumer loan portfolio is comparatively diversified by both product and location. In the Consumer portfolio, credit loss experience is often expressed in terms of annualized net credit losses as a percentage of average loans. Consumer loans are generally written off no later than a predetermined number of days past due on a contractual basis, or earlier in the event of bankruptcy. The following table summarizes delinquency and net credit loss experience in both the managed and on-balance-sheet consumer loan portfolios. The managed loan portfolio includes held-for-sale and securitized credit card receivables. Only North America Cards from a product view, and North America from a regional view, are impacted. Although a managed basis presentation is not in conformity with GAAP, the Company believes managed credit statistics provide a representation of performance and key indicators of the credit card business that are consistent with the way management reviews operating performance and allocates resources. For example, the North America Cards business considers both on-balance-sheet and securitized balances (together, its managed portfolio) when determining capital allocation and general management decisions and compensation. Furthermore, investors use information about the credit quality of the entire managed portfolio, as the results of both the on-balance-sheet and securitized portfolios impact the overall performance of the North America Cards business.

Citigroups total allowance for loans, leases and unfunded lending commitments of $30.503 billion is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire portfolio. For analytical purposes only, the portion of Citigroups allowance for loan losses attributed to the Consumer portfolio was $22.366 billion at December 31, 2008, $12.393 billion at December 31, 2007 and $6.006 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase in the allowance for loan losses from December 31, 2007 of $9.973 billion included net builds of $11.034 billion. The builds consisted of $10.785 billion in Global Cards and Consumer Banking ($8.216 billion in North America and $2.569 billion in regions outside North America), and $249 million in Global Wealth Management. The build of $8.216 billion in North America primarily reflected an increase in the estimate of losses across all portfolios based on weakening leading credit indicators, including increased delinquencies on first and second mortgages, unsecured personal loans, credit cards and auto loans. The build also reflected trends in the U.S. macroeconomic environment, including the housing market downturn, rising unemployment and portfolio growth. The build of $2.569 billion in regions outside North America primarily reflected portfolio growth the impact of recent acquisitions, and credit deterioration in Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Spain, Greece, India and Colombia. On-balance-sheet consumer loans of $515.7 billion decreased $42.1 billion, or 8%, from December 31, 2007, primarily driven by a decrease in residential real estate lending in North America Consumer Banking as well as the impact of foreign currency translation across Global Cards, Consumer Banking and GWM. Citigroup Mortgage Foreclosure Moratoriums On February 13, 2009, Citigroup announced the initiation of a foreclosure moratorium on all Citigroup-owned first mortgage loans that are the principal residence of the owner as well as all loans serviced by the Company where the Company has reached an understanding with the owner. The moratorium was effective February 12, 2009, and will extend until the earlier of the U.S. governments loan modification program (described below) or March 12, 2009. The Company will not initiate or complete any new foreclosures on eligible owners during this time. The above foreclosure moratorium expands on the Companys current foreclosure moratorium pursuant to which Citigroup will not initiate or complete a foreclosure sale on any eligible owner where Citigroup owns the mortgage and the owner is seeking to stay in the home (which is the owners primary residence), is working in good faith with the Company and has sufficient income for affordable mortgage payments. Since the start of the housing crisis in 2007, Citigroup has worked successfully with approximately 440,000 homeowners to avoid potential foreclosure on combined mortgages totaling approximately $43 billion. Proposed U.S. Mortgage Modification Legislation In January 2009, both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives introduced legislation (the Legislation) that would give bankruptcy courts the authority to modify mortgage loans originated on borrowers principal residences in Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Support for some version of this Legislation has been endorsed by the Obama Administration. The modification provisions of the Legislation require that the mortgage loan to be modified be originated prior to the effective date of the Legislation, and that the debtor receive a notice of foreclosure and attempt to contact the mortgage lender/servicer regarding modification of the loan. It is difficult to project the impact the Legislation may have on the Companys consumer secured and unsecured lending portfolio and capital market positions. Any impact will be dependent on numerous factors, including the final form of the Legislation, the implementation guidelines for the Administrations housing plan, the number of borrowers who file for bankruptcy after enactment of the Legislation and the response of the markets and credit rating agencies. Consumer Credit Outlook Consumer credit losses in 2009 are expected to increase from prior-year levels due to the following:  Continued deterioration in the U.S. housing and labor markets and higher levels of bankruptcy filings are expected to drive higher losses in both the secured and unsecured portfolios.  Negative economic outlook around the globe, most notably in EMEA, will continue to lead to higher credit costs in Global Cards and Consumer Banking. 59 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Associated with Consumer Mortgage Lending Activity Citigroup originates and funds mortgage loans. As with all other lending activity, this exposes Citigroup to several risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks. To manage credit and liquidity risk, Citigroup sells most of the mortgage loans it originates, but retains the servicing rights. These sale transactions create an intangible asset referred to as mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). The fair value of this asset is primarily affected by changes in prepayments that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates. Thus, by retaining the servicing rights of sold mortgage loans, Citigroup is still exposed to interest rate risk. In managing this risk, Citigroup hedges a significant portion of the value of its MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed securities, and purchased securities classified as trading (primarily mortgage-backed securities including principal-only strips). Since the change in the value of these hedging instruments does not perfectly match the change in the value of the MSRs, Citigroup is still exposed to what is commonly referred to as basis risk. Citigroup manages this risk by reviewing the mix of the various hedging instruments referred to above on a daily basis. Citigroups MSRs totaled $5.567 billion and $8.380 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For additional information about the Companys MSRs, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 165. As part of the mortgage lending activity, Citigroup commonly enters into purchase commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at specific interest rates within a given period of time, generally up to 60 days after the rate has been set. If the resulting loans from these commitments will be classified as loans held-for-sale, Citigroup accounts for the commitments as derivatives under SFAS 133. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these commitments, which are driven by changes in mortgage interest rates, are recognized in current earnings after taking into consideration the likelihood that the commitment will be funded. However, a value is not assigned to the MSRs until after the loans have been funded and sold. Citigroup hedges its exposure to the change in the value of these commitments by utilizing hedging instruments similar to those referred to above. The Company has risk-sharing agreements with various Mortgage Insurance (MI) companies through company-owned captive reinsurance entities. Under these arrangements, the Company shares in MI premium revenue and participates in losses above a predetermined level (floor), limited by a predetermined loss amount (ceiling), at which time additional losses revert back to the MI companies. The agreements currently support a total of $28.1 billion of loans with $7.1 billion of MI coverage, principally on loans sold to government agencies. During 2008, projections by the MI companies indicated that losses for some books of business were likely to exceed the floor and the Company recorded $67 million in reserves. Total maximum exposure under these captive reinsurance agreements is $1.3 billion. U.S. Consumer Mortgage Lending Portfolio The Companys U.S. Consumer mortgage portfolio consists of both first and second mortgages, originated primarily by the N.A. Consumer Banking business. As of December 31, 2008, the first mortgage portfolio totaled approximately $134 billion while the second mortgage portfolio was approximately $59 billion. In some cases, some specific portfolios have been excluded from or added to the information presented below, generally due to differences in methodology or variations in the manner in which information is captured. We have noted such exclusions or additions in instances where the Company believes they could be material to reconcile the information presented. North America Residential Real Estate lending disclosure excludes approximately $19 billion of consumer mortgage loans in Global Wealth Management (GWM). The GWM loans are primarily in the U.S. business and typically have better aggregate risk characteristics than those in the U.S. Consumer portfolio. Approximately 83% of the first mortgage portfolio had FICO (Fair Isaac Corporation) credit scores of at least 620 at origination; the remainder was originated with FICO scores of less than 620. As a consequence of the difficult economic environment and the decrease in housing prices, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and FICO scores have deteriorated since origination as depicted in the table below. On a refreshed basis, approximately 26% of first mortgages had a FICO score below 620, compared to around 17% at origination. Balances: December 31, 2008First Mortgages Note: First mortgage table excludes Canada and Puerto Rico ($2.0 billion) and First Collateral Services ($0.1 billion commercial loans portfolio). Refreshed FICO scores based on updated credit scores obtained from Fair Isaac Corporation. Refreshed LTV ratios are derived from data at origination updated using mainly the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index or the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight Housing Price Index. Tables exclude $2.6 billion from At Origination balances and $9.9 billion from Refreshed balances for which FICO and LTV data was unavailable. 90+ DPD delinquency rate for the excluded mortgages is 4.69% and 4.06% respectively, vs. 5.66% for total portfolio. Excluding Government insured loans (described below), the 90+DPD delinquency rate for the first mortgage portfolio is 5.13%. The Companys first mortgage portfolio includes $3.3 billion of loans with Federal Housing Administration or Veterans Administration guarantees. These portfolios consist of loans originated to low-to-moderate-income borrowers with lower FICO scores and generally have higher LTVs. These loans have high delinquency rates (approximately 35% 90+DPD) but, given the government insurance, the Company has experienced negligible credit losses on these loans. The first mortgage portfolio also includes $2.0 billion of loans with LTVs above 80% which have insurance through private mortgage insurance companies and $4.7 billion of loans subject to Long-Term Standby Commitments1 with Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSE), for which the Company has limited exposure to credit losses. In the second mortgage portfolio, the majority of loans are in the higher FICO categories. However, the challenging economic conditions have created a migration towards lower FICO scores and higher LTV ratios. Approximately 43% of that portfolio had refreshed loan-to-value ratios of 90% or more, compared to about 30% at origination. 1 A Long-Term Standby Commitment (LTSC) is a structured transaction in which the Company transfers the credit risk of certain eligible loans to an investor in exchange for a fee. These loans remain on balance sheet unless they reach a certain delinquency level (between 120 and 180 days), in which case the LTSC investor is required to buy the loan at par. 60 Table of Contents Balances: December 31, 2008Second Mortgages Note: Refreshed FICO scores based on updated credit scores obtained from Fair Isaac Corporation. Refreshed LTV ratios are derived from data at origination updated using mainly the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index or the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight Housing Price Index. Tables exclude $0.7 billion from At Origination balances and $0.1 billion from Refreshed balances for which FICO and LTV data was unavailable. 90+ DPD delinquency rate for the excluded mortgages is 1.72% and 2.10% respectively, vs. 2.39% for total portfolio. The second mortgage portfolio includes $2.9 billion of insured loans with LTVs above 90% and $2.6 billion of loans subject to Long-Term Standby Commitments with GSE, for which the Company has limited exposure to credit losses. The following tables provide delinquency statistics for loans 90 or more days past due (90+DPD) in both the first and second mortgage portfolios. Loans with FICO scores of less than 620 exhibit significantly higher delinquencies than in any other FICO band, particularly on a refreshed basis. This difference is most noticeable for loans with refreshed FICOs of less than 620 and LTVs of at least 90%: first mortgages had a 90+DPD of 25.4%, while second mortgages were at 24.5%. Delinquencies: 90+DPDFirst Mortgages Note: 90+DPD are based on balances referenced in the tables above. Delinquencies: 90+DPDSecond Mortgages Note: 90+DPD are based on balances referenced in the tables above. Second mortgages with FICOs below 620 at origination are less than 1% of the total, and the Company provides 90+DPD delinquency rates as a measure of their performance. In light of increased delinquencies in the U.S. Consumer mortgage portfolios, during 2008 the Company expanded its allowance for loan losses related to these portfolios by approximately $4.5 billion. As of the end of 2008, the coincident reserve coverage ratio for the first and second mortgage portfolios was at 15.7 months and 13.8 months, respectively. The following charts detail the quarterly trends in delinquencies for the Companys first and second U.S. Consumer mortgage portfolios. As set forth in the chart, delinquencies have increased substantially:  The first mortgage delinquency trend shows that year-end delinquency levels have more than doubled 2003 levels. A further breakout of the FICO below 620 segment indicates that delinquencies in this segment are two times higher than in the overall first mortgage portfolio.  Delinquency rates in the second mortgage portfolio are at historically high levels, particularly in the 90% or higher LTV segment. This segment has a year-end delinquency rate almost twice as high as the rate for the overall second mortgage portfolio. Net credit losses have also increased significantly. First mortgages net credit losses as a percentage of average loans increased by close to 4.5 times since the end of 2007, while that of second mortgages tripled. 61 Table of Contents First mortgage net credit losses as a percentage of average loans are nearly half the level of those in the second mortgage portfolio, despite much higher delinquencies in the first mortgage portfolio. Two major factors explain this relationship:  First mortgages include government-guaranteed loans.  Second mortgages are much more likely to go directly from delinquency to charge-off without going into foreclosure. During 2008, the Company increased its efforts to contain the rise in delinquencies and mitigate losses. The Company continues to tighten credit requirements through higher FICOs, lower LTVs, increased documentation and verifications. This shift has resulted in loans originated in 2008 having higher FICO scores and lower LTVs, on average, than those originated in 2007.

The Citi Homeowner Assistance program is an example of such efforts, preemptively reaching out to homeowners not currently behind on their mortgage payments, but that may require help to remain current on their mortgages. These efforts focus particularly on borrowers in geographies facing extreme economic distress. Third, the Company has initiated various mortgage foreclosure moratoriums. See Citigroup Mortgage Foreclosure Moratoriums on page 59. The following tables detail the Companys first and second U.S. Consumer mortgage portfolio by origination channels, geographic distribution and origination vintage. By Origination Channel The Companys U.S. Consumer mortgage portfolio was originated from three main channels: retail, broker and correspondent.  Retail: loans originated through a direct relationship with the borrower.  Broker: loans originated through a mortgage broker, where the Company underwrites the loan directly with the borrower.  Correspondent: loans originated and funded by a third party, where the Company purchases the closed loans after the correspondent has funded the loan. Includes loans acquired in large bulk purchases from other mortgage originators. These types of purchases, used primarily in 2006 and 2007, mainly focused on non-prime and second-lien loans to be held on Citigroups balance sheet. This method of acquisition was discontinued in 2007, and the current correspondent channel focuses on acquisition of loans eligible for sale to the GSEs. First Mortgages: December 31, 2008 Note: Data at origination. $134 billion portfolio excludes Canada and Puerto Rico, First Collateral Services (commercial portfolio), deferred fees/costs, loans held-for-sale and loans sold with recourse. Excluding Government insured loans, 90+DPD for the first mortgage portfolio is 5.13%. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 43% of the first mortgage portfolio was originated through the correspondent channel, a reduction from approximately 47% as of the end of 2007. Given that loans originated through correspondents have exhibited higher 90+DPD delinquency rates than retail originated mortgages, the Company terminated business with a number of correspondent sellers in 2007 and 2008. During 2008, over 96% of the loans originated through this channel were eligible to be sold to the GSEs. During 2008, the Company has severed relationships with a number of brokers, only maintaining those who have produced strong, high-quality and profitable volume. Second Mortgages: December 31, 2008 Note: Data at origination. Second mortgage 90+DPD rate calculated by OTS methodology. For second mortgages, approximately 54% of the loans were originated through third-party channels. As these mortgages have demonstrated a higher incidence of delinquencies, the Company no longer originates second mortgages through third-party channels, which represented 59% of the portfolio as of the end of 2007. 63 Table of Contents By State Approximately half of the Companys U.S. Consumer mortgage portfolio remains concentrated in five states: California, New York, Florida, Illinois, and Texas. Those states represent 49% of first mortgages and 57% of second mortgages. During 2008, unemployment was the key driver of delinquencies: despite sharp differences in the quality of their portfolio, California and Florida experienced above average rises in 90+DPD. California, which has only 3% of its first mortgage portfolio originated in the FICO<620 band, experienced a 2.7 times rise in delinquencies, to 4.13%. Florida, which has 21% of its loans in that FICO band, also suffered a similar rise in delinquencies, albeit to a much higher rate of 12.24%. Texas, despite having 34% of its portfolio originated with FICO<620, experienced a relatively mild rise in delinquencies, a consequence of its below average increase in unemployment rate. First Mortgages: December 31, 2008 Note: Data at origination. $134 billion portfolio excludes Canada and Puerto Rico, First Collateral Services (commercial portfolio), deferred fees/costs, loans held for sale and loans sold with recourse. Excluding Government insured loans, 90+DPD for the first mortgage portfolio is 5.13%. In the second mortgage portfolio, Florida and California maintained above-average delinquencies, with approximately 18% and 22% of their loans originated in the LTV ³90% band. Second Mortgages: December 31, 2008 Note: Data at origination. Second mortgage 90+DPD rate calculated by OTS methodology. By Vintage Approximately half of the Companys U.S. Consumer mortgage portfolio consisted of 2006 and 2007 vintages, which demonstrated above average delinquencies. In first mortgages, approximately 45% of the portfolio is of 2006 and 2007 vintages, which on aggregate have a 90+DPD of 8.15%, well above the 5.66% of the overall portfolio. Approximately 43% is pre-2005 vintage, with an aggregated delinquency of 4.28%. In second mortgages, slightly over 61% of the portfolio is of 2006 and 2007 vintages and approximately 33% is pre-2005 vintage. First Mortgages: December 31, 2008 Note: Data at origination. $134 billion portfolio excludes Canada and Puerto Rico, First Collateral Services (commercial portfolio), deferred fees/costs, loans held for sale and loans sold with recourse. Excluding Government insured loans, 90+DPD for the first mortgage portfolio is 5.13%. Second Mortgages: December 31, 2008 Note: Data at origination. Second mortgage 90+DPD rate calculated by OTS methodology. 64 Table of Contents CORPORATE CREDIT RISK For corporate clients and investment banking activities across Citigroup, the credit process is grounded in a series of fundamental policies, including:  joint business and independent risk management responsibility for managing credit risks;  a single center of control for each credit relationship that coordinates credit activities with that client;  portfolio limits to ensure diversification and maintain risk/capital alignment;  a minimum of two authorized-credit-officer signatures required on extensions of credit, one of which must be from a credit officer in credit risk management;  risk rating standards, applicable to every obligor and facility; and  consistent standards for credit origination documentation and remedial management. The following table represents the corporate credit portfolio, before consideration of collateral, by maturity at December 31, 2008. The corporate portfolio is broken out by direct outstandings which include drawn loans, overdrafts, interbank placements, bankers acceptances, certain investment securities and leases and unfunded commitments which include unused commitments to lend, letters of credit and financial guarantees.

Obligor risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for an obligor and are derived primarily through the use of statistical models (which are validated periodically), external rating agencies (under defined circumstances) or approved scoring methodologies. Facility risk ratings are assigned, using the obligor risk rating, and then factors that affect the loss-given default of the facility, such as support or collateral, are taken into account. Internal obligor ratings equivalent to BBB and above are considered investment grade. Ratings below the equivalent of the BBB category are considered non-investment grade. The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio by facility risk rating at December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a percentage of the total portfolio: Direct outstandings andunfunded commitments 2008 2007 AAA/AA/A 57 % 53 % BBB 24 24 BB/B 13 20 CCC or below 6 2 Unrated  1 Total 100 % 100 % The corporate credit portfolio is diversified by industry, with a concentration only in the financial sector, including banks, other financial institutions, insurance companies, investment banks and government and central banks.

The purpose of these transactions is to transfer credit risk to third parties. The results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected in the Principal transactions line on the Consolidated Statement of Income. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $95.5 billion and $123.7 billion, respectively, of credit risk exposure were economically hedged. Citigroups expected loss model used in the calculation of its loan loss reserve does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other risk mitigants. The reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded commitments in this report do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the credit protection was economically hedging underlying credit exposure with the following risk rating distribution: Rating of Hedged Exposure 2008 2007 AAA/AA/A 54 % 53 % BBB 32 34 BB/B 9 11 CCC or below 5 2 Total 100 % 100 % At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the credit protection was economically hedging underlying credit exposure with the following industry distribution: Industry of Hedged Exposure 2008 2007 Utilities 10 % 9 % Telephone and cable 9 11 Agriculture and food preparation 7 6 Petroleum 7 7 Industrial machinery and equipment 6 5 Insurance 5 5 Chemicals 5 4 Retail 5 5 Other financial institutions 4 5 Autos 4 5 Pharmaceuticals 4 4 Natural gas distribution 4 3 Global information technology 4 3 Metals 3 3 Investment banks 2 3 Other industries (1) 21 22 Total 100 % 100 % (1) Includes all other industries, none of which is greater than 2% of the total hedged amount. For further discussion regarding credit derivatives see Note 29 on page 208. 66 Table of Contents GLOBAL CORPORATE PORTFOLIO REVIEW Corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a non-accrual basis (cash basis) when it is determined that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is past due for 90 days or more; the exception is when the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Impaired corporate loans are written down to the extent that the principal is judged to be uncollectible. Impaired collateral-dependent loans are written down to the lower of cost or collateral value, less disposal costs. See Non-Accrual Loans on page 55 for details on the corporate non-accrual portfolio. There is no industry-wide definition of non-performing assets. As such, analysis against the industry is not always comparable. The following table summarizes corporate non-accrual loans, which are a part of the Companys non-performing assets, and net credit losses. In millions of dollars 2008 2007 2006 Corporate non-accrual loans North America $ 2,160 $ 290 $ 59 EMEA 6,630 1,173 186 Latin America 238 127 173 Asia 541 168 117 Total corporate non-accrual loans (1) $ 9,569 $ 1,758 $ 535 Net credit losses (recoveries) Securities and Banking $ 1,711 $ 649 $ 49 Transaction Services 62 24 27 Corporate/Other  (2 ) 6 Total net credit losses (recoveries) $ 1,773 $ 671 $ 82 Corporate allowance for loan losses $ 7,250 $ 3,724 $ 2,934 Corporate allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments (2) 887 1,250 1,100 Total corporate allowance for loans, leases and unfunded lending commitments $ 8,137 $ 4,974 $ 4,034 As a percentage of total corporate loans (3) 4.15 % 2.01 % 1.76 % (1) Excludes purchased distressed loans as they are accreting interest in accordance with SOP 03-3. The carrying value of these loans was $1,510 million at December 31, 2008, $2,373 million at December 31, 2007, and $949 million at December 31, 2006. (2) Represents additional reserves recorded in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (3) Does not include the allowance for unfunded lending commitments. Cash-basis loans on December 31, 2008 increased $7.811 billion from 2007, of which $5.457 billion was in EMEA and $1.870 billion was in North America. This increase is primarily attributable to the transfer of non-accrual loans from the held-for-sale portfolio to the held-for-investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2008. These loans were previously accounted for on a LOCOM basis and were transferred at their carrying value, which was net of any write-downs previously recorded. If, instead of recording direct markdowns, the loans were included in the loan balance at par and the markdowns were included in reserves, the ratio of corporate allowance for loan losses to non-accrual loans would have been approximately 100%. Cash-basis loans on December 31, 2007 increased $1.223 billion from 2006 primarily due to the impact of subprime activity in the U.K. and U.S. markets. Total corporate loans outstanding at December 31, 2008 were $175 billion compared to $186 billion at December 31, 2007. Total NCL of $1.773 billion in 2008 increased $1.102 billion from 2007, primarily due to significant write-downs reflecting the continued weakening of the economy. Total corporate net credit losses of $671 million in 2007 increased $589 million from 2006, primarily related to the $535 million in write-offs on loans with subprime-related direct exposure. Citigroups total allowance for loans, leases and unfunded lending commitments of $30.503 billion is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire portfolio. For analytical purposes only, the portion of Citigroups allowance for credit losses attributed to the corporate portfolio was $8.137 billion at December 31, 2008, $4.974 billion at December 31, 2007 and $4.034 billion at December 31, 2006. The $3.163 billion increase in the corporate allowance at December 31, 2008 from December 31, 2007 primarily reflects a weakening in overall portfolio credit quality, as well as loan-loss reserves for specific counterparties. The $940 million increase in the corporate allowance at December 31, 2007 from December 31, 2006 primarily reflects a weakening in overall portfolio credit quality, as well as loan-loss reserves for specific counterparties. The loan-loss reserves for specific counterparties include $327 million for subprime-related direct exposures. Losses on corporate lending activities and the level of cash-basis loans can vary widely with respect to timing and amount, particularly within any narrowly defined business or loan type. 67 Table of Contents EXPOSURE TO U.S. REAL ESTATE IN SECURITIES AND BANKING Subprime-Related Exposure in Securities and Banking The following table summarizes Citigroups U.S. subprime-related direct exposures in Securities and Banking (S&B) at December 31, 2007 and 2008: In billions of dollars December 31, 2007exposures 2008 write-downs (1) 2008 sales/transfers (2) December 31, 2008exposures Direct ABS CDO super senior exposures: Gross ABS CDO super senior exposures (A) $ 39.8 $ 18.9 Hedged exposures (B) 10.5 6.9 Net ABS CDO super senior exposures: ABCP/CDO (3) 20.6 $ (9.0 ) $ (1.7 ) 9.9 High grade 4.9 (2.5 ) (4) (1.6 ) 0.8 Mezzanine 3.6 (1.4 ) (4) (1.0 ) 1.3 ABS CDO-squared 0.2 (0.2 ) 0.0 0.0 Total net ABS CDO super senior exposures (A-B=C) $ 29.3 $ (13.1 ) $ (4.2 ) (5) $ 12.0 Lending and structuring exposures: CDO warehousing/unsold tranches of ABS CDOs $ 0.2 $ (0.1 ) $ 0.0 $ 0.1 Subprime loans purchased for sale or securitization 4.0 (1.3 ) (1.4 ) 1.3 Financing transactions secured by subprime 3.8 (0.4 ) (4) (2.6 ) 0.7 Total lending and structuring exposures (D) $ 8.0 $ (1.8 ) $ (4.0 ) $ 2.0 Total net exposures C+D (6) $ 37.3 $ (14.9 ) $ (8.3 ) $ 14.1 Credit adjustment on hedged counterparty exposures (E) (7) $ (5.7 ) Total net write-downs (C+D+E) $ (20.7 ) Note: Table may not foot or cross-foot due to roundings.

Subprime-Related Direct Exposure in Securities and Banking The Company had approximately $14.1 billion in net U.S. subprime-related direct exposures in its S&B business at December 31, 2008. The exposure consisted of (a) approximately $12.0 billion of net exposures in the super senior tranches (i.e., the most senior tranches) of CDOs, which are collateralized by asset-backed securities, derivatives on asset-backed securities, or both (ABS CDOs), and (b) approximately $2.1 billion of exposures in its lending and structuring business. Direct ABS CDO Super Senior Exposures The net $12.0 billion in ABS CDO super senior exposures as of December 31, 2008 is collateralized primarily by subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), derivatives on RMBS, or both. These exposures include $9.9 billion in the super senior tranches of ABS CDOs initially issued as commercial paper (ABCP) and approximately $2.1 billion of other super senior tranches of ABS CDOs. Citigroups CDO super senior subprime direct exposures are Level 3 assets and are subject to valuation based on significant unobservable inputs. Fair value of these exposures (other than high grade and mezzanine as described below) is based on estimates of future cash flows from the mortgage loans underlying the assets of the ABS CDOs. To determine the performance of the underlying mortgage loan portfolios, the Company estimates the prepayments, defaults and loss severities based on a number of macroeconomic factors, including housing price changes, unemployment rates, interest rates, and borrower and loan attributes, such as age, credit scores, documentation status, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. The model is calibrated using available mortgage loan information including historical loan performance. In addition, the methodology estimates the impact of geographic concentration of mortgages and the impact of reported fraud in the origination of subprime mortgages. An appropriate discount rate is then applied to the cash flows generated for each ABCP- and CDO-squared tranche, in order to estimate its current fair value. See Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates on page 18. When necessary, the valuation methodology used by Citigroup is refined and the inputs used for purposes of estimation are modified, in part, to reflect ongoing market developments. More specifically, the inputs of home price appreciation (HPA) assumptions and delinquency data were updated throughout the year along with discount rates that are based upon a weighted average combination of implied spreads from single-name ABS bond prices and ABX indices, as well as CLO spreads. 68 Table of Contents The 2008 fourth quarter housing-price changes were estimated using a forward-looking projection. In the second half of 2008, this projection incorporated the Loan Performance Index, whereas in the first half of 2008, it incorporated the S&P Case Shiller Index. This change was made because the Loan Performance Index provided more comprehensive geographic data. In addition, the Companys mortgage default model also uses recent mortgage performance data, a period of sharp home price declines and high levels of mortgage foreclosures. The valuation as of December 31, 2008, assumes a cumulative decline in U.S. housing prices from peak to trough of 33%. This rate assumes declines of 16% and 13% in 2008 and 2009, respectively, the remainder of the 33% decline having already occurred before the end of 2007. In addition, during the last three quarters of 2008, the discount rates were based on a weighted average combination of the implied spreads from single-name ABS bond prices, ABX indices and CLO spreads, depending on vintage and asset types. To determine the discount margin, the Company applies the mortgage default model to the bonds underlying the ABX indices and other referenced cash bonds and solves for the discount margin that produces the market prices of those instruments. In the third quarter of 2008, the valuation of the high-grade and mezzanine ABS CDO positions was changed from model valuation to trader prices based on the underlying assets of each high-grade and mezzanine ABS CDO. Unlike the ABCP- and CDO-squared positions, the high-grade and mezzanine positions are now largely hedged through the ABX and bond short positions, which are, by necessity, trader priced. Thus, this change brings closer symmetry in the way these long and short positions are valued by the Company. Additionally, there were a number of liquidations of high-grade and mezzanine positions during the third quarter. These were at prices close to the value of trader prices. The liquidation proceeds in total were also above the June 30, 2008 carrying amount of the positions liquidated. Citigroup intends to use trader marks to value this portion of the portfolio going forward so long as it remains largely hedged. The primary drivers that currently impact the model valuations are the discount rates used to calculate the present value of projected cash flows and projected mortgage loan performance. In valuing its direct ABCP- and CDO-squared super senior exposures, the Company has made its best estimate of the key inputs that should be used in its valuation methodology. However, the size and nature of these positions as well as current market conditions are such that changes in inputs such as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of the cash flows can have a significant impact on the reported value of these exposures. For instance, each 10 basis point change in the discount rate used generally results in an approximate $32 million change in the fair value of the Companys direct ABCP- and CDO-squared super senior exposures as of December 31, 2008. This applies to both decreases in the discount rate (which would increase the value of these assets and decrease reported write-downs) and increases in the discount rate (which would decrease the value of these assets and increase reported write-downs). Estimates of the fair value of the CDO super senior exposures depend on market conditions and are subject to further change over time. In addition, while Citigroup believes that the methodology used to value these exposures is reasonable, the methodology is subject to continuing refinement, including those made as a result of market developments. Further, any observable transactions in respect of some or all of these exposures could be employed in the fair valuation process in accordance with and in the manner called for by SFAS 157. Lending and Structuring Exposures The $2.1 billion of subprime-related exposures includes approximately $0.1 billion of CDO warehouse inventory and unsold tranches of ABS CDOs, approximately $1.3 billion of actively managed subprime loans purchased for resale or securitization at a discount to par during 2007 and approximately $1.3 billion of financing transactions with customers secured by subprime collateral. These amounts represent the fair value as determined using observable inputs and other market data. The majority of the change from the December 31, 2007 balances reflects sales, transfers and liquidations. S&B also has trading positions, both long and short, in U.S. subprime RMBS and related products, including ABS CDOs, which are not included in the figures above. The exposure from these positions is actively managed and hedged, although the effectiveness of the hedging products used may vary with material changes in market conditions. Exposure to Commercial Real Estate The Company, through its business activities and as a capital markets participant, incurs exposures that are directly or indirectly tied to the global commercial real estate market. These exposures are represented primarily by the following three categories: (1) Assets held at fair value include: $5.8 billion, of which approximately $3.5 billion are securities, loans and other items linked to commercial real estate that are carried at fair value as trading account assets, and approximately $2.3 billion of which are securities backed by commercial real estate carried at fair value as available-for-sale investments. Changes in fair value for these trading account assets are reported in current earnings, while changes in fair value for these available-for-sale investments are reported in OCI with other-than-temporary impairments reported in current earnings. The majority of these exposures are classified as Level 3 in the fair-value hierarchy. Weakening activity in the trading markets for some of these instruments resulted in reduced liquidity, thereby decreasing the observable inputs for such valuations, and could have an adverse impact on how these instruments are valued in the future if such conditions persist. During the fourth quarter of 2008, approximately $3.3 billion of commercial real estate loans and loan commitments that had been included in this category, because they were classified as held-for-sale and measured at the lower-of-cost-or-market (LOCOM), were reclassified to assets held at amortized cost since managements intent for these exposures changed to held for investment. (2) Assets held at amortized cost include approximately $2.0 billion of securities classified as held-to-maturity and $24.9 billion of loans and commitments. The held-to-maturity securities were classified as such during the fourth quarter of 2008 and were previously classified as either trading or available for sale. They are accounted for at amortized cost, subject to other-than-temporary impairment. Loans and commitments are recorded at amortized cost, less loan loss reserves. The impact from changes in credit is reflected in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses and in net credit losses. (3) Equity and other investments include approximately $4.7 billion of equity and other investments such as limited partner fund investments which are accounted for under the equity method. 69 Table of Contents Direct Exposure to Monolines In its Securities and Banking business, the Company has exposure to various monoline bond insurers (Monolines), listed in the table below, from hedges on certain investments and from trading positions. The hedges are composed of credit default swaps and other hedge instruments. During 2007, the Company established a $967 million credit valuation adjustment (CVA) reserve on the fair-value exposures related to these Monolines. In 2008, the Company added $5.7 billion to this reserve and recorded utilizations of $2.4 billion, bringing the December 31, 2008 balance to $4.3 billion. The following table summarizes the market value of the Companys direct exposures to and the corresponding notional amounts of transactions with the various Monolines as well as the aggregate credit valuation adjustment associated with these exposures as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 in S&B: December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 In millions of dollars Fair-value exposure Notionalamount of transactions Fair-value exposure Notionalamount of transactions Direct subprime ABS CDO super senior: Ambac $ 4,461 $5,357 $ 1,815 $ 5,485 FGIC   909 1,460 ACA   438 600 Radian   100 100 Subtotal direct subprime ABS CDO super senior $ 4,461 $5,357 $ 3,262 $ 7,645 Trading assetssubprime: Ambac   $ 1,150 $ 1,400 Trading assetssubprime   $ 1,150 $ 1,400 Trading assetsnon-subprime: MBIA $ 1,924 $4,040 $ 395 $ 5,620 FSA 204 1,126 121 1,126 ACA   50 1,925 Assured 141 465 7 340 Radian 58 150 5 350 Ambac 21 1,106  1,971 Trading assetsnon-subprime $ 2,348 $6,887 $ 578 $ 11,332 Subtotal trading assets $ 2,348 $6,887 $ 1,728 $ 12,732 Total gross fair-value direct exposure $ 6,809 $ 4,990 Credit valuation adjustment $(4,279) $ (967 ) Total net fair-value direct exposure $ 2,530 $ 4,023 The fair-value exposure, net of payable and receivable positions, represents the market value of the contract as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, excluding the credit valuation adjustment. The notional amount of the transactions, including both long and short positions, is used as a reference value to calculate payments. The credit valuation adjustment is a downward adjustment to the fair-value exposure to a counterparty to reflect the counterpartys creditworthiness in respect of the obligations in question. Credit market valuation adjustments are based on credit spreads and on estimates of the terms and timing of the payment obligations of the Monolines. Timing in turn depends on estimates of the performance of the transactions to which the Companys exposure relates, estimates of whether and when liquidation of such transactions may occur and other factors, each considered in the context of the terms of the Monolines obligations. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $6.9 billion and $10.5 billion, respectively, in notional amount of hedges against its direct subprime ABS CDO super senior positions. Of those amounts, $5.3 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, were purchased from Monolines and are included in the notional amount of transactions in the table above. The fair value of the hedges provided by the Monolines against the Companys direct subprime ABS CDO super senior positions was $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2008, and $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2007. There was $0.9 billion net fair-value exposure related to direct subprime ABS CDO super senior positions with a notional amount of $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2007, which was settled during the fourth quarter of 2008. With respect to Citis trading assets, there were $2.3 billion and $1.7 billion of fair-value exposure to Monolines as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Trading assets include trading positions, both long and short, in U.S. subprime RMBS and related products, including ABS CDOs. There was $1.2 billion net fair-value exposure related to subprime trading positions with a notional amount of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2007, which was settled during the third quarter of 2008. 70 Table of Contents The notional amount of transactions related to the remaining non-subprime trading assets as of December 31, 2008, was $6.9 billion with a corresponding fair value exposure of $2.3 billion. The $6.9 billion notional amount of transactions comprised $1.8 billion primarily in interest-rate swaps with a corresponding fair value exposure of $3.9 million. The remaining notional amount of $5.1 billion was in the form of credit default swaps and total return swaps with a fair value exposure of $2.3 billion. The notional amount of transactions related to the remaining non-subprime trading assets at December 31, 2007, was $11.3 billion with a corresponding fair value exposure of $578 million. The $11.3 billion notional amount of transactions comprised $4.1 billion primarily in interest-rate swaps with a fair value exposure of $34 million. The remaining notional amount of $7.2 billion was in the form of credit default swaps and total return swaps with a fair value of $544 million. The Company has purchased mortgage insurance from various monoline mortgage insurers on first mortgage loans. The notional amount of this insurance protection was approximately $400 million and $600 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, with nominal pending claims against this notional amount. In addition, Citigroup has indirect exposure to Monolines in various other parts of its businesses. Indirect exposure includes circumstances in which the Company is not a contractual counterparty to the Monolines, but instead owns securities which may benefit from embedded credit enhancements provided by a Monoline. For example, corporate or municipal bonds in the trading business may be insured by the Monolines. The previous table does not capture this type of indirect exposure to the Monolines. Highly Leveraged Financing Transactions Highly leveraged financing commitments are agreements that provide funding to a borrower with higher levels of debt (measured by the ratio of debt capital to equity capital of the borrower) than is generally the case for other companies. In recent years through mid-2008, highly leveraged financing had been commonly employed in corporate acquisitions, management buy-outs and similar transactions. In these financings, debt service (that is, principal and interest payments) absorbs a significant portion of the cash flows generated by the borrowers business. Consequently, the risk that the borrower may not be able to meet its debt obligations is greater. Due to this risk, the interest rates and fees charged for this type of financing are generally higher than for other types of financing. Prior to funding, highly leveraged financing commitments are assessed for impairment in accordance with SFAS 5, and losses are recorded when they are probable and reasonably estimable. For the portion of loan commitments that relates to loans that will be held for investment, loss estimates are made based on the borrowers ability to repay the facility according to its contractual terms. For the portion of loan commitments that relates to loans that will be held for sale, loss estimates are made in reference to current conditions in the resale market (both interest rate risk and credit risk are considered in the estimate). Loan origination, commitment, underwriting and other fees are netted against any recorded losses. Citigroup generally manages the risk associated with highly leveraged financings it has entered into by seeking to sell a majority of its exposures to the market prior to or shortly after funding. In certain cases, all or a portion of a highly leveraged financing to be retained is hedged with credit derivatives or other hedging instruments. Thus, when a highly leveraged financing is funded, Citigroup records the resulting loan as follows:  the portion that Citigroup will seek to sell is recorded as a loan held-for-sale in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and measured at the lower of cost or market (LOCOM); and  the portion that will be retained is recorded as a loan held-for-investment in Loans and measured at amortized cost less a reserve for loan losses. Due to the dislocation of the credit markets and the reduced market interest in higher-risk/higher-yield instruments since the latter half of 2007, liquidity in the market for highly leveraged financings has been limited. This has resulted in the Companys recording pretax write-downs on funded and unfunded highly leveraged finance exposures of $4.9 billion in 2008 and $1.5 billion in 2007. Citigroups exposures for highly leveraged financing commitments totaled $10.0 billion at December 31, 2008 ($9.1 billion funded and $0.9 billion in unfunded commitments), reflecting a decrease of $33.2 billion from December 31, 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2008, Citigroup reclassified $3.3 billion of funded highly leveraged financings from held for sale to held for investment as the Company revised the holding periods for these loans. For further discussion regarding this reclassification, see Reclassification of Financial Assets on page 87. In April 2008, the Company completed the transfer of approximately $12 billion of loans to third parties, of which $8.5 billion relates to highly leveraged loans and commitments. In these transactions, the third parties purchased subordinate interests backed by the transferred loans. These subordinate interests absorb first loss on the transferred loans and provide the third parties with control of the loans. The Company retained senior debt securities backed by the transferred loans. These transactions were accounted for as sales of the transferred loans. The loans were removed from the balance sheet and the retained securities are classified as Available-for-sale securities on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Companys sole remaining exposure to the transferred loans are the senior debt securities and the receivables under the TRS, which have an aggregate carrying value of $8.1 billion as of December 31, 2008. The Company purchased protection on these retained senior positions from the third-party subordinate interest holders via total return swaps. The credit risk in the total return swap is protected through margin arrangements that provide for both initial margin and additional margin at specified triggers. Due to the initial cash margin received and the existing margin requirements on the total return swaps and the substantive subordinate investments made by third parties, the Company believes that the transactions largely mitigate the Companys risk related to these transferred loans. 71 Table of Contents MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Market risk encompasses liquidity risk and price risk, both of which arise in the normal course of business of a global financial intermediary. Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity may be unable to meet a financial commitment to a customer, creditor, or investor when due. Liquidity risk is discussed in the Capital Resources and Liquidity section on page 94. Price risk is the earnings risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices, and in their implied volatilities. Price risk arises in non-trading portfolios, as well as in trading portfolios. Market risks are measured in accordance with established standards to ensure consistency across businesses and the ability to aggregate risk. Each business is required to establish, with approval from independent market risk management, a market risk limit framework for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of Citigroups overall risk appetite. In all cases, the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks they take and for remaining within their defined limits. NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS INTEREST RATE RISK One of Citigroups primary business functions is providing financial products that meet the needs of its customers. Loans and deposits are tailored to the customers requirements with regard to tenor, index, and rate type. Net interest revenue (NIR) is the difference between the yield earned on the non-trading portfolio assets (including customer loans) and the rate paid on the liabilities (including customer deposits or company borrowings). NIR is affected by changes in the level of interest rates. For example:  At any given time, there may be an unequal amount of assets and liabilities which are subject to market rates due to maturation or repricing. Whenever the amount of liabilities subject to repricing exceeds the amount of assets subject to repricing, a company is considered liability sensitive. In this case, a companys NIR will deteriorate in a rising rate environment.  The assets and liabilities of a company may reprice at different speeds or mature at different times, subjecting both liability-sensitive and asset-sensitive companies to NIR sensitivity from changing interest rates. For example, a company may have a large amount of loans that are subject to repricing this period, but the majority of deposits are not scheduled for repricing until the following period. That company would suffer from NIR deterioration if interest rates were to fall. NIR in the current period is the result of customer transactions and the related contractual rates originated in prior periods as well as new transactions in the current period; those prior-period transactions will be impacted by changes in rates on floating-rate assets and liabilities in the current period. Due to the long-term nature of the portfolios, NIR will vary from quarter to quarter even assuming no change in the shape or level of the yield curve as the assets and liabilities reprice. These repricings are a function of implied forward interest rates, which represent the overall markets unbiased estimate of future interest rates and incorporate possible changes in the Federal Funds rate as well as the shape of the yield curve. INTEREST RATE RISK GOVERNANCE The risks in Citigroups non-traded portfolios are estimated using a common set of standards that define, measure, limit and report the market risk. Each business is required to establish, with approval from independent market risk management, a market risk limit framework that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of Citigroups overall risk appetite. In all cases, the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks they take and for remaining within their defined limits. These limits are monitored by independent market risk, country and business Asset and Liability Committees (ALCOs) and the Global Finance and Asset and Liability Committee (FinALCO). INTEREST RATE RISK MEASUREMENT Citigroups principal measure of risk to NIR is interest rate exposure (IRE). IRE measures the change in expected NIR in each currency resulting solely from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates. Factors such as changes in volumes, spreads, margins and the impact of prior-period pricing decisions are not captured by IRE. IRE assumes that businesses make no additional changes in pricing or balances in response to the unanticipated rate changes. IRE tests the impact on NIR resulting from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates. For example, if the current 90-day LIBOR rate is 3% and the one-year-forward rate is 5% (i.e., the estimated 90-day LIBOR rate in one year), the +100 bps IRE scenario measures the impact on the companys NIR of a 100 bps instantaneous change in the 90-day LIBOR to 6% in one year. The impact of changing prepayment rates on loan portfolios is incorporated into the results. For example, in the declining interest rate scenarios, it is assumed that mortgage portfolios prepay faster and income is reduced. In addition, in a rising interest rate scenario, portions of the deposit portfolio are assumed to experience rate increases that may be less than the change in market interest rates. MITIGATION AND HEDGING OF RISK All financial institutions financial performances are subject to some degree of risk due to changes in interest rates. In order to manage these risks effectively, Citigroup may modify pricing on new customer loans and deposits, enter into transactions with other institutions or enter into off-balance-sheet derivative transactions that have the opposite risk exposures. Therefore, Citigroup regularly assesses the viability of strategies to reduce unacceptable risks to earnings and implements such strategies when the Company believes those actions are prudent. As information becomes available, Citigroup formulates strategies aimed at protecting earnings from the potential negative effects of changes in interest rates. Citigroup employs additional measurements, including stress testing the impact of non-linear interest rate movements on the value of the balance sheet; the analysis of portfolio duration and volatility, particularly as they relate to mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities; and the potential impact of the change in the spread between different market indices. 72 Table of Contents The exposures in the following table represent the approximate annualized risk to NIR assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps change, as well as a more gradual 100 bps (25 bps per quarter) parallel change in rates compared with the market forward interest rates in selected currencies. December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 In millions of dollars Increase Decrease Increase Decrease U.S. dollar Instantaneous change $ (801 ) $ 391 $ (940 ) $ 837 Gradual change $ (456 ) $ 81 $ (527 ) $ 540 Mexican peso Instantaneous change $ (18 ) $ 18 $ (25 ) $ 25 Gradual change $ (14 ) $ 14 $ (17 ) $ 17 Euro Instantaneous change $ (56 ) $ 57 $ (63 ) $ 63 Gradual change $ (43 ) $ 43 $ (32 ) $ 32 Japanese yen Instantaneous change $ 172 NM $ 67 NM Gradual change $ 51 NM $ 43 NM Pound sterling Instantaneous change $ (1 ) $ 1 $ (16 ) $ 16 Gradual change $  $  $ (4 ) $ 4 NM Not meaningful. A 100 bps decrease in interest rates would imply negative rates for the Japanese yen yield curve. The changes in the U.S. dollar IRE from the prior year reflect changes in the customer-related asset and liability mix, 2008 capital changes, and Citigroups view of prevailing interest rates. The following table shows the risk to NIR from six different changes in the implied forward rates. Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur on a gradual basis every three months over the course of one year. Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4 Scenario 5 Scenario 6 Overnight rate change (bps)  100 200 (200 ) (100 )  10-year rate change (bps) (100 )  100 (100 )  100 Impact to net interest revenue (in millions of dollars) $ (424 ) $ (435 ) $ (576 ) $ (333 ) $ 28 $ 30 Trading Portfolios Price risk in trading portfolios is monitored using a series of measures, including:  factor sensitivities;  Value-at-Risk (VAR); and  Stress testing. Factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of a position for a defined change in a market risk factor, such as a change in the value of a Treasury bill for a one-basis-point change in interest rates. Citigroups independent market risk management ensures that factor sensitivities are calculated, monitored and, in most cases, limited, for all relevant risks taken in a trading portfolio. VAR estimates the potential decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal market conditions. The VAR method incorporates the factor sensitivities of the trading portfolio with the volatilities and correlations of those factors and is expressed as the risk to the Company over a one-day holding period, at a 99% confidence level. Citigroups VAR is based on the volatilities of and correlations among a multitude of market risk factors as well as factors that track the specific issuer risk in debt and equity securities. Stress testing is performed on trading portfolios on a regular basis to estimate the impact of extreme market movements. It is performed on both individual trading portfolios, and on aggregations of portfolios and businesses. Independent market risk management, in conjunction with the businesses, develops stress scenarios, reviews the output of periodic stress testing exercises, and uses the information to make judgments as to the ongoing appropriateness of exposure levels and limits. Each trading portfolio has its own market risk limit framework encompassing these measures and other controls, including permitted product lists and a new product approval process for complex products. 73 Table of Contents Total revenues of the trading business consist of:  customer revenue, which includes spreads from customer flow and positions taken to facilitate customer orders;  proprietary trading activities in both cash and derivative transactions; and  net interest revenue. All trading positions are marked to market, with the result reflected in earnings. In 2008, negative trading-related revenue (net losses) was recorded for 109 of 260 trading days. Of the 109 days on which negative revenue (net losses) was recorded, 21 were greater than $400 million. The following histogram of total daily revenue or loss captures trading volatility and shows the number of days in which the Companys trading-related revenues fell within particular ranges. Citigroup periodically performs extensive back-testing of many hypothetical test portfolios as one check of the accuracy of its VAR. Back-testing is the process in which the daily VAR of a portfolio is compared to the actual daily change in the market value of its transactions. Back-testing is conducted to confirm that the daily market value losses in excess of a 99% confidence level occur, on average, only 1% of the time. The VAR calculation for the hypothetical test portfolios, with different degrees of risk concentration, meets this statistical criteria. The level of price risk exposure at any given point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements, and will vary from period to period. For Citigroups major trading centers, the aggregate pretax VAR in the trading portfolios was $319 million at December 31, 2008 and $191 million at December 31, 2007. Daily exposures averaged $292 million in 2008 and ranged from $220 million to $393 million. The Subprime Group (SPG) exposures became fully integrated into VAR during the first quarter of 2008. As a result, December 31, 2008 VAR and 2008 average VAR increased by approximately $29 million and $111 million, respectively. 74 Table of Contents The following table summarizes VAR to Citigroup in the trading portfolios as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, including the total VAR, the specific risk-only component of VAR, and totalgeneral market factors only, along with the yearly averages: In millions of dollars Dec. 31, 2008 2008 average Dec. 31, 2007 2007 average Interest rate $ 320 $ 280 $ 89 $ 98 Foreign exchange 118 54 28 29 Equity 84 99 150 96 Commodity 15 34 45 35 Covariance adjustment (218 ) (175 ) (121 ) (116 ) Totalall market risk factors, including general and specific risk $ 319 $ 292 $ 191 $ 142 Specific risk-only component $ 8 $ 21 $ 28 $ 19 Totalgeneral market factors only $ 311 $ 271 $ 163 $ 123 The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and debt issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR.

It includes the reputation and franchise risk associated with business practices or market conduct in which the Company is involved. Operational risk is inherent in Citigroups global business activities and, as with other risk types, is managed through an overall framework designed to balance strong corporate oversight with well-defined independent risk management. This framework includes:  recognized ownership of the risk by the businesses;  oversight by independent risk management; and  independent review by Audit and Risk Review (ARR). The goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to the characteristics of our businesses, the markets in which we operate, our capital and liquidity, and the competitive, economic and regulatory environment. Notwithstanding these controls, Citigroup incurs operational losses. Framework To monitor, mitigate and control operational risk, Citigroup maintains a system of comprehensive policies and has established a consistent, value-added framework for assessing and communicating operational risk and the overall effectiveness of the internal control environment across Citigroup. An Operational Risk Council has been established to provide oversight for operational risk across Citigroup. The Councils membership includes senior members of the Chief Risk Officers organization covering multiple dimensions of risk management with representatives of the Business and Regional Chief Risk Officers organizations and the Business Management Group. The Councils focus is on further advancing operational risk management at Citigroup with focus on proactive identification and mitigation of operational risk and related incidents. The Council works with the business segments and the control functions to help ensure a transparent, consistent and comprehensive framework for managing operational risk globally. Each major business segment must implement an operational risk process consistent with the requirements of this framework. The process for operational risk management includes the following steps:  identify and assess key operational risks;  establish key risk indicators;  produce a comprehensive operational risk report; and  prioritize and assure adequate resources to actively improve the operational risk environment and mitigate emerging risks. The operational risk standards facilitate the effective communication and mitigation of operational risk both within and across businesses. As new products and business activities are developed, processes are designed, modified or sourced through alternative means and operational risks are considered. Information about the businesses operational risk, historical losses, and the control environment is reported by each major business segment and functional area, and summarized for Senior Management and the Citigroup Board of Directors. Measurement and Basel II To support advanced capital modeling and management, the businesses are required to capture relevant operational risk capital information. An enhanced version of the risk capital model for operational risk has been developed and implemented across the major business segments as a step toward readiness for Basel II capital calculations. The risk capital calculation is designed to qualify as an Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) under Basel II. It uses a combination of internal and external loss data to support statistical modeling of capital requirement estimates, which are then adjusted to reflect qualitative data regarding the operational risk and control environment. Information Security and Continuity of Business Information security and the protection of confidential and sensitive customer data are a priority of Citigroup. The Company has implemented an Information Security Program that complies with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and other regulatory guidance. The Information Security Program is reviewed and enhanced periodically to address emerging threats to customers information. The Corporate Office of Business Continuity, with the support of Senior Management, continues to coordinate global preparedness and mitigate business continuity risks by reviewing and testing recovery procedures. 76 Table of Contents COUNTRY AND FFIEC CROSS-BORDER RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Country Risk Country risk is the risk that an event in a foreign country will impair the value of Citigroup assets or will adversely affect the ability of obligors within that country to honor their obligations to Citigroup. Country risk events may include sovereign defaults, banking or currency crises, social instability, and changes in governmental policies (for example, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and other changes in legislation relating to international ownership). Country risk includes local franchise risk, credit risk, market risk, operational risk and cross-border risk. The country risk management framework at Citigroup includes a number of tools and management processes designed to facilitate the ongoing analysis of individual countries and their risks. These include country risk rating models, scenario planning and stress testing, internal watch lists, and the Country Risk Committee process. The Citigroup Country Risk Committee is the senior forum to evaluate the Companys total business footprint within a specific country franchise with emphasis on responses to current potential country risk events. The Committee is chaired by the Head of Global Country Risk Management and includes as its members senior risk management officers, senior regional business heads, and senior product heads. The Committee regularly reviews all risk exposures within a country, makes recommendations as to actions, and follows up to ensure appropriate accountability. Cross-Border Risk Cross-border risk is the risk that actions taken by a non-U.S. government may prevent the conversion of local currency into non-local currency and/or the transfer of funds outside the country, thereby impacting the ability of the Company and its customers to transact business across borders. Examples of cross-border risk include actions taken by foreign governments such as exchange controls, debt moratoria, or restrictions on the remittance of funds. These actions might restrict the transfer of funds or the ability of the Company to obtain payment from customers on their contractual obligations. Management oversight of cross-border risk is performed through a formal review process that includes annual setting of cross-border limits, ongoing monitoring of cross-border exposures, as well as monitoring of economic conditions globally and the establishment of internal cross-border risk management policies. Under Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) regulatory guidelines, total reported cross-border outstandings include cross-border claims on third parties, as well as investments in and funding of local franchises. Cross-border claims on third parties (trade and short-, medium- and long-term claims) include cross-border loans, securities, deposits with banks, investments in affiliates, and other monetary assets, as well as net revaluation gains on foreign exchange and derivative products. Cross-border outstandings are reported based on the country of the obligor or guarantor. Outstandings backed by cash collateral are assigned to the country in which the collateral is held. For securities received as collateral, cross-border outstandings are reported in the domicile of the issuer of the securities. Cross-border resale agreements are presented based on the domicile of the counterparty in accordance with FFIEC guidelines. Investments in and funding of local franchises represent the excess of local country assets over local country liabilities. Local country assets are claims on local residents recorded by branches and majority-owned subsidiaries of Citigroup domiciled in the country, adjusted for externally guaranteed claims and certain collateral. Local country liabilities are obligations of non-U.S. branches and majority-owned subsidiaries of Citigroup for which no cross-border guarantee has been issued by another Citigroup office. The table below shows all countries in which total FFIEC cross-border outstandings exceed 0.75% of total Citigroup assets: December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Cross-border claims on third parties In billions of dollars U.S. Banks Public Private Total Trading andshort-term claims (1) Investments in and funding of local franchises Total cross-border outstandings Commitments (2) Total cross-border outstandings Commitments (2) Germany $ 11.7 $ 2.4 $ 4.2 $ 18.3 $ 16.6 $ 11.6 $ 29.9 $ 40.7 $ 29.3 $ 46.4 India 0.7  7.1 7.8 4.9 20.2 28.0 1.6 39.0 1.7 United Kingdom 15.2  11.1 26.3 24.0  26.3 196.0 24.7 366.0 Cayman Islands 0.4 0.1 21.6 22.1 20.7  22.1 8.1 9.0 6.9 Korea 2.1 1.1 1.4 4.6 4.4 17.4 22.0 15.7 21.9 22.0 France 10.9 2.9 7.4 21.2 17.5 0.2 21.4 55.8 24.3 107.8 Netherlands 5.2 1.1 11.4 17.7 11.4  17.7 57.0 23.1 20.2 Canada 1.2 0.5 4.7 6.4 5.3 9.7 16.1 35.9 15.3 55.8 Italy 1.5 7.8 2.0 11.3 9.2 3.4 14.7 16.4 18.8 5.1 (1) Included in total cross-border claims on third parties.

Loans vary across regions and industries and primarily include credit cards, mortgages, other real estate lending, personal loans, auto loans, student loans, and corporate loans. The majority of loans are carried at cost with a minimal amount recorded at fair value in accordance with SFAS 155 and SFAS 159. Consumer and corporate loans comprised 75% and 25%, respectively, of total loans (net of unearned income and before the allowance for loan losses). During 2008 consumer loans decreased by $83 billion, or 14%, primarily due to:  $39 billion, or 14%, decrease in installment and revolving credit; and  $29 billion, or 10%, decrease in mortgage and real estate loans. These decreases were partially driven by the sales of CitiCapital and the German retail banking units. Foreign exchange translation also factored into the decrease in loans, as a number of currencies weakened against the dollar. During 2008 corporate loans decreased $15 billion, or 8%, primarily driven by a decrease of $10 billion, or 7%, in commercial and industrial loans. During 2008, average consumer loans (net of unearned income) of $551 billion yielded an average rate of 8.6%, compared to $523 billion and 9.0% in the prior year. Average corporate loans of $184 billion yielded an average rate of 8.2% in 2008, compared to $188 billion and 8.5% in the prior year. For further information, see Loans Outstanding on page 53 and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 162. Trading Account Assets (Liabilities) Trading account assets include debt and marketable equity securities, derivatives in a receivable position, residual interests in securitizations, and physical commodities inventory. In addition, certain assets that Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value under SFAS 155 and SFAS 159, such as certain loans and purchase guarantees, are also included in trading account assets. Trading account liabilities include securities sold, not yet purchased (short positions) and derivatives in a net payable position as well as certain liabilities that Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value under SFAS 155 and SFAS 159. All trading account assets and liabilities are reported at their fair value, except for physical commodities inventory which is carried at the lower of cost or market, with unrealized gains and losses recognized in current income. During 2008 trading account assets decreased by $161 billion, or 30%, due to:  $127 billion, or 70%, decrease in corporate and other debt securities, driven by a decrease in the SIV assets, a decrease in commercial paper trading assets and the transfer of trading assets to investments held-to-maturity and available-for-sale (see Reclassification of Financial Assets on page 87);  $58 billion, or 55%, decrease in equity securities;  $35 billion, or 62%, decrease in mortgage loans and collateralized mortgage securities (CMOs); and  $9 billion, or 49%, decrease in state and municipal securities; offset by:  $38 billion, or 50%, increase in revaluation gains primarily consisting of increases from interest rates, foreign exchange and credit derivative contracts, offset by an increase in netting permitted under master netting agreements; 78 Table of Contents  $12 billion, or 38%, increase in U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities;  $5 billion, or 10%, increase in foreign government securities; and  $13 billion, or 85%, net increase in other trading securities. Total average trading account assets were $381 billion in 2008, compared to $441 billion in 2007, yielding average rates of 4.6% and 4.2%, respectively. During 2008 trading account liabilities decreased by $15 billion, or 8%, due to:  $13 billion, or 13%, increase in revaluation losses primarily consisting of increases from interest rates, foreign exchange and credit derivative contracts, offset by an increase in netting permitted under master netting agreements; and  $28 billion, or 35%, decrease in securities sold, not yet purchased, comprising a $28 billion decrease in debt securities, while U.S. Treasury securities remained flat. In 2008, average trading account liabilities were $76 billion, yielding an average rate of 1.7%, compared to $105 billion and 1.4% in the prior year. For further discussion regarding trading account assets and liabilities, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 156. Federal Funds Sold (Purchased) and Securities Borrowed (Loaned) or Purchased (Sold) Under Agreements to Resell (Repurchase) Federal funds sold and federal funds purchased consist of unsecured advances of excess balances in reserve accounts held at Federal Reserve banks. When the Company advances federal funds to a third party, it is selling its excess reserves. Similarly, when the Company receives federal funds, the Company is purchasing reserves from a third party. These interest-bearing transactions typically have an original maturity of one business day. Securities borrowed and securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received, with a minimal amount adjusted for fair value in accordance with SFAS 159. With respect to securities borrowed, the Company pays cash collateral in an amount in excess of the market value of securities borrowed, and receives excess in the case of securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral advanced or obtained as necessary. Interest received or paid for these transactions is recorded in interest income or interest expense. Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are primarily carried at fair value in accordance with SFAS 159 since January 1, 2007. In prior periods, these agreements were carried at cost. The Companys policy is to take possession of securities purchased under agreements to resell. The market value of securities to be repurchased and resold is monitored, and additional collateral is obtained where appropriate to protect against credit exposure. During 2008 the decrease of $90 billion, or 33%, in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, and the decrease of $99 billion, or 33%, in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase were primarily driven by balance sheet management. For further information regarding these balance sheet categories, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 155. Investments Investments consist of debt and equity securities that are available-for-sale, debt securities that are held-to-maturity, non-marketable equity securities that are carried at fair value, and non-marketable equity securities carried at cost. Debt securities include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stock, as well as loan-backed securities (such as mortgage-backed securities) and other structured notes. Marketable and non-marketable equity securities carried at fair value include common and nonredeemable preferred stocks. These instruments provide the Company with long-term investment opportunities while in most cases remaining relatively liquid. Non-marketable equity securities carried at cost primarily include equity shares issued by the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank that the Company is required to hold. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale are primarily carried at fair value with the changes in fair value generally recognized in stockholders equity (accumulated other comprehensive income). Declines in fair value that are deemed other-than-temporary, as well as gains and losses from the sale of these investment securities, are recognized in current earnings. Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities and certain investments that would otherwise be accounted for using the equity method are carried at fair value in accordance with SFAS 159. Changes in fair value of such investments are recorded in earnings. Debt securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at cost unless a decline in fair value below cost is deemed other-than-temporary, in which case such a decline is recorded in current earnings. During 2008, investments increased by $41 billion, or 19%, principally due to the transfer of debt securities from Trading assets to Investments as discussed in the section Reclassification of Financial Assets on page 87. For further information regarding investments, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 157. Other Assets Other assets are composed of cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, brokerage receivables, goodwill, intangibles, and various other assets. During 2008, other assets increased $58 billion, or 15%, due to the $101 billion increase in deposits with banks and the $31 billion increase in the deferred tax asset. These increases were offset by the following decreases:  $41 billion related to loans held-for-sale as they were reclassed to loans held-for-investment (for further discussion, see Reclassification of Financial Assets on page 87);  $17 billion in goodwill and intangibles, driven by the impairment of goodwill and intangibles, foreign exchange translation and the decrease in the fair value of the MSR;  $13 billion in brokerage receivables; and  $3 billion in various other assets. For further information regarding goodwill and intangibles, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 165. For further discussion on brokerage receivables, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 156. Deposits Deposits represent customer funds that are payable on demand or upon maturity. The majority of deposits are carried at cost, with a minimal amount recorded at fair value in accordance with SFAS 155 and SFAS 159. 79 Table of Contents Deposits can be interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing. Interest-bearing deposits payable by foreign and U.S. domestic banking subsidiaries of the Company comprise 58% and 29% of total deposits, respectively, while non-interest-bearing deposits comprise 5% and 8% of total deposits, respectively. During 2008 total deposits decreased by $52 billion, or 6%, primarily due to:  the sale of the German retail banking units; and  lower international deposits, mostly driven by FX and the higher funding costs which led to customers using their excess cash reserves deposited with Citi. Average deposits increased $5 billion to $695 billion in 2008, yielding an average rate of 2.9%, compared to 4.1% in the prior year. For more information on deposits, see Capital Resources and Liquidity on page 94. Debt Debt is composed of both short-term and long-term borrowings. It includes commercial paper, borrowings from unaffiliated banks, senior notes (including collateralized advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank), subordinated notes and trust preferred securities. The majority of debt is carried at cost, with approximately $45 billion recorded at fair value in accordance with SFAS 155 and SFAS 159. During 2008, total debt decreased by $88 billion, or 15%, with short-term borrowings decreasing by $20 billion, or 14%, and long-term debt decreasing by $68 billion, or 16%. The decrease in short-term borrowings was due to a decline of $12 billion in other funds borrowed and $8 billion in commercial paper primarily due to illiquid credit markets. Average commercial paper outstanding in 2008 was $34 billion and yielded an average rate of 3.1%, compared to $45 billion and 5.2% in 2007. Average other funds borrowed in 2008 were $87 billion, yielding an average rate of 1.7%, compared to $95 billion and 2.8% in the prior year. The decrease in long- and short-term debt is driven by decreased funding needs, as well as the issuance of preferred stock during the year. As the balance sheet has decreased in size, the funding needs of the Company have decreased. Average long-term debt outstanding during 2008 was $348 billion, compared to $303 billion in 2007, yielding an average rate of 4.6% and 5.3%, respectively. For more information on debt, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 168 and Capital Resources and Liquidity on page 94. 80 Table of Contents SEGMENT BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 In millions of dollars GlobalCards Consumer Banking ICG GlobalWealthManagement Corporate/Other& ConsolidatingEliminations Total CitigroupConsolidated Assets: Cash and due from banks $ 1,136 $ 8,683 $ 17,599 $ 1,103 $ 732 $ 29,253 Deposits with banks 535 12,030 34,250 2,016 121,500 170,331 Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell  719 178,759 4,655  184,133 Brokerage receivables  2 30,613 13,663  44,278 Trading account assets 8,737 11,780 344,609 10,755 1,754 377,635 Investments 450 46,984 144,413 244 63,929 256,020 Loans, net of unearned income Consumer 90,562 373,542  55,545 24 519,673 Corporate   174,455  88 174,543 Loans, net of unearned income $ 90,562 $ 373,542 $ 174,455 $ 55,545 $ 112 $ 694,216 Allowance for loan losses (6,932 ) (14,950 ) (7,250 ) (484 )  (29,616 ) Total loans, net $ 83,630 $ 358,592 $ 167,205 $ 55,061 $ 112 $ 664,600 Goodwill 10,832 3,106 11,344 1,850  27,132 Intangible assets 6,696 7,085 2,730 3,299 6 19,816 Other assets 1,797 47,572 71,506 6,801 37,596 165,272 Total assets $ 113,813 $ 496,553 $ 1,003,028 $ 99,447 $ 225,629 $ 1,938,470 Liabilities and equity: Total deposits $ 1,133 $ 281,774 $ 368,421 $ 104,398 $ 18,459 $ 774,185 Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase  4,515 195,406 5,025 347 205,293 Brokerage payables   63,446 7,470  70,916 Trading account liabilities  127 162,636 3,737 978 167,478 Short-term borrowings  1,435 59,386 14,540 51,330 126,691 Long-term debt 242 15,320 76,130 1,051 266,850 359,593 Other liabilities 28,751 83,998 101,766 36,815 (158,646 ) 92,684 Net inter-segment funding (lending) 83,687 109,384 (24,163 ) (73,589 ) (95,319 )  Stockholders equity     141,630 141,630 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 113,813 $ 496,553 $ 1,003,028 $ 99,447 $ 225,629 $ 1,938,470 The above supplemental information reflects the Companys consolidated GAAP balance sheet by reporting segment as of December 31, 2008. The respective segment information closely depicts the assets and liabilities managed by each segment as of such date. While this presentation is not defined by GAAP, the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors understanding of the balance sheet components managed by the underlying business segments as well as the beneficial interrelationship of the asset and liability dynamics of the balance sheet components among the Companys business segments. The Company believes that investors may find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance. 81 Table of Contents Interest Revenue/Expense and Yields In millions of dollars 2008 2007 (1) 2006 (1) % Change 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 Interest revenue (2) $ 106,655 $ 121,429 $ 93,611 (12 )% 30 % Interest expense (3) 52,963 76,051 55,683 (30 ) 37 Net interest revenue (2) (3) $ 53,692 $ 45,378 $ 37,928 18 % 20 % Interest revenueaverage rate 6.09 % 6.44 % 6.43 % (35 )bps 1 bps Interest expenseaverage rate 3.28 % 4.44 % 4.28 % (116 )bps 16 bps Net interest margin 3.06 % 2.41 % 2.60 % 65 bps (19 )bps Interest-rate benchmarks: Federal Funds rateend of period 0.000.25 % 4.25 % 5.25 % (400+ )bps (100 )bps Federal Funds rateaverage rate 2.08 % 5.05 % 4.96 % (297 )bps 9 bps 2-year U.S. Treasury noteaverage rate 2.01 % 4.36 % 4.81 % (235 )bps (45 )bps 10-year U.S. Treasury noteaverage rate 3.66 % 4.63 % 4.79 % (97 )bps (16 )bps 10-year vs. 2-year spread 165 bps 27 bps (2 )bps (1) Reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation and to exclude discontinued operations. (2) Excludes taxable equivalent adjustments (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%) of $323 million, $125 million, and $98 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. (3) Excludes expenses associated with hybrid financial instruments and beneficial interest in consolidated VIEs. These obligations are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value with changes recorded in Principal transactions. In addition, the majority of the funding provided by Treasury to CitiCapital operations is excluded from this line. A significant portion of the Companys business activities is based upon gathering deposits and borrowing money and then lending or investing those funds. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing gross interest revenue less gross interest expense by average interest earning assets. Net interest margin improved during 2008, mainly due to the lower cost of funds, reflecting the decreases in the Fed Funds rate as well as lower rates outside the U.S. The lower cost of funds more than offset the decrease in the asset yields, resulting in an 18% increase in net interest revenue in 2008 when compared to 2007. The Companys deleveraging actions had a positive impact by reducing the amount of lower yielding assets on the Companys balance sheet. On the asset side, the average yield primarily reflects a decline in the yields on the loan portfolio, Investments and Fed Funds sold. On the liability side, the yields on deposits decreased domestically, as well as internationally. The lower yields on short-term borrowing and Fed Funds purchased further contributed to the downward movement of the yield on interest-bearing liabilities. The widening between short-term and long-term spreads also contributed to the upward movement of the net interest margin. 82 Table of Contents AVERAGE BALANCES AND INTEREST RATESASSETS (1)(2)(3)(4) Average volume Interest revenue % Average rate In millions of dollars 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Assets Deposits with banks (5) $ 78,788 $ 54,840 $ 35,770 $ 3,119 $ 3,113 $ 2,240 3.96 % 5.68 % 6.26 % Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell (6) In U.S. offices $ 164,732 $ 192,824 $ 166,202 $ 5,071 $ 11,728 $ 10,258 3.08 % 6.08 % 6.17 % In offices outside the U.S. (5) 77,324 131,766 85,200 4,104 6,626 3,941 5.31 5.03 4.63 Total $ 242,056 $ 324,590 $ 251,402 $ 9,175 $ 18,354 $ 14,199 3.79 % 5.65 % 5.65 % Trading account assets (7) (8) In U.S. offices $ 221,455 $ 263,922 $ 188,985 $ 12,331 $ 13,557 $ 8,537 5.57 % 5.14 % 4.52 % In offices outside the U.S. (5) 159,194 176,803 100,634 5,158 4,950 3,328 3.24 2.80 3.31 Total $ 380,649 $ 440,725 $ 289,619 $ 17,489 $ 18,507 $ 11,865 4.59 % 4.20 % 4.10 % Investments In U.S. offices Taxable $ 112,071 $ 136,482 $ 106,136 $ 4,846 $ 6,840 $ 4,799 4.32 % 5.01 % 4.52 % Exempt from U.S. income tax (1) 13,584 17,796 14,023 613 909 661 4.51 5.11 4.71 In offices outside the U.S. (5) 95,308 108,875 96,757 5,259 5,674 4,880 5.52 5.21 5.04 Total $ 220,963 $ 263,153 $ 216,916 $ 10,718 $ 13,423 $ 10,340 4.85 % 5.10 % 4.77 % Loans (net of unearned income) (9) Consumer loans In U.S. offices $ 373,095 $ 364,220 $ 328,311 $ 28,657 $ 30,491 $ 27,499 7.68 % 8.37 % 8.38 % In offices outside the U.S. (5) 177,461 159,004 124,120 18,633 16,782 13,034 10.50 10.55 10.50 Total consumer loans $ 550,556 $ 523,224 $ 452,431 $ 47,290 $ 47,273 $ 40,533 8.59 % 9.03 % 8.96 % Corporate loans In U.S. offices $ 43,773 $ 34,843 $ 28,113 $ 2,281 $ 2,398 $ 1,717 5.21 % 6.88 % 6.11 % In offices outside the U.S. (5) 140,196 152,840 124,462 12,765 13,530 9,836 9.11 8.85 7.90 Total corporate loans $ 183,969 $ 187,683 $ 152,575 $ 15,046 $ 15,928 $ 11,553 8.18 % 8.49 % 7.57 % Total loans $ 734,525 $ 710,907 $ 605,006 $ 62,336 $ 63,201 $ 52,086 8.49 % 8.89 % 8.61 % Other interest-earning assets $ 95,253 $ 90,707 $ 57,470 $ 3,818 $ 4,831 $ 2,881 4.01 % 5.33 % 5.01 % Total interest-earning assets $ 1,752,234 $ 1,884,922 $ 1,456,183 $ 106,655 $ 121,429 $ 93,611 6.09 % 6.44 % 6.43 % Non-interest-earning assets (7) 387,876 249,960 187,797 Total assets from discontinued operations 27,368 36,650 35,414 Total assets $ 2,167,478 $ 2,171,532 $ 1,679,394 (1) Interest revenue excludes the taxable equivalent adjustments (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%) of $323 million, $125 million, and $98 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

The Company believes that the expected cash flows to be generated from holding the assets significantly exceed their current fair value which has been significantly adversely impacted by the reduced liquidity in the global financial markets. As such, the Company anticipates returns on these assets will be optimized by holding them for extended periods or until maturity, rather than through an exit strategy in the short term. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company reclassified certain debt securities and loans into accounting categories with measurement based on amortized cost to align the accounting treatment with the revised asset holding periods. Debt Securities Reclassified to Available for Sale and Held to Maturity FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS 115), requires that, at acquisition, an enterprise classify debt securities into one of three categories: trading, available for sale (AFS) or held to maturity (HTM). Trading securities are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with unrealized holding gains and losses recognized in earnings currently. AFS securities are carried at fair value on the balance sheet, and unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and recognized as a separate component of equity in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). HTM debt securities are measured at amortized cost. Both AFS and HTM are subject to review for other-than-temporary impairment (see discussion on page 128). SFAS 115 states that transfers of securities out of the trading category are expected to be rare. During the fourth quarter of 2008, Citigroup made a number of transfers out of the trading category in order to better reflect the revised intentions of the Company in response to the significant deterioration in market conditions, which was especially acute during the fourth quarter. These market conditions were not foreseen at the initial purchase date of the securities. Most of the debt securities previously classified as trading were bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the short term, many in the context of Citigroups acting as a market maker. At the date of acquisition, most of these positions were liquid and the Company expected active and frequent buying and selling with the objective of generating profits on short-term differences in price. However, subsequent declines in value of these securities are primarily related to the ongoing widening of market credit spreads reflecting increased risk and liquidity premiums that buyers are currently demanding. As market liquidity has decreased, the primary buyers for these securities have typically demanded a return on investment that is significantly higher than previously experienced. Despite depressed market prices, the Company determined through credit analysis that the cash recovery levels of these securities is expected to be significantly higher than current market prices might indicate. 87 Table of Contents Reclassifications of debt securities were made at fair value on the date of transfer. The impact of the transfers executed during the fourth quarter of 2008 is detailed in the following table followed by a, summarized by type of securities: In millions of dollars Carrying value atDecember 31, 2008 Debt securities reclassified from Trading account assets to held-to-maturity investment $ 33,258 Debt securities reclassified from available-for-sale investments to held-to-maturity investments 27,005 Total debt securities reclassified to held-to-maturity investments $ 60,263 Debt and equity securities reclassified from Trading account assets to available-for-sale investments $ 4,654 In millions of dollars Amortized cost(1) Carrying value atDecember 31,2008(2) Fair value atDecember 31,2008(2) Debt securities reclassified to held-to-maturity investments Mortgage-backed securities $ 37,719 $ 30,738 $ 27,751 State and municipal 4,898 4,548 4,327 Other debt securities 25,665 24,977 24,432 Total debt securities reclassified to held-to-maturity investments $ 68,282 $ 60,263 $ 56,510 Debt and equity securities reclassified to available-for-sale investments Mortgage-backed securities $ 109 $ 72 $ 72 State and municipal 2,235 2,111 2,111 Other debt and equity securities 2,368 2,471 2,471 Total debt and equity securities reclassified to available-for-sale investments $ 4,712 $ 4,654 $ 4,654 (1) For securities transferred to held-to-maturity from Trading account assets, amortized cost is defined as the fair value amount of the securities at the date of transfer. For securities transferred to held-to-maturity from available-for-sale, amortized cost is defined as the original purchase cost, plus or minus any accretion or amortization of interest, less any impairment previously recognized in earnings. (2) The difference between the carrying value and fair value at December 31, 2008 for those securities reclassified to HTM is not recognized in the Companys financial statements, while the difference for securities reclassified from Trading account assets to AFS is recognized with the change recorded in AOCI. (3) Excluded from these tables is $4.2 billion of HTM securities that were purchased during the fourth quarter of 2008, in accordance with prior commitments. These purchases consisted of $1.3 billion of auction-rate securities and $2.9 billion of auto note securities. The net unrealized losses arising prior to the reclassification date and classified in AOCI of $8.0 billion as of December 31, 2008, for debt securities reclassified from AFS investments to HTM investments have been segregated within AOCI. This balance will be amortized over the remaining life of the related securities as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the accretion of discount on the same transferred debt securities. This will have no impact on the Companys net income because the amortization of the unrealized holding loss reported in equity will offset the effect on the interest income of the accretion of the discount on these securities. 88 Table of Contents Loans Reclassified to Held for Investment FASB Statement No. 65, Accounting for Certain Mortgage Banking Activities (SFAS 65), and AICPA Statement of Position 01-6, Accounting by Certain Entities (Including Entities with Trade Receivables) That Lend to or Finance the Activities of Others (SOP 01-6), require that the accounting for a loan be based upon the Companys intent and ability to hold the loan for the foreseeable future or until maturity. Loans that the Company has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff, should be classified as held for investment (HFI) and reported in the balance sheet at the amortized cost of the loan, adjusted by the allowance for loan losses. Loans that the Company intends to sell should be classified as held for sale (HFS) and reported at the lower of cost or fair value. During the fourth quarter of 2008, Citigroup made a number of transfers from the HFS category to the HFI category to better reflect prevailing intentions of the Company. Reclassifications of loans were made at fair value on the date of transfer. The impact of the transfers executed during the fourth quarter of 2008 is detailed in the following table, summarized by type of loan: Fair valueat date of transfer Carrying value atDecember 31, 2008 Fair value atDecember 31, 2008 Loans reclassified to held for investment Highly leveraged loans $ 3,318 $ 3,350 $ 1,650 Commercial real estate loans 7,150 7,049 7,110 Other loans 5,241 5,492 5,523 Total loans $ 15,709 $ 15,891 $ 14,283 Loan balances reclassified relate to funded positions that were originated as part of a strategy to distribute. Prior to the recent dislocation in the credit markets, Citigroup managed the risk associated with these loans by seeking to sell a majority of its exposure to the market prior to, or shortly after, funding. For the reasons discussed under Debt Securities Reclassified to Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity on page 87, the Company believes that the best value can now be obtained through a hold strategy. It is now the Companys intention to hold these positions for the foreseeable future, which is considered to be such time as the loan period expires, or sufficient liquidity returns to the market place, such that the loans can be sold for a value which the Company believes is representative of the implicit credit risk of the position. Due to the severity and duration of current unfavorable market conditions, the Company does not anticipate such liquidity returning in the foreseeable future, which for these loans the Company generally defines to be within the next year. The loans reclassified to HFI are assessed for intention to hold on an individual loan basis. After transfer, HFI loans are now subject to the Companys allowance for loan loss review process. 89 Table of Contents DERIVATIVES Presented below are the notional and the mark-to-market receivables and payables for Citigroups derivative exposures as of December 31, 2008 and 2007: Notionals (1) In millions of dollars Trading derivatives (2) Non-trading derivatives (5) As of December 31 2008 2007 2008 2007 Interest rate contracts Swaps $ 15,096,293 $ 16,433,117 $ 763,630 $ 521,783 Futures and forwards 2,619,952 1,811,599 118,440 176,146 Written options 2,963,280 3,479,071 25,255 16,741 Purchased options 3,067,443 3,639,075 38,344 167,080 Total interest rate contract notionals $ 23,746,968 $ 25,362,862 $ 945,669 $ 881,750 Foreign exchange contracts Swaps $ 882,327 $ 1,062,267 $ 62,491 $ 75,622 Futures and forwards 2,165,377 2,795,180 40,694 46,732 Written options 483,036 653,535 3,286 292 Purchased options 539,164 644,744 676 686 Total foreign exchange contract notionals $ 4,069,904 $ 5,155,726 $ 107,147 $ 123,332 Equity contracts Swaps $ 98,315 $ 140,256 $  $  Futures and forwards 17,390 29,233   Written options 507,327 625,157   Purchased options 471,532 567,030   Total equity contract notionals $ 1,094,564 $ 1,361,676 $  $  Commodity and other contracts Swaps $ 44,020 $ 29,415 $  $  Futures and forwards 60,625 66,860   Written options 31,395 27,087   Purchased options 32,892 30,168   Total commodity and other contract notionals $ 168,932 $ 153,530 $  $  Credit derivatives (4) Citigroup as the Guarantor: Credit default swaps $ 1,441,117 $ 1,755,440 $  $  Total return swaps 1,905 12,121   Credit default options 258 276   Citigroup as the Beneficiary:  Credit default swaps 1,560,087 1,890,611   Total return swaps 29,990 15,895   Credit default options 135 450   Total credit derivatives $ 3,033,492 $ 3,674,793 Total derivative notionals $ 32,113,860 $ 35,708,587 $ 1,052,816 $ 1,005,082 See the following page for footnotes. 90 Table of Contents Mark-to-Market (MTM) Receivables/Payables In millions of dollars Derivatives receivablesMTM Derivatives payablesMTM As of December 31 2008 2007 (6) 2008 2007 (6) Trading derivatives (2) Interest rate contracts $ 667,597 $ 237,711 $ 654,178 $ 237,903 Foreign exchange contracts 153,197 77,937 160,628 71,980 Equity contracts 35,717 27,381 57,292 66,916 Commodity and other contracts 23,924 8,540 22,473 8,887 Credit derivatives: (4) Citigroup as the Guarantor 5,890 4,967 198,233 73,103 Citigroup as the Beneficiary 222,461 78,426 5,476 11,191 Cash collateral paid/received (3) 63,866 32,247 65,010 19,437 Total $ 1,172,652 $ 467,209 $ 1,163,290 $ 489,417 Less: Netting agreements and market value adjustments (1,057,363 ) (390,328 ) (1,046,505 ) (385,876 ) Net receivables/payables $ 115,289 $ 76,881 $ 116,785 $ 103,541 Non-trading derivatives (5) Interest rate contracts $ 14,755 $ 8,529 $ 7,742 $ 7,176 Foreign exchange contracts 2,408 1,634 3,746 972 Total $ 17,163 $ 10,163 $ 11,488 $ 8,148 (1) Includes the notional amounts for long and short derivative positions.

(3) In addition to the cash collateral paid or received, as of December 31, 2008 the Company has provided $7.9 billion and received $6.8 billion of marketable securities as collateral under derivative contracts. (4) Credit derivatives are arrangements designed to allow one party (the beneficiary) to transfer the credit risk of a reference asset to another party (the guarantor). These arrangements allow a guarantor to assume the credit risk associated with the reference asset without directly purchasing it. The Company has entered into credit derivatives positions for purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement, reduction of credit concentrations and diversification of overall risk. (5) Non-trading derivatives include only those end-user derivative instruments where the changes in market value are recorded in Other assets or Other liabilities.

Derivative Obligor Information The following table presents the global derivatives portfolio by internal obligor credit rating at December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a percentage of credit exposure: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 AAA/AA/A 68 % 80 % BBB 20 11 BB/B 7 7 CCC or below 5 1 Unrated  1 Total 100 % 100 % The following table presents the global derivatives portfolio by industry of the obligor as a percentage of credit exposure: 2008 2007 Financial institutions 73 % 75 % Governments 7 6 Corporations 20 19 Total 100 % 100 % Fair Valuation Adjustments for Derivatives The fair value adjustments applied by the Company to its derivative carrying values consist of the following items:  Liquidity adjustments are applied to items in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair-value hierarchy (see Note 26 on page 191 for more details) to ensure that the fair value reflects the price at which the entire position could be liquidated. The liquidity reserve is based on the bid/offer spread for an instrument, adjusted to take into account the size of the position.  Credit valuation adjustments (CVA) are applied to over-the-counter derivative instruments, in which the base valuation generally discounts expected cash flows using LIBOR interest rate curves. Because not all counterparties have the same credit risk as that implied by the relevant LIBOR curve, a CVA is necessary to incorporate the market view of both counterparty credit risk and the Companys own credit risk in the valuation. The Companys CVA methodology comprises two steps. First, the exposure profile for each counterparty is determined using the terms of all individual derivative positions and a Monte Carlo simulation or other quantitative analysis to generate a series of expected cash flows at future points in time. The calculation of this exposure profile considers the effect of credit risk mitigants, including pledged cash or other collateral and any legal right of offset that exists with a counterparty through arrangements such as netting agreements. Individual derivative contracts that are subject to an enforceable master netting agreement with a counterparty are aggregated for this purpose, since it is those aggregate net cash flows that are subject to nonperformance risk. This process identifies specific, point in time future cash flows that are subject to nonperformance risk, rather than using the current recognized net asset or liability as a basis to measure the CVA. Second, market-based views of default probabilities derived from observed credit spreads in the credit default swap market, are applied to the expected 91 Table of Contents future cash flows determined in step one. Own-credit CVA is determined using Citi-specific CDS spreads for the relevant tenor. Generally, counterparty CVA is determined using CDS spread indices for each credit rating and tenor. For certain identified facilities where individual analysis is practicable (for example, exposures to monoline counterparties) counterparty-specific CDS spreads are used. The CVA adjustment is designed to incorporate a market view of the credit risk inherent in the derivative portfolio as required by SFAS 157. However, most derivative instruments are negotiated bilateral contracts and are not commonly transferred to third parties. Derivative instruments are normally settled contractually, or if terminated early, are terminated at a value negotiated bilaterally between the counterparties. Therefore, the CVA (both counterparty and own-credit) may not be realized upon a settlement or termination in the normal course of business. In addition, all or a portion of the credit valuation adjustments may be reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods in the event of changes in the credit risk of Citi or its counterparties, or changes in the credit mitigants (collateral and netting agreements) associated with the derivative instruments. Historically, Citigroups credit spreads have moved in tandem with general counterparty credit spreads, thus providing offsetting CVAs affecting revenue. However, in the fourth quarter of 2008, Citigroups credit spreads generally narrowed and counterparty credit spreads widened, each of which negatively affected revenues. The table below summarizes the CVA applied to the fair value of derivative instruments as of December 31, 2008 and 2007.

See Note 26 on page 191 for further information.  The effect of counterparty credit risk embedded in non-derivative instruments. During 2008, general spread widening has negatively affected the market value of a range of financial instruments. Losses on non-derivative instruments, such as bonds and loans, related to counterparty credit risk are not included in the table above. Credit Derivatives Like all other derivative types, the Company makes markets in and trades a range of credit derivatives, both on behalf of clients as well as for its own account. Through these contracts the Company either purchases or writes protection on either a single-name or portfolio basis. The Company uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its corporate loan portfolio and other cash positions, to take proprietary trading positions, and to facilitate client transactions. Credit derivatives generally require that the seller of credit protection make payments to the buyer upon the occurrence of predefined events (settlement triggers). These settlement triggers, which are defined by the form of the derivative and the referenced credit, are generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference credit and, in a more limited range of transactions, debt restructuring. Credit derivative transactions referring to emerging market reference credits will also typically include additional settlement triggers to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment moratorium. In certain transactions on a portfolio of referenced credits or asset-backed securities, the seller of protection may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of losses have occurred with respect to the portfolio and/or may only be required to pay for losses up to a specified amount. 92 Table of Contents The following tables summarize the key characteristics of the Companys credit derivative portfolio by activity, counterparty and derivative form as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007: 2008: Fair values Notionals In millions of dollars Receivable Payable Beneficiary Guarantor By Activity: Credit portfolio $ 3,257 $ 15 $ 71,131 $  Dealer/client 225,094 203,694 1,519,081 1,443,280 Total by Activity $ 228,351 $ 203,709 $ 1,590,212 $ 1,443,280 By Industry/Counterparty: Bank $ 128,042 $ 121,811 $ 996,248 $ 943,949 Broker-dealer 59,321 56,858 403,501 365,664 Monoline 6,886 91 9,973 139 Non-financial 4,874 2,561 5,608 7,540 Insurance and other financial institutions 29,228 22,388 174,882 125,988 Total by Industry/Counterparty $ 228,351 $ 203,709 $ 1,590,212 $ 1,443,280 By Instrument: Credit default swaps and options $ 221,159 $ 203,220 $ 1,560,223 $ 1,441,375 Total return swaps and other 7,192 489 29,989 1,905 Total by Instrument $ 228,351 $ 203,709 $ 1,590,212 $ 1,443,280 2007: Fair values Notionals In millions of dollars Receivable Payable Beneficiary Guarantor By Activity: Credit portfolio $ 626 $ 129 $ 91,228 $  Dealer/client 82,767 84,165 1,815,728 1,767,837 Total by Activity $ 83,393 $ 84,294 $ 1,906,956 $ 1,767,837 By Industry/Counterparty: Bank $ 28,571 $ 34,425 $ 1,035,217 $ 970,831 Broker-dealer 28,183 31,519 633,745 585,549 Monoline 5,044 88 15,064 1,243 Non-financial 220 331 3,682 4,253 Insurance and other financial institutions 21,375 17,931 219,248 205,961 Total by Industry/Counterparty $ 83,393 $ 84,294 $ 1,906,956 $ 1,767,837 By Instrument: Credit default swaps and options $ 82,752 $ 83,015 $ 1,891,061 $ 1,755,716 Total return swaps and other 641 1,279 15,895 12,121 Total by Instrument $ 83,393 $ 84,294 $ 1,906,956 $ 1,767,837 The fair values shown are prior to the application of any netting agreements, cash collateral, and market or credit value adjustments. The Company actively participates in trading a variety of credit derivatives products as both an active two-way market-maker for clients and to manage credit risk. During 2008, Citigroup decreased its trading volumes. The volatility and liquidity challenges in the credit markets during 2008 drove derivatives trading values higher, especially for the credit derivatives. The majority of this activity was transacted with other financial intermediaries, including both banks and broker-dealers. The total notional amount of protection purchased and sold as of December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007 decreased $317 billion and $325 billion, respectively, and to various market participants. However, the total fair value as of December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007 increased by $145 billion for protection purchased and $119 billion for protection sold. These fair value increases were due to general credit spreads widening in the credit derivative market. The Company generally has a mismatch between the total notional amounts of protection purchased and sold and it may hold the reference assets directly, rather than entering into offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired. The open risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are largely matched after certain cash positions in reference assets are considered and after notional amounts are adjusted, either to a duration-based equivalent basis or to reflect the level of subordination in tranched structures. The Company actively monitors its counterparty credit risk in credit derivative contracts. Approximately 88% of the gross receivables as of December 31, 2008 are from counterparties with which the Company maintains collateral agreements. A majority of the Companys top 15 counterparties (by receivable balance owed to the Company) are banks, financial institutions or other dealers. Contracts with these counterparties do not include ratings-based termination events. However, counterparty rating downgrades may have an incremental effect by lowering the threshold at which the Company may call for additional collateral. A number of the remaining significant counterparties are monolines. 93 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Capital is generally generated via earnings from operating businesses. This is augmented through issuance of common stock, convertible preferred stock, preferred stock, subordinated debt, and equity issued through awards under employee benefit plans. Capital is used primarily to support assets in the Companys businesses and to absorb unexpected market, credit or operational losses. The Companys uses of capital, particularly to pay dividends and repurchase common stock, became severely restricted during the latter half of 2008. See The Company, Managements Discussion and Analysis  Events in 2008, TARP and Other Regulatory Programs, Risk Factors and Common Equity on pages 2, 9, 44,47 and 95, respectively. Citigroups capital management framework is designed to ensure that Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with the Companys risk profile, all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines, and external rating agency considerations. The capital management process is centrally overseen by senior management and is reviewed at the consolidated, legal entity, and country level. Senior management oversees the capital management process of Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries mainly through Citigroups Finance and Asset and Liability Committee (FinALCO). The Committee is composed of the senior-most management of Citigroup for the purpose of engaging management in decision-making and related discussions on capital and liquidity items. Among other things, the Committees responsibilities include: determining the financial structure of Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries; ensuring that Citigroup and its regulated entities are adequately capitalized; determining appropriate asset levels and return hurdles for Citigroup and individual businesses; reviewing the funding and capital markets plan for Citigroup; and monitoring interest-rate risk, corporate and bank liquidity, the impact of currency translation on non-U.S. earnings and capital. The FinALCO has established capital targets for Citigroup and for significant subsidiaries. At December 31, 2008, these targets exceeded the regulatory standards. Common and Preferred Stock Issuances As discussed under Events in 2008 on page 9, during 2008, the Company issued $45 billion in preferred stock and warrants under TARP, $12.5 billion of convertible preferred stock in a private offering, $11.7 billion of non-convertible preferred stock in public offerings, $3.2 billion of convertible preferred stock in public offerings, and $4.9 billion of common stock in public offerings. On January 23, 2009, pursuant to our prior agreement with the purchasers of the $12.5 billion convertible preferred stock issued in the private offering, the conversion price was reset from $31.62 per share to $26.35 per share. The reset will result in Citigroups issuing approximately 79 million additional common shares if converted. There will be no impact to net income, total stockholders equity or capital ratios due to the reset. However, the reset will result in a reclassification from Retained earnings to Additional paid-in capital of $1.2 billion to reflect the benefit of the reset to the preferred stockholders. Capital Ratios Citigroup is subject to risk-based capital ratio guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Capital adequacy is measured via two risk-based ratios, Tier 1 and Total Capital (Tier 1 + Tier 2 Capital). Tier 1 Capital is considered core capital while Total Capital also includes other items such as subordinated debt and loan loss reserves. Both measures of capital are stated as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Risk-weighted assets are measured primarily on their perceived credit risk and include certain off-balance-sheet exposures, such as unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, and the notional amounts of derivative and foreign-exchange contracts. Citigroup is also subject to the Leverage Ratio requirement, a non-risk-based asset ratio, which is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of adjusted average assets. To be well capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of at least 6%, a Total Capital Ratio of at least 10%, and a Leverage Ratio of at least 3%, and not be subject to an FRB directive to maintain higher capital levels. As noted in the following table, Citigroup maintained a well capitalized position during both 2008 and 2007. Citigroup Regulatory Capital Ratios At year end 2008 2007 Tier 1 Capital 11.92 % 7.12 % Total Capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2) 15.70 10.70 Leverage (1) 6.08 4.03 (1) Tier 1 Capital divided by adjusted average assets. Events occurring during 2008, including the transactions with the U.S. government, affected Citigroups capital ratios, and any additional U.S. government financial involvement with the Company could further impact the Companys capital ratios. In addition, future operations will affect capital levels, and changes that the FASB has proposed regarding off-balance-sheet assets, consolidation and sale treatment could also have an impact on capital ratios. See also Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 174, including Funding Liquidity Facilities and Subordinate Interests. 94 Table of Contents Components of Capital Under Regulatory Guidelines In millions of dollars at year end 2008 2007 (1) Tier 1 Capital Common stockholders equity (2) $ 70,966 $ 113,447 Qualifying perpetual preferred stock 70,664  Qualifying mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts 23,899 23,594 Minority interest 1,268 4,077 Less: Net unrealized gains (losses) on securities available-for-sale, net of tax (3) (9,647 ) 471 Less: Accumulated net losses on cash flow hedges, net of tax (5,189 ) (3,163 ) Less: Pension liability adjustment, net of tax (4) (2,615 ) (1,196 ) Less: Cumulative effect included in fair value of financial liabilities attributable to credit worthiness, net of tax (5) 3,391 1,352 Less: Restricted core capital elements (6)  1,364 Less: Disallowed deferred tax assets (7) 23,520  Less: Intangible assets: Goodwill 27,132 41,053 Other disallowed intangible assets 10,607 10,511 Other (840 ) (1,500 ) Total Tier 1 Capital $ 118,758 $ 89,226 Tier 2 Capital Allowance for credit losses (8) $ 12,806 $ 15,778 Qualifying debt (9) 24,791 26,690 Unrealized marketable equity securities gains (3) 43 1,063 Restricted core capital elements (6)  1,364 Total Tier 2 Capital $ 37,640 $ 44,895 Total Capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2) $ 156,398 $ 134,121 Risk-weighted assets (10) $ 996,247 $ 1,253,321 (1) Reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. (2) Reflects prior period adjustment to opening retained earnings as presented in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on page 117. (3) Tier 1 Capital excludes unrealized gains and losses on debt securities available-for-sale in accordance with regulatory risk-based capital guidelines. Institutions are required to deduct from Tier 1 Capital net unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values, net of tax. The federal bank regulatory agencies permit institutions to include in Tier 2 Capital up to 45% of pretax net unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values, net of tax. (4) The FRB granted interim capital relief for the impact of adopting SFAS 158. (5) The impact of including Citigroups own credit rating in valuing liabilities for which the fair value option has been selected is excluded from Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with regulatory risk-based capital guidelines. (6) Represents the excess of allowable restricted core capital in Tier 1 Capital. Restricted core capital is limited to 25% of all core capital elements, net of goodwill. (7) Of the Companys $44 billion of net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2008, $14 billion were includable without limitation in regulatory capital pursuant to the risk-based capital guidelines, while $24 billion exceeds the limitation imposed by these guidelines and as disallowed deferred tax assets were deducted in arriving at Tier 1 Capital. The Companys other $6 billion of net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2008, primarily represented the deferred tax effects of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, which are permitted to be excluded prior to deriving the amount of net deferred tax assets subject to limitation under the guidelines. The Company had no disallowed deferred tax assets at December 31, 2007. (8) Can include up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Any excess allowance is deducted from risk-weighted assets. (9) Includes qualifying subordinated debt in an amount not exceeding 50% of Tier 1 Capital. (10) Includes risk-weighted credit equivalent amounts, net of applicable bilateral netting agreements, of $102.9 billion for interest rate, commodity and equity derivative contracts, foreign-exchange contracts and credit derivatives as of December 31, 2008, compared with $91.3 billion as of December 31, 2007. Market-risk-equivalent assets included in risk-weighted assets amounted to $101.8 billion at December 31, 2008 and $109.0 billion at December 31, 2007. Risk-weighted assets also include the effect of other off-balance-sheet exposures, such as unused loan commitments and letters of credit, and reflect deductions for certain intangible assets and any excess allowance for credit losses. Common stockholders equity decreased approximately $42.4 billion to $71.0 billion, representing 3.7% of total assets as of December 31, 2008 from $113.4 billion and 5.2% at December 31, 2007. Common Equity The table below summarizes the change in common stockholders equity during 2008: In billions of dollars Common equity, December 31, 2007 $ 113.4 Net loss (27.7 ) Employee benefit plans and other activities 4.1 Dividends (7.6 ) Issuance of shares for Nikko Cordial acquisition 4.4 Issuance of common stock 4.9 Net change in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax (20.5 ) Common equity, December 31, 2008 $ 71.0 As of December 31, 2008, $6.7 billion of stock repurchases remained under authorized repurchase programs after no material repurchases were made in 2008 and $0.7 billion of repurchases were made in 2007. Under TARP, the Company is restricted from repurchasing common stock, subject to certain exceptions, including in the ordinary course of business as part of employee benefit programs. In addition, in accordance with various TARP programs, Citigroup has agreed not to pay a quarterly common stock dividend exceeding $0.01 per share per quarter for three years (beginning in 2009) without the consent of the U.S. Treasury. See TARP and Other Regulatory Programs on page 44. The Company is currently in ongoing discussions with the Federal Reserve Board regarding an increase to the Companys risk-weighted assets resulting from certain liquidity-facility transactions relating to the Companys primary credit card securitization trusts. This increase in risk-weighted assets will affect the calculation of the Companys risk-based capital ratios. However, the timing and extent of the increase is not yet certain, pending completion of discussions with the Federal Reserve Board. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 174. Tangible Common Equity (TCE) The Company and its bank regulators view the Tier 1 Capital Ratio as being the most important measure of risk capital for bank holding companies. Citigroups Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 11.92% at December 31, 2008 compared to 7.12% at December 31, 2007. Tangible common equity (TCE) represents Common equity less Goodwill and Intangible assets (excluding MSRs). TCE was $29.7 billion at December 31, 2008, compared to $58.1 billion at December 31, 2007. The TCE Ratio (TCE divided by risk-weighted assets) was 3.0% at December 31, 2008 compared to 4.6% at December 31, 2007. The primary drivers of the decline in TCE during the year were the 2008 net loss of $27.7 billion, and an increase in negative Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) of $21 billion. On February 27, 2009, the Company announced an exchange offer of its common stock for up to $27.5 billion of its existing preferred securities and trust preferred securities. The U.S. government will match this exchange up to a maximum of $25 billion of its preferred. These transactions are intended to increase the Companys TCE. See Outlook for 2009 on page 7. 95 Table of Contents Mandatorily Redeemable Securities of Subsidiary Trusts Total mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts (trust preferred securities), which qualify as Tier 1 Capital, were $23.899 billion at December 31, 2008, as compared to $23.594 billion at December 31, 2007. In 2008, Citigroup did not issue any new enhanced trust preferred securities. The FRB issued a final rule, with an effective date of April 11, 2005, which retains trust preferred securities in Tier 1 Capital of bank holding companies, but with stricter quantitative limits and clearer qualitative standards. Under the rule, after a five-year transition period, the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities and certain other restricted core capital elements included in Tier 1 Capital of internationally active banking organizations, such as Citigroup, would be limited to 15% of total core capital elements, net of goodwill, less any associated deferred tax liability. The amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit could be included in Tier 2 Capital, subject to restrictions. At December 31, 2008, Citigroup had approximately 11.8% against the limit. The Company expects to be within restricted core capital limits prior to the implementation date of March 31, 2009. The FRB permits additional securities, such as the equity units sold to ADIA, to be included in Tier 1 Capital up to 25% (including the restricted core capital elements in the 15% limit) of total core capital elements, net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability. At December 31, 2008, Citigroup had approximately 16.1% against the limit. The FRB granted interim capital relief for the impact of adopting SFAS 158 at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. The FRB and the FFIEC may propose amendments to, and issue interpretations of, risk-based capital guidelines and reporting instructions. These may affect reported capital ratios and net risk-weighted assets. Capital Resources of Citigroups Depository Institutions Citigroups subsidiary depository institutions in the United States are subject to risk-based capital guidelines issued by their respective primary federal bank regulatory agencies, which are similar to the FRBs guidelines. To be well capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, Citigroups depository institutions must have a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of at least 6%, a Total Capital (Tier 1 + Tier 2 Capital) Ratio of at least 10% and a Leverage Ratio of at least 5%, and not be subject to a regulatory directive to meet and maintain higher capital levels. At December 31, 2008, all of Citigroups subsidiary depository institutions were well capitalized under the federal regulatory agencies definitions, including Citigroups primary depository institution, Citibank, N.A., as noted in the following table: Citibank, N.A. Components of Capital and Ratios Under Regulatory Guidelines In billions of dollars at year end 2008 2007 Tier 1 Capital $ 71.0 $ 82.0 Total Capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2) 108.4 121.6 Tier 1 Capital Ratio 9.94 % 8.98 % Total Capital Ratio (Tier 1 and Tier 2) 15.18 13.33 Leverage Ratio (1) 5.82 6.65 (1) Tier 1 Capital divided by adjusted average assets. Citibank, N.A. had a net loss for 2008 amounting to $6.2 billion. During 2008, Citibank, N.A. received contributions from its parent company of $6.1 billion. Citibank, N.A. did not issue any additional subordinated notes in 2008. Total subordinated notes issued to Citicorp Holdings Inc. that were outstanding at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 and included in Citibank, N.A.s Tier 2 Capital, amounted to $28.2 billion. Citibank, N.A. received an additional $14.3 billion in capital contribution from its parent company in January 2009. The impact of this contribution is not reflected in the table above. The substantial events in 2008 impacting the capital of Citigroup, and the potential future events discussed on page 94 under Citigroup Regulatory Capital Ratios, also affected, or could affect, Citibank, N.A. 96 Table of Contents The following table presents the estimated sensitivity of Citigroups and Citibank, N.A.s Capital Ratios to changes of $100 million of Tier 1 or Total Capital (numerator), or changes of $1 billion in risk-weighted assets or adjusted average assets (denominator) based on financial information as of December 31, 2008. This information is provided solely for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in the Companys financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of Capital, risk-weighted assets or adjusted average assets. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one factor may have a larger basis-point impact than is reflected in this table.

(CGMI), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI)are subject to various securities and commodities regulations and capital adequacy requirements of the regulatory and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate. Specifically, the Companys U.S.-registered broker-dealer subsidiaries, including CGMI, are subject to the Securities and Exchange Commissions Net Capital Rule, Rule 15c3-1 (the Net Capital Rule) under the Exchange Act and related NYSE regulations. Under the Net Capital Rule, CGMI is required to maintain minimum net capital equal to 2% of aggregate debit items, as defined. Under NYSE regulations, CGMI may be required to reduce its business if its net capital is less than 4% of aggregate debit items and may also be prohibited from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital would be less than 5% of aggregate debit items. Furthermore, the Net Capital Rule does not permit withdrawal of equity or subordinated capital if the resulting net capital would be less than 5% of aggregate debit items. CGMI computes net capital in accordance with the provisions of Appendix E of the Net Capital Rule. This methodology allows CGMI to compute market risk capital charges using internal value-at-risk models. Under Appendix E, CGMI is also required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $1 billion and net capital in excess of $500 million. CGMI is also required to notify the SEC in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. As of December 31, 2008, CGMI had tentative net capital in excess of both the minimum and the notification requirements. Compliance with the Net Capital Rule could limit those operations of CGMI that require the intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and trading activities and the financing of customer account balances, and also restrict CGMHIs ability to withdraw capital from its broker-dealer subsidiaries, which in turn could limit CGMHIs ability to pay dividends and make payments on its debt. At December 31, 2008, CGMI had net capital, computed in accordance with the Net Capital Rule, of $2.5 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by $1.6 billion. In addition, certain of the Companys broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the other countries in which they do business, including requirements to maintain specified levels of net capital or its equivalent. The Companys broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their capital requirements at December 31, 2008. See further discussions on Capital Requirements on page 228. Regulatory Capital Standards Developments Citigroup supports the move to a new set of risk-based regulatory capital standards, published on June 26, 2004 (and subsequently amended in November 2005) by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, consisting of central banks and bank supervisors from 13 countries. The international version of the Basel II framework will allow Citigroup to leverage internal risk models used to measure credit, operational, and market risk exposures to drive regulatory capital calculations. On December 7, 2007, the U.S. banking regulators published the rules for large banks to comply with Basel II in the U.S. These rules require Citigroup, as a large and internationally active bank, to comply with the most advanced Basel II approaches for calculating credit and operational risk capital requirements. The U.S. implementation timetable consists of a parallel calculation period under the current regulatory capital regime (Basel I) and Basel II, starting anytime between April 1, 2008, and April 1, 2010 followed by a three-year transition period, typically starting 12 months after the beginning of parallel reporting. The U.S. regulators have reserved the right to change how Basel II is applied in the U.S. following a review at the end of the second year of the transitional period, and to retain the existing prompt corrective action and leverage capital requirements applicable to banking organizations in the U.S. The Company intends to implement Basel II within the timeframe required by the final rules. 97 Table of Contents FUNDING Overview Because Citigroup is a bank holding company, substantially all of its net earnings are generated within its operating subsidiaries. These subsidiaries make funds available to Citigroup, primarily in the form of dividends. Certain subsidiaries dividend-paying abilities may be limited by covenant restrictions in credit agreements, regulatory requirements and/or rating-agency requirements that also impact their capitalization levels. Global financial markets faced unprecedented disruption in the latter part of 2008. Citigroup and other U.S. financial services firms are currently benefiting from numerous government programs that are improving markets and supporting their current liquidity positions. These programs provide Citigroup with significant current funding capacity and significant liquidity support. These include:  In October 2008, the FDIC established the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). The TLGP provides a guarantee of certain newly issued senior unsecured long-term debt of banks, thrifts and certain holding companies, and by providing full coverage of non-interest-bearing deposit transaction accounts, regardless of dollar amount. The TLGP guarantees coverage of qualifying senior unsecured debt issued with a maturity prior to July 1, 2012. A significant portion of Citigroups existing commercial paper is guaranteed under this program. In addition, in December 2008, Citigroup issued approximately $5.75 billion of senior unsecured debt under this program. In January and February 2009, Citigroup and its affiliates issued an additional $14.9 billion in senior unsecured debt under the program. It has been proposed that the TLGP be extended from its current expiration date of June 30, 2009 to October 30, 2009.  In March 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to establish the Primary Dealer Credit Facility to provide overnight financing to primary dealers in exchange for a broad range of collateral. Citigroup utilizes this program to supplement its secured financing capabilities. On December 31, 2008, Citigroup had funded $13.8 billion on a secured basis under this program.  In October 2008, the Federal Reserve Board established the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) to provide a liquidity backstop to U.S. issuers of commercial paper. Under the CPFF, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York finances purchases of unsecured highly rated three-month U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper of eligible issuers through primary dealers. On December 31, 2008, Citigroup had $9.0 billion Commercial Paper and $3.3 billion Credit Card Asset-Backed Commercial Paper outstanding under the program.  In March 2008, the Federal Reserve Board expanded its securities lending program to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury securities and other collateral and thus foster the functioning of financial markets more generally. Under the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), the Federal Reserve lends up to $200 billion of Treasury securities to primary dealers secured for a term of 28 days by a pledge of other securities, including federal agency debt, federal agency residential-mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and non-agency AAA/Aaa-rated private-label residential MBS. The securities are made available through a weekly auction process. Citigroup uses the TSLF to facilitate secured funding transactions for its inventory as well as that of its customers. It has been proposed that the CPFF, PDCF and the TSLF be extended from their current expiration dates of June 30, 2009 to October 30, 2009.  In November 2008, the Federal Reserve Board announced the creation of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), a facility designed to support the issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS) collateralized by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). An expansion of this program, announced in February 2009, could broaden the eligible collateral to encompass other types of newly issued AAA-rated asset-backed securities, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities, private-label residential mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities. Details of this program, including its commencement date, have not yet been announced. The TALF is currently scheduled to expire on December 31, 2009.  The U.S. Department of Education (DOE) has been working to ensure uninterrupted and timely access to Federal student loans by taking steps to maintain stability in student lending. The Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 (ECASLA) enacted by Congress in May 2008 allows the DOE to purchase qualifying Stafford and PLUS Loans originated during the 2003-2009 academic years. Legislation passed in October 2008 provides for a one year extension of authority for the DOE to purchase certain guaranteed student loans as defined under ECASLA through the 2009-2010 academic year. On July 3, 2008, the Company filed a required Notice of Intent to Participate with the Department under a program limited to qualifying loans originated during the 2008-2009 academic year. The Company received its initial funding through the Participation Program on December 5, 2008. In addition, on November 8, 2008, the DOE announced that it would provide liquidity support to one or more conforming Asset-Based Commercial Paper (ABCP) conduit(s). While details of this conduit are forthcoming, it is intended that all fully-disbursed non-consolidation Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans awarded between October 1, 2003 and July 1, 2009 will be eligible for inclusion. On November 20, 2008 the DOE announced that it will take the additional step of using existing authority to purchase certain 2007-2008 academic year FFELP loans. In addition to the above programs, during the second half of 2007 and the full year of 2008, the Company took a series of actions to reduce potential funding risks related to short-term market dislocations. The amount of commercial paper outstanding was reduced and the weighted-average maturity was extended, the parent company liquidity portfolio (a portfolio of cash and highly liquid securities) and broker-dealer cash box (unencumbered cash deposits) were increased substantially and the amount of unsecured overnight bank borrowings was reduced. For each of the past eight months in the period ending December 31, 2008, the Company was, on average, a net lender of funds in the interbank market or had excess cash placed in its account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. As of December 31, 2008, the parent company liquidity portfolio and broker-dealer cash box totaled $66.8 billion as compared with $24.2 billion at December 31, 2007. These actions to reduce funding risks, the reduction of the balance sheet and the substantial support provided by U.S. government programs have allowed the combined parent and broker-dealer entities to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all maturing unsecured debt obligations due within a one-year time horizon, without accessing the unsecured markets. 98 Table of Contents Sources of Liquidity Primary sources of liquidity for Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries include:  deposits;  collateralized financing transactions;  senior and subordinated debt;  commercial paper;  trust preferred and preferred securities; and  purchased/wholesale funds. Citigroups funding sources are diversified across funding types and geography, a benefit of its global franchise. Funding for Citigroup and its major operating subsidiaries includes a geographically diverse retail and corporate deposit base of $774.2 billion. These deposits are diversified across products and regions, with approximately two-thirds of them outside of the U.S. This diversification provides the Company with an important, stable and low-cost source of funding. A significant portion of these deposits has been, and is expected to be, long-term and stable, and are considered to be core. There are qualitative as well as quantitative assessments that determine the Companys calculation of core deposits. The first step in this process is a qualitative assessment of the deposits. For example, as a result of the Companys qualitative analysis certain deposits with wholesale funding characteristics are excluded from consideration as core. Deposits that qualify under the Companys qualitative assessments are then subjected to quantitative analysis. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and the sale of our retail banking operations in Germany during the year ending December 31, 2008, the Companys deposit base remained stable. On a volume basis, deposit increases were noted in Transaction Services, U.S. Retail Banking and Smith Barney. This was partially offset by the Companys decision to reduce deposits considered wholesale funding, consistent with the Companys de-leveraging efforts, and declines in International Consumer Banking and the Private Bank. Citigroup and its subsidiaries have historically had a significant presence in the global capital markets. The Companys capital markets funding activities have been primarily undertaken by two legal entities: (i) Citigroup Inc., which issues long-term debt, medium-term notes, trust preferred securities, and preferred and common stock; and (ii) Citigroup Funding Inc. (CFI), a first-tier subsidiary of Citigroup, which issues commercial paper, medium-term notes and structured equity-linked and credit-linked notes, all of which are guaranteed by Citigroup. Other significant elements of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet include collateralized advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank system, long-term debt related to the consolidation of ICGs Structured Investment Vehicles, asset-backed outstandings, and certain borrowings of foreign subsidiaries. Each of Citigroups major operating subsidiaries finances its operations on a basis consistent with its capitalization, regulatory structure and the environment in which it operates. Particular attention is paid to those businesses that for tax, sovereign risk, or regulatory reasons cannot be freely and readily funded in the international markets. Citigroups borrowings have historically been diversified by geography, investor, instrument and currency. Decisions regarding the ultimate currency and interest rate profile of liquidity generated through these borrowings can be separated from the actual issuance through the use of derivative instruments. Citigroup is a provider of liquidity facilities to the commercial paper programs of the two primary Credit Card securitization trusts with which it transacts. Citigroup may also provide other types of support to the trusts. As a result of the recent economic downturn, its impact on the cashflows of the trusts, and in response to credit rating agency reviews of the trusts, the Company increased the credit enhancement in the Omni Trust, and plans to provide additional enhancement to the Master Trust (see Note 23 to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 179 for a further discussion). This support preserves investor sponsorship of our card securitization franchise, an important source of liquidity. Banking Subsidiaries There are various legal limitations on the ability of Citigroups subsidiary depository institutions to extend credit, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to Citigroup and its non-bank subsidiaries. The approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in the case of national banks, or the Office of Thrift Supervision, in the case of federal savings banks, is required if total dividends declared in any calendar year exceed amounts specified by the applicable agencys regulations. State-chartered depository institutions are subject to dividend limitations imposed by applicable state law. In determining the declaration of dividends, each depository institution must also consider its effect on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies that indicate that banking organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Non-Banking Subsidiaries Citigroup also receives dividends from its non-bank subsidiaries. These non-bank subsidiaries are generally not subject to regulatory restrictions on dividends. However, as discussed in Capital Resources and Liquidity on page 94, the ability of CGMHI to declare dividends can be restricted by capital considerations of its broker-dealer subsidiaries. CGMHIs consolidated balance sheet is liquid, with the vast majority of its assets consisting of marketable securities and collateralized short-term financing agreements arising from securities transactions. CGMHI monitors and evaluates the adequacy of its capital and borrowing base on a daily basis to maintain liquidity and to ensure that its capital base supports the regulatory capital requirements of its subsidiaries. Some of Citigroups non-bank subsidiaries, including CGMHI, have credit facilities with Citigroups subsidiary depository institutions, including Citibank, N.A. Borrowings under these facilities must be secured in accordance with Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. There are various legal restrictions on the extent to which a bank holding company and certain of its non-bank subsidiaries can borrow or obtain credit from Citigroups subsidiary depository institutions or engage in certain other transactions with them. In general, these restrictions require that transactions be on arms length terms and be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 168. At December 31, 2008, long-term debt and commercial paper outstanding for Citigroup, CGMHI, CFI and Citigroups subsidiaries were as follows: In billions of dollars Citigroup parent company CGMHI (2) Citigroup FundingInc. (2) Other Citigroup subsidiaries Long-term debt $ 192.3 $ 20.6 $ 37.4 $ 109.3 (1) Commercial paper $  $  $ 28.6 $ 0.5 (1) At December 31, 2008, approximately $67.4 billion relates to collateralized advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. (2) Citigroup Inc. guarantees all of CFIs debt and CGMHIs publicly issued securities. 99 Table of Contents See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 168 for further detail on long-term debt and commercial paper outstanding. Credit Ratings Citigroups ability to access the capital markets and other sources of wholesale funds, as well as the cost of these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits, is highly dependent on its credit ratings. The table below indicates the current ratings for Citigroup. On November 24, 2008, Fitch Ratings lowered Citigroup Inc.s and Citibank, N.A.s senior debt rating to A+ from AA-. In doing so, Fitch removed the rating from Watch Negative and applied a Stable Outlook. On December 18, 2008, Moodys Investors Service lowered Citigroup Inc.s senior debt rating to A2 from Aa3 and Citibank, N.A.s long-term rating to Aa3 from Aa1. In doing so, Moodys removed the rating from Under Review for possible downgrade and applied a Stable Outlook. On January 16, 2009, Moodys placed the ratings outlook of Citigroup Inc. and its subsidiaries on Under Review for possible downgrade from Stable Outlook, while maintaining the Stable Outlook for Citibank N.A.s short-term obligations. On February 27, 2009, Moodys Investors Service lowered Citigroup Inc.s senior debt ratings to A3 from A2 and Citibank, N.A.s long term rating to A1 from Aa3. In doing so, Moodys removed the ratings from Under Review for possible downgrade and applied a Stable Outlook. On December 19, 2008, Standard & Poors lowered Citigroup Inc.s senior debt rating to A from AA- and Citibank, N.A.s long-term rating to A+ from AA. In doing so, Standard & Poors removed the rating from CreditWatch Negative and applied a Stable Outlook. On December 19, 2008, Standard & Poors also lowered the short-term and commercial paper ratings of Citigroup and Citibank, N.A. to A-1 from A-1+. On February 27, 2009, Standard & Poors placed the ratings of Citigroup Inc. and its subsidiaries on Negative Outlook. As a result of the Citigroup guarantee, changes in ratings and ratings outlooks for Citigroup Funding Inc. are the same as those of Citigroup noted above. 100 Table of Contents Citigroups Debt Ratings as of December 31, 2008 Citigroup Inc. Citigroup Funding Inc. Citibank, N.A. Senior debt Commercial paper Senior debt Commercial paper Long- term Short- term Fitch Ratings A+ F1+ A+ F1+ A+ F1+ Moodys Investors Service A2 P-1 A2 P-1 Aa3 P-1 Standard & Poors A A-1 A A-1 A+ A-1 Ratings downgrades by Fitch Ratings, Moodys Investors Service or Standard & Poors have had and could have impacts on funding and liquidity, and could also have further explicit impact on liquidity due to collateral triggers and other cash requirements. Because of the current credit ratings of Citigroup Inc., a one-notch downgrade of its senior debt/long-term rating would likely impact Citigroup Inc.s commercial paper/short-term rating. As of January 31, 2009, a one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup Inc. accompanied by a one-notch downgrade of Citigroup Inc.s commercial paper/short-term rating would result in an approximately $11.0 billion funding requirement in the form of collateral and cash obligations. Further, as of January 31, 2009, a one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term ratings of Citibank, N.A. would result in an approximately $7.0 billion funding requirement in the form of collateral and cash obligations. Because of the credit ratings of Citibank, N.A., a one-notch downgrade of its senior debt/long-term rating is unlikely to have any impact on its commercial paper/short-term rating. 101 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY Overview Citigroups liquidity management is structured to ensure the availability of funds and to optimize the free flow of funds through the Companys legal and regulatory structure. Principal constraints relate to legal and regulatory limitations, sovereign risk and tax considerations. Consistent with these constraints and the consolidated funding activities described in the Funding section on page 98, Citigroups primary objectives for liquidity management are established by entity and in aggregate across three main operating entities as follows:  Holding Company (Parent);  Broker-Dealer (CGMHI); and  Bank Entities. Management of Liquidity Management of liquidity at Citigroup is the responsibility of the Treasurer. A uniform liquidity risk management policy exists for Citigroup and its major operating subsidiaries. Under this policy, there is a single set of standards for the measurement of liquidity risk in order to ensure consistency across businesses, stability in methodologies and transparency of risk. Management of liquidity at each operating subsidiary and/or country is performed on a daily basis and is monitored by Corporate Treasury and independent risk management. The basis of Citigroups liquidity management is strong decentralized liquidity management at each of its principal operating subsidiaries and in each of its countries, combined with an active corporate oversight function. As discussed in Capital Resources on page 94, Citigroups FinALCO undertakes this oversight responsibility along with the Treasurer. One of the objectives of the FinALCO is to monitor and review the overall liquidity and balance sheet positions of Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries. Similarly, Asset and Liability Committees are also established for each country and/or major line of business. Monitoring Liquidity Each principal operating subsidiary and/or country must prepare an annual funding and liquidity plan for review by the Treasurer and approval by independent risk management. The funding and liquidity plan includes analysis of the balance sheet, as well as the economic and business conditions impacting the liquidity of the major operating subsidiary and/or country. As part of the funding and liquidity plan, liquidity limits, liquidity ratios, market triggers, and assumptions for periodic stress tests are established and approved. At a minimum, these parameters are reviewed on an annual basis. Liquidity Limits Liquidity limits establish boundaries for market access in business-as-usual conditions and are monitored against the liquidity position on a daily basis. These limits are established based on the size of the balance sheet, depth of the market, experience level of local management, stability of the liabilities and liquidity of the assets. Finally, the limits are subject to the evaluation of the entities stress test results. Generally, limits are established such that in stress scenarios, entities are self-funded or net providers of liquidity. Thus, the risk tolerance of the liquidity position is limited based on the capacity to cover the position in a stressed environment. These limits are the key daily risk-management tool for the Parent and Bank Entities. Within this construct, there is a funding framework for the Companys activities. The primary benchmark for the Parent and Broker-Dealer is that, on a combined basis, Citigroup maintains sufficient liquidity to meet all maturing unsecured debt obligations due within one year without accessing the unsecured markets. The resulting short-term ratio is monitored on a daily basis. The short-term ratio consists of the following significant components: Liquidity Sources  Cash and Liquid Securities Portfolio The Company maintains cash and a portfolio of highly liquid/highly-rated securities that could be sold or financed on a secured basis. The cash balances are available for same-day settlement.  Unencumbered Securities of the Broker-Dealer CGMHI has unencumbered securities that are available for sale or can be financed on a secured basis. The liquidity assumptions are reviewed periodically to assess liquidation horizons and required margins in line with market conditions.  23A Capacity As discussed further in the Funding section beginning on page 98, some of Citigroups non-bank subsidiaries, including CGMHI, have credit facilities with Citigroups subsidiary depository institutions, including Citibank, N.A. Borrowings under these facilities must be secured in accordance with Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. Liquidity Obligations  Commercial Paper Maturing commercial paper issued by CFI. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 168 for further information.  LT Debt Maturing Within 12 Months This includes debt maturing within the next 12 months of Citigroup, CFI and CGMHI.  Guaranteed Money Market Notes Represents a portion of notes issued through Citis Private Bank via a non-bank subsidiary that is an element of Parent Company funding.  Maturing Bank Loans As further described in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 168, CGMHI has a series of committed and uncommitted third-party bank facilities that it uses in the ordinary course of business.  Interest and Preferred Dividends Represents interest on the Companys debt and dividends on its preferred stock.  Other At December 31, 2008, this category included miscellaneous payables and potential payments under letters of credit, legal settlements and structured notes. In addition, a series of funding and risk-management benchmarks and monitoring tools are established for the parent, broker-dealer and bank entities, as further described in the following sections below. 102 Table of Contents Liquidity Ratios A series of standard corporate-wide liquidity ratios has been established to monitor the structural elements of Citigroups liquidity. As discussed on page 101, for the Parent and CGMHI, ratios are established for liquid assets against short-term obligations. For bank entities, key liquidity ratios include cash capital (defined as core deposits, long-term debt, and capital compared with illiquid assets), liquid assets against liquidity gaps, core deposits to loans, and deposits to loans. Several measures exist to review potential concentrations of funding by individual name, product, industry, or geography. Triggers for management discussion, which may result in other actions, have been established against these ratios. In addition, each individual major operating subsidiary or country establishes targets against these ratios and may monitor other ratios as approved in its funding and liquidity plan. For CGMHI and Bank Entities, one of the key structural liquidity measures is the cash capital ratio. Cash capital is a broader measure of the ability to fund the structurally illiquid portion of the Companys balance sheet than traditional measures such as deposits to loans or core deposits to loans. The ratio measures the ability to fund illiquid assets with structurally long-term funding over one year. At December 31, 2008, both CGMHI and the aggregate Bank Entities had an excess of structural long-term funding as compared with their illiquid assets. Market Triggers Market triggers are internal or external market or economic factors that may imply a change to market liquidity or Citigroups access to the markets. Citigroup market triggers are monitored on a weekly basis by the Treasurer and the head of Risk Architecture and are presented to the FinALCO. Appropriate market triggers are also established and monitored for each major operating subsidiary and/or country as part of the funding and liquidity plans. Local triggers are reviewed with the local country or business ALCO and independent risk management. Stress Testing Simulated liquidity stress testing is periodically performed for each major operating subsidiary and/or country. A variety of firm-specific and market-related scenarios are used at the consolidated level and in individual countries. These scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, credit ratings, contingent uses of funding, and political and economic conditions in certain countries. The results of stress tests of individual countries and operating subsidiaries are reviewed to ensure that each individual major operating subsidiary or country is either a self-funded or net provider of liquidity. In addition, a Contingency Funding Plan is prepared on a periodic basis for Citigroup. The plan includes detailed policies, procedures, roles and responsibilities, and the results of corporate stress tests. The product of these stress tests is a series of alternatives that can be used by the Treasurer in a liquidity event. During 2008, Citigroup increased the frequency, duration, and severity of certain stress testing, particularly related to the interconnection of idiosyncratic and systemic risk. In addition, in conformity with recommendations made by the Credit Risk Management Policy Group III, Citigroup instituted a 30-day maximum cash flow for some of its key operating entities. CGMHI monitors liquidity by tracking asset levels, collateral and funding availability to maintain flexibility to meet its financial commitments. As a policy, CGMHI attempts to maintain sufficient capital and funding sources in order to have the capacity to finance itself on a fully collateralized basis in the event that its access to uncollateralized financing is temporarily impaired. This is documented in CGMHIs Contingency Funding Plan. This plan is reviewed periodically to keep the funding options current and in line with market conditions. The management of this plan includes an analysis used to determine CGMHIs ability to withstand varying levels of stress, including rating downgrades, which could impact its liquidation horizons and required margins. CGMHI maintains liquidity reserves of cash and available loan value of unencumbered securities in excess of its outstanding short-term uncollateralized liabilities. This is monitored on a daily basis. CGMHI also ensures that long-term illiquid assets are funded with long-term liabilities. 103 Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Citigroup and its subsidiaries are involved with several types of off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities (SPEs), primarily in connection with securitization activities in the Consumer Banking and Institutional Clients Group. Citigroup and its subsidiaries use SPEs principally to obtain liquidity and favorable capital treatment by securitizing certain of Citigroups financial assets, assisting clients in securitizing their financial assets and creating investment products for clients. For further information about the Companys securitization activities and involvement in SPEs, see Note 23 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 174 and Significant Accounting Policies and Significant EstimatesSecuritizations on page 18. The following tables describe certain characteristics of assets owned by certain identified significant unconsolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2008. These VIEs and the Companys exposure to the VIEs are described in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 174.

Amounts include $140 billion and $259 billion with original maturity of less than one year at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. See Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 206 for additional information on credit commitments and lines of credit. 104 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table includes aggregated information about Citigroups contractual obligations that impact its short- and long-term liquidity and capital needs. The table includes information about payments due under specified contractual obligations, aggregated by type of contractual obligation. It includes the maturity profile of the Companys consolidated long-term debt, operating leases and other long-term liabilities. The Companys capital lease obligations are included in purchase obligations in the table. Citigroups contractual obligations include purchase obligations that are enforceable and legally binding for the Company. For the purposes of the table below, purchase obligations are included through the termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is renewable. Many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include clauses that would allow the Company to cancel the agreement with specified notice; however, that impact is not included in the table (unless Citigroup has already notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate the agreement). Other liabilities reflected on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet include obligations for goods and services that have already been received, litigation settlements, uncertain tax positions, as well as other long-term liabilities that have been incurred and will ultimately be paid in cash. Excluded from the following table are obligations that are generally short term in nature, including deposit liabilities and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. The table also excludes certain insurance and investment contracts subject to mortality and morbidity risks or without defined maturities, such that the timing of payments and withdrawals is uncertain. The liabilities related to these insurance and investment contracts are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as Insurance Policy and Claims Reserves, Contractholder Funds, and Separate and Variable Accounts. Citigroups funding policy for pension plans is generally to fund to the minimum amounts required by the applicable laws and regulations. At December 31, 2008, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are currently planned for the U.S. pension plans. Accordingly, no amounts have been included in the table below for future contributions to the U.S. pension plans. For the non-U.S. plans, discretionary contributions in 2009 are anticipated to be approximately $167 million and this amount has been included in purchase obligations in the table below. The estimated pension plan contributions are subject to change, since contribution decisions are affected by various factors, such as market performance, regulatory and legal requirements, and managements ability to change funding policy. For additional information regarding the Companys retirement benefit obligations, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 143.

Also included are various litigation settlements. 105 Table of Contents PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS The Company has several non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and has various defined benefit pension and termination indemnity plans covering employees outside the United States. The U.S. defined benefit plan provides benefits under a cash balance formula. Employees satisfying certain age and service requirements remain covered by a prior final pay formula. The Company also offers postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible U.S. retired employees, as well as to certain eligible employees outside the United States. The following table shows the pension (benefit) expense and contributions for Citigroups plans: U.S. plans Non-U.S. plans In millions of dollars 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Pension (benefit) expense (1)(2) $ (160 ) $ 179 $ 182 $ 205 $ 123 $ 115 Companycontributions (3)    286 223 382 (1) The 2008 expense includes a $23 million curtailment loss for the U.S. plans and $22 million for the non-U.S. plans recognized in the fourth quarter relating to the Companys restructuring actions. (2) The 2006 expense for the U.S. plans includes an $80 million curtailment gain recognized as of September 30, 2006 relating to the Companys decision to freeze benefit accruals for all cash-balance participants after 2007. (3) In addition, the Company absorbed $13 million, $15 million and $20 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to certain investment management fees and administration costs for the U.S. plans, which are excluded from this table. The following table shows the combined postretirement expense and contributions for Citigroups U.S. and foreign plans: U.S. and non-U.S. plans In millions of dollars 2008 2007 2006 Postretirement expense (1) $ 115 $ 69 $ 71 Company contributions 103 72 260 (1) The 2008 expense includes a $6 million curtailment loss related to the Companys fourth-quarter restructuring actions. Expected Rate of Return Citigroup determines its assumptions for the expected rate of return on plan assets for its U.S. pension and postretirement plans using a building block approach, which focuses on ranges of anticipated rates of return for each asset class. A weighted range of nominal rates is then determined based on target allocations to each asset class. Citigroup considers the expected rate of return to be a long-term assessment of return expectations and does not anticipate changing this assumption annually unless there are significant changes in investment strategy or economic conditions. This contrasts with the selection of the discount rate, future compensation increase rate, and certain other assumptions, which are reconsidered annually in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The expected rate of return for the U.S. pension and post-retirement plans was 7.75% at December 31, 2008 and 8.0% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, reflecting the performance of the global capital markets. Actual returns in 2008 were less than the expected returns, while actual returns in 2007 and 2006 were more than the expected returns. This expected amount reflects the expected annual appreciation of the plan assets and reduces the annual pension expense of the Company. It is deducted from the sum of service cost, interest and other components of pension expense to arrive at the net pension (benefit) expense. Net pension (benefit) expense for the U.S. pension plans for 2008, 2007 and 2006 reflects deductions of $949, $889 million and $845 million of expected returns, respectively. 106 Table of Contents FAIR VALUATION The following table shows the expected versus actual rate of return on plan assets for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans: 2008 2007 2006 Expected rate of return 7.75 % 8.0 % 8.0 % Actual rate of return (5.42 )% 13.2 % 14.7 % For the foreign plans, pension expense for 2008 was reduced by the expected return of $487 million, compared with the actual return of $(883) million. Pension expense for 2007 and 2006 was reduced by expected returns of $477 million and $384 million, respectively. Actual returns were higher in 2007 and 2006 than the expected returns in those years. Discount Rate The 2008 and 2007 discount rates for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans were selected by reference to a Citigroup-specific analysis using each plans specific cash flows and compared with the Moodys Aa Long-Term Corporate Bond Yield for reasonableness. Citigroups policy is to round to the nearest tenth of a percent. Accordingly, at December 31, 2008, the discount rate was set at 6.1% for the pension plans and at 6.0% for the postretirement welfare plans. At December 31, 2007, the discount rate was set at 6.2% for the pension plans and 6.0% for the postretirement plans, referencing a Citigroup-specific cash flow analysis. As of September 30, 2006, the U.S. pension plan was remeasured to reflect the freeze of benefits accruals for all non-grandfathered participants, effective January 1, 2008. Under the September 30, 2006 remeasurement and year-end analysis, the resulting plan-specific discount rate for the pension plan was 5.86%, which was rounded to 5.9%. The discount rates for the foreign pension and postretirement plans are selected by reference to high-quality corporate bond rates in countries that have developed corporate bond markets. However, where developed corporate bond markets do not exist, the discount rates are selected by reference to local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the additional risk for corporate bonds. For additional information on the pension and postretirement plans, and on discount rates used in determining pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit expense for the Companys plans, as well as the effects of a one percentage-point change in the expected rates of return and the discount rates, see Note 9 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements on page 143. Adoption of SFAS 158 Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits (SFAS 158), at December 31, 2006, the Company recorded an after-tax charge to equity of $1.6 billion, which corresponds to the plans net pension and postretirement liabilities and the write-off of the existing prepaid asset, which relates to unamortized actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs/benefits and transition assets/liabilities. For a discussion of fair value of assets and liabilities, see Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates on page 18 and Notes 26, 27 and 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 191, 200 and 205. 107 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Corporate Governance Citigroup has a Code of Conduct that maintains the Companys commitment to the highest standards of conduct.

Controls and Procedures Disclosure The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure and appropriate SEC filings. The Companys Disclosure Committee is responsible for ensuring that there is an adequate and effective process for establishing, maintaining and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures for the Companys external disclosures. The Companys management, with the participation of the Companys CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2008 and, based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that at that date the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2008 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

Significant Unconsolidated VIEAn entity where the Company has any variable interest, including those where the likelihood of loss, or the notional amount of exposure, is small. Variable interests are ownership interests, debt securities, contractual arrangements or other pecuniary interests in an entity that absorbs the VIEs expected losses and/or returns. Special Purpose Entity (SPE)An entity in the form of a trust or other legal vehicle, designed to fulfill a specific limited need of the company that organized it (such as a transfer of risk or desired tax treatment). Standby Letter of CreditAn obligation issued by a bank on behalf of a bank customer to a third party where the bank promises to pay the third party, contingent upon the failure by the banks customer to perform under the terms of the underlying contract with the beneficiary, or it obligates the bank to guarantee or stand as a surety for the benefit of the third party to the extent permitted by law or regulation. 110 Table of Contents TARPTroubled Asset Relief Program established by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, under which broad authority was conferred upon the U.S. Department of the Treasury to undertake various programs and initiatives to aid in the restoration of stability and liquidity to U.S. financial markets and strengthen U.S. financial institutions.

Citigroups internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management maintains a comprehensive system of controls intended to ensure that transactions are executed in accordance with managements authorization, assets are safeguarded, and financial records are reliable. Management also takes steps to ensure that information and communication flows are effective and to monitor performance, including performance of internal control procedures. Citigroup management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2008, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been audited by KPMG LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 112, which expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. 112 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Stockholders Citigroup Inc.: We have audited Citigroup Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company or Citigroup) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Citigroup maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Citigroup as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York February 27, 2009 113 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Board of Directors and Stockholders Citigroup Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Citigroup Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company or Citigroup) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, and the related consolidated balance sheets of Citibank, N.A. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Citigroup as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, and the financial position of Citibank, N.A. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2007 the Company changed its methods of accounting for fair value measurements, the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities, uncertainty in income taxes and cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leverage lease transaction. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Citigroups internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York February 27, 2009 114 Table of Contents FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TABLE OF CONTENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated Statement of IncomeFor the Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 116 Consolidated Balance SheetDecember 31, 2008 and 2007 117 Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders EquityFor the Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 118 Consolidated Statement of Cash FlowsFor the Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 120 Consolidated Balance SheetCitibank, N.A. and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2008 and 2007 121 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 122 Note 2  Business Developments 134 Note 3  Discontinued Operations 136 Note 4  Business Segments 138 Note 5  Interest Revenue and Expense 139 Note 6  Commissions and Fees 139 Note 7  Principal Transactions 140 Note 8  Incentive Plans 140 Note 9  Retirement Benefits 144 Note 10  Restructuring 150 Note 11  Income Taxes 152 Note 12  Earnings per Share 155 Note 13  Federal Funds, Securities Borrowed, Loaned, and Subject to Repurchase Agreements 156 Note 14  Brokerage Receivables and Brokerage Payables 157 Note 15  Trading Account Assets and Liabilities 157 Note 16  Investments 158 Note 17  Loans 163 Note 18  Allowance for Credit Losses 165 Note 19  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 166 Note 20  Debt 169 Note 21  Preferred Stock and Stockholders Equity 172 Note 22  Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 174 Note 23  Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities 175 Note 24  Derivatives Activities 189 Note 25  Concentrations of Credit Risk 192 Note 26  Fair-Value Measurement (SFAS 157) 192 Note 27  Fair-Value Elections (SFAS 155, SFAS 156 and SFAS 159) 202 Note 28  Fair Value of Financial Instruments (SFAS 107) 207 Note 29  Pledged Assets, Collateral, Commitments and Guarantees 208 Note 30  Contingencies 214 Note 31  Citibank, N.A.

There is no tax benefit and there is no income statement impact from this adjustment. (2) The adjustment to the opening balance of Retained earnings represents the total of the after-tax gain (loss) amounts for the adoption of the following accounting pronouncements:  SFAS 157 for $75 million,  SFAS 159 for $(99) million,  FSP 13-2 for $(148) million, and  FIN 48 for $(14) million. See Notes 1, 26 and 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 121, 191 and 200, respectively. (3) Common dividends declared were as follows: $0.32 per share in the first, second and third quarters of 2008, $0.16 in the fourth quarter of 2008; $0.54 per share in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2007; $0.49 per share in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2006. (4) All open market repurchases were transacted under an existing authorized share repurchase plan. On April 14, 2005, the Board of Directors authorized up to an additional $15 billion in share repurchases. Additionally, on April 17, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized up to an additional $10 billion in share repurchases. (5) The after-tax adjustment to the opening balance of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) represents the reclassification of the unrealized gains (losses) related to the Legg Mason securities as well as several miscellaneous items previously reported in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS 115). The related unrealized gains and losses were reclassified to Retained earnings upon the adoption of the fair value option in accordance with SFAS 157 and SFAS 159. See Notes 1, 26 and 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 121, 191 and 200 for further discussion. (6) In 2008, reflects decreased fair value of plan assets and a lower discount rate, which increased the PBO (Projected Benefit Obligation).

See Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 121 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Citigroup and its subsidiaries (the Company). The Company consolidates subsidiaries in which it holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or where it exercises control. Entities where the Company holds 20% to 50% of the voting rights and/or has the ability to exercise significant influence, other than investments of designated venture capital subsidiaries, or investments accounted for at fair value under the fair value option, are accounted for under the equity method, and the pro rata share of their income (loss) is included in Other revenue. Income from investments in less than 20%-owned companies is recognized when dividends are received. As discussed below, Citigroup consolidates entities deemed to be variable interest entities when Citigroup is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Gains and losses on the disposition of branches, subsidiaries, affiliates, buildings, and other investments and charges for managements estimate of impairment in their value that is other than temporary, such that recovery of the carrying amount is deemed unlikely, are included in Other revenue. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior-periods financial statements and notes to conform to the current periods presentation. Citibank, N.A. Citibank, N.A. is a commercial bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. Citibanks principal offerings include consumer finance, mortgage lending, and retail banking products and services; investment banking, commercial banking, cash management, trade finance and e-commerce products and services; and private banking products and services. The Company includes a balance sheet and statement of changes in stockholders equity for Citibank, N.A. to provide information about this entity to shareholders and international regulatory agencies. (See Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 212.) Variable Interest Entities An entity is referred to as a variable interest entity (VIE) if it meets the criteria outlined in FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (revised December 2003) FIN 46(R), which are: (1) the entity has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) the entity has equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entitys operations or that do not absorb their proportionate share of the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity. In addition, as specified in FIN 46(R), a VIE must be consolidated by the Company if it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, which is the party involved with the VIE that has a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns or both. Along with the VIEs that are consolidated in accordance with these guidelines, the Company has significant variable interests in other VIEs that are not consolidated because the Company is not the primary beneficiary. These include multi-seller finance companies, certain collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), many structured finance transactions, and various investment funds. However, these VIEs as well as all other unconsolidated VIEs are regularly monitored by the Company to determine if any reconsideration events have occurred that could cause its primary beneficiary status to change. These events include:  additional purchases or sales of variable interests by Citigroup or an unrelated third party, which cause Citigroups overall variable interest ownership to change;  changes in contractual arrangements in a manner that reallocates expected losses and residual returns among the variable interest holders; and  providing support to an entity that results in an implicit variable interest. All other entities not deemed to be VIEs with which the Company has involvement are evaluated for consolidation under Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, SFAS No. 94, Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries (SFAS 94), and EITF Issue No. 04-5. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end spot foreign exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated monthly at amounts that approximate weighted average exchange rates, with resulting gains and losses included in income. The effects of translating net assets with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are included in a separate component of stockholders equity along with related hedge and tax effects. The effects of translating income with the U.S. dollar as the functional currency, including those in highly inflationary environments, are primarily included in Other revenue along with the related hedge effects. Hedges of foreign currency exposures include forward foreign currency, option and swap contracts and designated issues of non-U.S. dollar debt. Investment Securities Investments include fixed income and equity securities. Fixed income instruments include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stocks, as well as certain loan-backed and structured securities that are subject to prepayment risk. Equity securities include common and nonredeemable preferred stocks. Investment securities are classified and accounted for as follows:  Fixed income securities classified as held to maturity represent securities that the Company has both the ability and the intent to hold until maturity, and are carried at amortized cost. Interest income on such securities is included in Interest revenue.  Fixed income securities and marketable equity securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in a separate component of Stockholders equity, net of applicable income taxes. As set out in Note 16 on page 157, declines in 122 Table of Contents fair value that are determined to be other than temporary are recorded in earnings immediately. Realized gains and losses on sales are included in income primarily on a specific identification cost basis, and interest and dividend income on such securities is included in Interest revenue.  Venture capital investments held by Citigroups private equity subsidiaries that are considered investment companies are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in Other revenue. These subsidiaries include entities registered as Small Business Investment Companies and engage exclusively in venture capital activities.  Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities and certain investments that would otherwise have been accounted for using the equity method are carried at fair value, since the Company has elected to apply fair value accounting in accordance with SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). Changes in fair value of such investments are recorded in earnings.  Certain non-marketable equity securities are carried at cost and periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment, as set out in Note 16 on page 157. For investments in fixed-income securities classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, accrual of interest income is suspended for investments that are in default or on which it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. The Company uses a number of valuation techniques for investments carried at fair value, which are described in Note 27 on page 200. Trading Account Assets and Liabilities Trading account assets include debt and marketable equity securities, derivatives in a receivable position, residual interests in securitizations and physical commodities inventory. In addition (as set out in Note 27 on page 200), certain assets that Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value under SFAS 159, such as loans and purchased guarantees, are also included in Trading account assets. Trading account liabilities include securities sold, not yet purchased (short positions), and derivatives in a net payable position, as well as certain liabilities that Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value under SFAS 159 or SFAS 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments (SFAS 155) as set out in Note 27 on page 200. Other than physical commodities inventory, all trading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Revenues generated from trading assets and trading liabilities are generally reported in Principal transactions and include realized gains and losses as well as unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of such instruments. Interest income on trading assets is recorded in Interest revenue reduced by interest expense on trading liabilities. Physical commodities inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market (LOCOM) with related gains or losses reported in Principal transactions. Realized gains and losses on sales of commodities inventory are included in Principal transactions on a first in, first out basis. Derivatives used for trading purposes include interest rate, currency, equity, credit, and commodity swap agreements, options, caps and floors, warrants, and financial and commodity futures and forward contracts. Derivative asset and liability positions are presented net by counterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when a valid master netting agreement exists and the other conditions set out in FASB Interpretation No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts (FIN 39) are met. The Company uses a number of techniques to determine the fair value of trading assets and liabilities, all of which are described in Note 26 on page 191. Securities Borrowed and Securities Loaned Securities borrowing and lending transactions generally do not constitute a sale of the underlying securities for accounting purposes, and so are treated as collateralized financing transactions when the transaction involves the exchange of cash. Such transactions are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received plus accrued interest. As set out in Note 27 on page 200, the Company has elected under SFAS 159 to apply fair value accounting to a number of securities borrowing and lending transactions. Irrespective of whether the Company has elected fair-value accounting, fees paid or received for all securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded in Interest expense or Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate. Where the conditions of FIN 39 are met, amounts recognized in respect of securities borrowed and securities loaned are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. With respect to securities borrowed or loaned, the Company pays or receives cash collateral in an amount in excess of the market value of securities borrowed or loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral received or paid as necessary. As described in Note 26 on page 191, the Company uses a discounted cash-flow technique to determine the fair value of securities lending and borrowing transactions. Repurchase and Resale Agreements Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repos) and securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos) generally do not constitute a sale for accounting purposes of the underlying securities, and so are treated as collateralized financing transactions. As set out in Note 27 on page 200, the Company has elected to apply fair-value accounting to a majority of such transactions, with changes in fair-value reported in earnings. Any transactions for which fair-value accounting has not been elected are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received plus accrued interest. Irrespective of whether the Company has elected fair-value accounting, interest paid or received on all repo and reverse repo transactions is recorded in Interest expense or Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate. Where the conditions of FASB Interpretation No. 41, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements (FIN 41), are met, repos and reverse repos are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Companys policy is to take possession of securities purchased under agreements to resell. The market value of securities to be repurchased and resold is monitored, and additional collateral is obtained where appropriate to protect against credit exposure. As described in Note 26 on page 191, the Company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of repo and reverse repo transactions. Loans Loans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income and unamortized deferred fees and costs. Loan origination 123 Table of Contents fees and certain direct origination costs are generally deferred and recognized as adjustments to income over the lives of the related loans. As set out in Note 27 on page 200, the Company has elected fair value accounting under SFAS 159 and SFAS 155 for certain loans. Such loans are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. Interest income on such loans is recorded in Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate. Loans for which the fair value option has not been elected under SFAS 159 or SFAS 155 are classified upon origination or acquisition as either held-for-investment or held-for-sale. This classification is based on managements intent and ability with regard to those loans. Substantially all of the consumer loans sold or securitized by Citigroup are U.S. prime mortgage loans or U.S. credit card receivables. The practice of the U.S. prime mortgage business has been to sell all of its loans except for nonconforming adjustable rate loans. U.S. prime mortgage conforming loans are classified as held-for-sale at the time of origination. The related cash flows are classified in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the cash flows from operating activities category on the line Change in loans held-for-sale. U.S. credit card receivables are classified at origination as loans-held-for sale to the extent that management does not have the intent to hold the receivables for the foreseeable future or until maturity. The U.S. credit card securitization forecast for the three months following the latest balance sheet date is the basis for the amount of such loans classified as held-for-sale. Cash flows related to U.S. credit card loans classified as held-for-sale at origination or acquisition are reported in the cash flows from operating activities category on the line Change in loans held-for-sale. Loans that are held-for-investment are classified as Loans, net of unearned income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related cash flows are included within the cash flows from investing activities category in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line Changes in loans. However, when the initial intent for holding a loan has changed from held-for-investment to held-for-sale, the loan is reclassified to held-for-sale, but the related cash flows continue to be reported in cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line Proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans. Consumer Loans Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed by the Global Cards and Consumer Banking businesses and GWM. As a general rule, interest accrual ceases for open-end revolving and closed-end installment and real estate loans when payments are 90 days contractually past due. For credit cards, however, the Company accrues interest until payments are 180 days past due. As a general rule, unsecured closed-end installment loans are charged off at 120 days past due and unsecured open-end (revolving) loans are charged off at 180 days contractually past due. Loans secured with non-real-estate collateral are written down to the estimated value of the collateral, less costs to sell, at 120 days past due. Real-estate secured loans (both open- and closed-end) are written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs to sell, at 180 days contractually past due. In certain consumer businesses in the U.S., secured real estate loans are written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs to sell, at the earlier of the receipt of title or 12 months in foreclosure (a process that must commence when payments are 120 days contractually past due). Closed-end loans secured by non-real-estate collateral are written down to the estimated value of the collateral, less costs to sell, at 180 days contractually past due. Unsecured loans (both open- and closed-end) are charged off at 180 days contractually past due and 180 days from the last payment, but in no event can these loans exceed 360 days contractually past due. Unsecured loans in bankruptcy are charged off within 30 days of notification of filing by the bankruptcy court or within the contractual write-off periods, whichever occurs earlier. In CitiFinancial, unsecured loans in bankruptcy are charged off when they are 30 days contractually past due. Corporate Loans Corporate loans represent loans and leases managed by ICG. Corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a cash (non-accrual) basis when it is determined that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days past due, except when the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection. Any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is reversed at 90 days and charged against current earnings, and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually received in cash. When there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of principal, all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan. Impaired corporate loans and leases are written down to the extent that principal is judged to be uncollectible. Impaired collateral-dependent loans and leases, where repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment, are written down to the lower of cost or collateral value. Cash-basis loans are returned to an accrual status when all contractual principal and interest amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there is a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual terms. Lease Financing Transactions Loans include the Companys share of aggregate rentals on lease financing transactions and residual values net of related unearned income. Lease financing transactions represent direct financing leases and also include leveraged leases. Unearned income is amortized under a method that results in an approximate level rate of return when related to the unrecovered lease investment. Gains and losses from sales of residual values of leased equipment are included in Other revenue. Loans Held-for-Sale Corporate and consumer loans that have been identified for sale are classified as loans held-for-sale included in Other assets. With the exception of certain mortgage loans for which the fair-value option has been elected under SFAS 159, these loans are accounted for at the lower of cost or market value, with any write-downs or subsequent recoveries charged to Other revenue. Allowance for Loan Losses Allowance for loan losses represents managements estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio. Attribution of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only, and the entire allowance is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the overall portfolio. Additions to the allowance are made through the provision for credit losses. Credit losses are deducted from the allowance, and subsequent recoveries are added. Securities received in exchange for loan claims in debt restructurings are initially recorded at fair value, with any gain or loss reflected as a recovery or 124 Table of Contents charge-off to the allowance, and are subsequently accounted for as securities available-for-sale. In the Corporate portfolios, larger-balance, non-homogeneous exposures representing significant individual credit exposures are evaluated based upon the borrowers overall financial condition, resources, and payment record, the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. Reserves are established for these loans based upon an estimate of probable losses for the individual loans deemed to be impaired. This estimate considers all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans contractual effective rate, the secondary market value of the loan and the fair value of collateral less disposal costs. The allowance for credit losses attributed to the remaining portfolio is established via a process that estimates the probable loss inherent in the portfolio based upon various analyses. These analyses consider historical and project default rates and loss severities, internal risk ratings, and geographic, industry, and other environmental factors. Management also considers overall portfolio indicators, including trends in internally risk-rated exposures, classified exposures, cash-basis loans, historical and forecasted write-offs, and a review of industry, geographic, and portfolio concentrations, including current developments within those segments. In addition, management considers the current business strategy and credit process, including credit limit setting and compliance, credit approvals, loan underwriting criteria, and loan workout procedures. For Consumer loans, each portfolio of smaller-balance, homogeneous loansincluding consumer mortgage, installment, revolving credit, and most other consumer loansis collectively evaluated for impairment. The allowance for loan losses attributed to these loans is established via a process that estimates the probable losses inherent in the portfolio based upon various analyses. These include migration analysis, in which historical delinquency and credit loss experience is applied to the current aging of the portfolio, together with analyses that reflect current trends and conditions. Management also considers overall portfolio indicators, including historical credit losses, delinquent, non-performing, and classified loans, trends in volumes and terms of loans, an evaluation of overall credit quality, the credit process, including lending policies and procedures, and economic, geographical, product and other environmental factors. In addition, valuation allowances are determined for impaired smaller-balance homogenous loans whose terms have been modified due to the borrowers financial difficulties and it was determined that a concession was granted to the borrower. Such modifications may include interest rate reductions, principal forgiveness and/or term extensions. These allowances are determined by comparing estimated cash flows of the loans discounted at the loans original contractual interest rates to the carrying value of the loans. Allowance for Unfunded Lending Commitments A similar approach to the allowance for loan losses is used for calculating a reserve for the expected losses related to unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit. This reserve is classified on the balance sheet in Other liabilities. Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), which are included in Intangible assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, are recognized as assets when purchased or when the Company sells or securitizes loans acquired through purchase or origination and retains the right to service the loans. With the Companys electing to early-adopt SFAS 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets, as of January 1, 2006, MSRs in the U.S. mortgage and student loan classes of servicing rights are accounted for at fair value, with changes in value recorded in current earnings. Upon electing the fair-value method of accounting for its MSRs, the Company discontinued the application of SFAS 133 fair-value hedge accounting, the calculation of amortization and the assessment of impairment for the MSRs. The MSR valuation allowance at the date of adoption of SFAS 156 was written off against the recorded value of the MSRs. Prior to 2006, only the portion of the MSR portfolio that was hedged with instruments qualifying for hedge accounting under SFAS 133 was recorded at fair value. The remaining portion, which was hedged with instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133, was accounted for at the lower of cost or market. Servicing rights retained in the securitization of mortgage loans were measured by allocating the carrying value of the loans between the assets sold and the interests retained, based on the relative fair values at the date of securitization. MSRs were amortized using a proportionate cash flow method over the period of the related net positive servicing income to be generated from the various portfolios purchased or loans originated. Impairment of MSRs was evaluated on a disaggregated basis by type (i.e., fixed rate or adjustable rate) and by interest-rate band, which were believed to be the predominant risk characteristics of the Companys servicing portfolio. Any excess of the carrying value of the capitalized servicing rights over the fair value by stratum was recognized through a valuation allowance for each stratum and charged to the provision for impairment on MSRs. Additional information on the Companys MSRs can be found in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 174. Goodwill Goodwill represents an acquired companys acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, whereby Goodwill is allocated to the Companys reporting units and an impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Furthermore, on any business dispositions, Goodwill is allocated to the business disposed of based on the ratio of the fair value of the business disposed of to the fair value of the reporting unit. Intangible Assets Intangible assetsincluding core deposit intangibles, present value of future profits, purchased credit card relationships, other customer relationships, and other intangible assets, but excluding MSRsare amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, primarily certain asset management contracts and trade names, are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests. An impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. For other Intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the Intangible asset. Other Assets and Other Liabilities Other assets includes, among other items, loans held-for-sale, deferred tax assets, equity-method investments, interest and fees receivable, premises and 125 Table of Contents equipment, end-user derivatives in a net receivable position, repossessed assets, and other receivables. Other liabilities includes, among other items, accrued expenses and other payables, deferred tax liabilities, minority interest, end-user derivatives in a net payable position, and reserves for legal, taxes, restructuring, unfunded lending commitments, and other matters. Repossessed Assets Upon repossession, loans are adjusted, if necessary, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and transferred to repossessed assets. This is reported in Other assets, net of a valuation allowance for selling costs and net declines in value as appropriate. Securitizations The Company primarily securitizes credit card receivables and mortgages. Other types of securitized assets include corporate debt instruments (in cash and synthetic form) and student loans. There are two key accounting determinations that must be made relating to securitizations. First, in the case where Citigroup originated or owned the financial assets transferred to the securitization entity, a decision must be made as to whether that transfer is considered a sale under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). If it is a sale, the transferred assets are removed from the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet with a gain or loss recognized. Alternatively, when the transfer would be considered to be a financing rather than a sale, the assets will remain on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet with an offsetting liability recognized in the amount of proceeds received. Second, a determination must be made as to whether the securitization entity would be included in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. For each securitization entity with which it is involved, the Company makes a determination of whether the entity should be considered a subsidiary of the Company and be included in its Consolidated Financial Statements or whether the entity is sufficiently independent that it does not need to be consolidated. If the securitization entitys activities are sufficiently restricted to meet accounting requirements to be a qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE), the securitization entity is not consolidated by the seller of the transferred assets. If the securitization entity is determined to be a VIE, the Company consolidates the VIE if it is the primary beneficiary. For all other securitization entities determined not to be VIEs in which Citigroup participates, a consolidation decision is made by evaluating several factors, including how much of the entitys ownership is in the hands of third-party investors, who controls the securitization entity, and who reaps the rewards and bears the risks of the entity. Only securitization entities controlled by Citigroup are consolidated. Interests in the securitized and sold assets may be retained in the form of subordinated interest-only strips, subordinated tranches, spread accounts, and servicing rights. In credit card securitizations, the Company retains a sellers interest in the credit card receivables transferred to the trusts, which is not in securitized form. Accordingly, the sellers interest is carried on a historical cost basis and classified as Consumer loans. Retained interests in securitized mortgage loans and student loans are classified as Trading account assets, as is a majority of the retained interests in securitized credit card receivables. Certain other retained interests are recorded as available-for-sale investments, but servicing rights are included in Intangible assets. However, since January 1, 2006, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value. Gains or losses on securitization and sale depend in part on the previous carrying amount of the loans involved in the transfer and, prior to January 1, 2006, were allocated between the loans sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair values at the date of sale. Gains are recognized at the time of securitization and are reported in Other revenue. The Company values its securitized retained interests at fair value using quoted market prices, if such positions are actively traded, or financial models that incorporate observable and unobservable inputs. More specifically, these models estimate the fair value of these retained interests by determining the present value of expected future cash flows, using modeling techniques that incorporate managements best estimates of key assumptions, including prepayment speeds, credit losses and discount rates, when observable inputs are not available. In addition, internally calculated fair values of retained interests are compared to recent sales of similar assets, if available. Additional information on the Companys securitization activities can be found in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 174. Transfers of Financial Assets For a transfer of financial assets to be considered a sale, the assets must have been isolated from the Company, even in bankruptcy or other receivership; the purchaser must have the right to sell the assets transferred or the purchaser must be a QSPE; and the Company may not have an option or any obligation to reacquire the assets. If these sale requirements are met, the assets are removed from the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. If the conditions for sale are not met, the transfer is considered to be a secured borrowing, the assets remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the sale proceeds are recognized as the Companys liability. A legal opinion on a sale is generally obtained for complex transactions or where the Company has continuing involvement with assets transferred or with the securitization entity. For a transfer to be eligible for sale accounting, those opinions must state that the asset transfer is considered a sale and that the assets transferred would not be consolidated with the Companys other assets in the event of the Companys insolvency. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 174. Risk Management ActivitiesDerivatives Used for Non-Trading Purposes The Company manages its exposures to market rate movements outside its trading activities by modifying the asset and liability mix, either directly or through the use of derivative financial products, including interest rate swaps, futures, forwards, and purchased option positions, as well as foreign-exchange contracts. These end-user derivatives are carried at fair value in Other assets or Other liabilities. To qualify as a hedge, a derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being hedged. The hedge relationship must be formally documented at inception, detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge, which includes the item and risk that is being hedged and the derivative that is being used, as well as how effectiveness will be assessed and ineffectiveness measured. The effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated on a retrospective and prospective basis, typically using quantitative measures of correlation with hedge ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings. If a hedge relationship is found to be ineffective, it no longer qualifies as a hedge and 126 Table of Contents any gains or losses attributable to the derivatives, as well as subsequent changes in fair value, are recognized in Other revenue. The foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized basis, consistent with the level at which market risk is managed, but are subject to various limits and controls. The underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio of similar items. For fair value hedges, in which derivatives hedge the fair value of assets or liabilities, changes in the fair value of derivatives are reflected in Other revenue, together with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item. These are expected to, and generally do, offset each other. Any net amount, representing hedge ineffectiveness, is reflected in current earnings. Citigroups fair value hedges are primarily hedges of fixed-rate long-term debt, and available-for-sale securities. For cash flow hedges, in which derivatives hedge the variability of cash flows related to floating- and fixed-rate assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions, the accounting treatment depends on the effectiveness of the hedge. To the extent these derivatives are effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows, the effective portion of the changes in the derivatives fair values will not be included in current earnings, but are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These changes in fair value will be included in earnings of future periods when the hedged cash flows come into earnings. To the extent these derivatives are not effective, changes in their fair values are immediately included in Other revenue. Citigroups cash flow hedges primarily include hedges of floating and fixed rate debt, as well as rollovers of short-term fixed rate liabilities and floating-rate liabilities. For net investment hedges in which derivatives hedge the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, the accounting treatment will similarly depend on the effectiveness of the hedge. The effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative, including any forward premium or discount, is reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment. End-user derivatives that are economic hedges, rather than qualifying for SFAS 133 hedge accounting, are also carried at fair value, with changes in value included in Principal transactions or Other revenue. Citigroup often uses economic hedges when qualifying for hedge accounting would be too complex or operationally burdensome; examples are hedges of the credit risk component of commercial loans and loan commitments. Citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other areas and may designate either a qualifying hedge or an economic hedge, after considering the relative cost and benefits. Economic hedges are also employed when the hedged item itself is marked to market through current earnings, such as hedges of commitments to originate one-to-four-family mortgage loans to be held-for-sale and mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). For those hedge relationships that are terminated or when hedge designations are removed, the hedge accounting treatment described in the paragraphs above is no longer applied. Instead, the end-user derivative is terminated or transferred to the trading account. For fair-value hedges, any changes in the fair value of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately reflected as an element of the yield. For cash-flow hedges, any changes in fair-value of the end-user derivative remain in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are included in earnings of future periods when the hedged cash flows impact earnings. However, if the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer likely to occur, any changes in fair value of the end-user derivative are immediately reflected in Other revenue. Employee Benefits Expense Employee benefits expense includes current service costs of pension and other postretirement benefit plans, which are accrued on a current basis, contributions and unrestricted awards under other employee plans, the amortization of restricted stock awards and costs of other employee benefits. Stock-Based Compensation Under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123), the Company recognizes compensation expense over the related service period based on the grant date fair value of the stock award. On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which replaced the existing SFAS 123 and APB 25. See Accounting Changes on page 128. Income Taxes The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, the Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. The Company must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review/adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. The Company implemented FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), on January 1, 2007, which sets out a consistent framework to determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions. See Accounting Changes on page 128. The Company treats interest and penalties on income taxes as a component of Income tax expense. Deferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that have been recognized for financial statements or tax returns, based upon enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to managements judgment that realization is more likely than not. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 151 for a further description of the Companys provision and related income tax assets and liabilities. Commissions, Underwriting and Principal Transactions Commissions, underwriting and principal transactions revenues and related expenses are recognized in income on a trade-date basis. Earnings per Share Earnings per share is computed after recognition of preferred stock dividend requirements. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, excluding restricted stock. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised. It is 127 Table of Contents computed after giving consideration to the weighted average dilutive effect of the Companys stock options and the shares issued under the Companys Capital Accumulation Program and other restricted stock plans. Use of Estimates Management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related footnote disclosures. Such estimates are used in connection with certain fair value measurements. See Note 26 on page 191 for further discussions on estimates used in the determination of fair value. The Company also uses estimates in determining consolidation decisions for special purpose entities as discussed in Note 23 on page 174. Moreover, estimates are significant in determining the amounts of other-than-temporary impairments, impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, provisions for potential losses that may arise from credit-related exposures and probable and estimable losses related to litigation and regulatory proceedings in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and tax reserves in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, and SFAS 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan. While management makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from those estimates. Current market conditions increase the risk and complexity of the judgments in these estimates. Cash Flows Cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks. Cash flows from risk management activities are classified in the same category as the related assets and liabilities. Related Party Transactions The Company has related party transactions with certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates. These transactions, which are primarily short-term in nature, include cash accounts, collateralized financing transactions, margin accounts, derivative trading, charges for operational support and the borrowing and lending of funds and are entered into in the ordinary course of business. 128 Table of Contents ACCOUNTING CHANGES Sale with Repurchase Financing Agreements In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 140-3, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets and Repurchase Financing Transactions. This FSP provides implementation guidance on whether a security transfer with a contemporaneous repurchase financing involving the transferred financial asset must be evaluated as one linked transaction or two separate de-linked transactions. The FSP requires the recognition of the transfer and the repurchase agreement as one linked transaction, unless all of the following criteria are met: (1) the initial transfer and the repurchase financing are not contractually contingent on one another; (2) the initial transferor has full recourse upon default, and the repurchase agreements price is fixed and not at fair value; (3) the financial asset is readily obtainable in the marketplace and the transfer and repurchase financing are executed at market rates; and (4) the maturity of the repurchase financing is before the maturity of the financial asset. The scope of this FSP is limited to transfers and subsequent repurchase financings that are entered into contemporaneously or in contemplation of one another. The FSP becomes effective for Citigroup on January 1, 2009. The impact of adopting this FSP is not expected to be material. Enhanced Disclosures of Credit Derivative Instruments and Guarantees In September 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4, Disclosures about Credit Derivatives and Certain Guarantees: An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB Interpretation No. 45, and Clarification of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 161, which requires additional disclosures for sellers of credit derivative instruments and certain guarantees. This FSP requires the disclosure of the maximum potential amount of future payments, the related fair value, and the current status of the payment/performance risk for certain guarantees and credit derivatives sold. Determining Fair Value in Inactive Markets In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-3, Determining Fair Value of Financial Assets When the Market for That Asset is Not Active. The FSP clarifies that companies can use internal assumptions to determine the fair value of a financial asset when markets are inactive, and do not necessarily have to rely on broker quotes. The FSP confirms a joint statement by the FASB and the SEC in which they stated that companies can use internal assumptions when relevant market information does not exist and provides an example of how to determine the fair value for a financial asset in a non-active market. The FASB emphasized that the FSP is not new guidance, but rather clarifies the principles in SFAS 157. Revisions resulting from a change in the valuation technique or its application should be accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. The FSP was effective upon issuance and did not have a material impact. Measurement of Impairment for Certain Securities In January 2009, the FASB issued FSP EITF 99-20-1, Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue 99-20, to achieve more consistent determination of whether other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale or held-to-maturity debt securities have occurred. This FSP aligns the impairment model of Issue No. 99-20 with that of FASB Statement 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. SFAS 115 requires entities to assess whether it is probable that the holder will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms. The FSP eliminates the requirement to consider market participants views of cash flows of a security in determining whether or not impairment has occurred. The FSP is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2008 and applied prospectively. The impact of adopting this FSP was not material. SEC Staff Guidance on Loan Commitments Recorded at Fair Value through Earnings On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 109 (SAB 109), which requires that the fair value of a written loan commitment that is marked-to-market through earnings should include the future cash flows related to the loans servicing rights. However, the fair value measurement of a written loan commitment still must exclude the expected net cash flows related to internally-developed intangible assets (such as customer relationship intangible assets). SAB 109 applies to two types of loan commitments: (1) written mortgage loan commitments for loans that will be held-for-sale when funded that are marked to market as derivatives under SFAS 133 (derivative loan commitments); and (2) other written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings under SFAS 159s fair-value election. SAB 109 supersedes SAB 105, which applied only to derivative loan commitments and allowed the expected future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan to be recognized only after the servicing asset had been contractually separated from the underlying loan by sale or securitization of the loan with servicing retained. SAB 109 was applied prospectively to loan commitments issued or modified in fiscal quarters beginning after December 15, 2007. The impact of adopting this SAB was not material. Netting of Cash Collateral against Derivative Exposures During April 2007, the FASB issued FSP FIN 39-1, Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39 (FSP FIN 39-1) modifying certain provisions of FIN 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts. This amendment clarified the acceptability of the existing market practice of offsetting the amounts recorded for cash collateral receivables or payables against the fair value amounts recognized for net derivative positions executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement, which was the Companys prior accounting practice. Thus, this amendment did not affect the Companys consolidated financial statements. Adoption of SFAS 157Fair Value Measurements The Company elected to early-adopt SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), as of January 1, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value, expands disclosure requirements around fair value and specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Companys market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: 129 Table of Contents  Level 1Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.  Level 2Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.  Level 3Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. For some products or in certain market conditions, observable inputs may not always be available. For example, during the market dislocations that started in the second half of 2007, certain markets became illiquid, and some key observable inputs used in valuing certain exposures were unavailable. When and if these markets become liquid, the valuation of these exposures will use the related observable inputs available at that time from these markets. Under SFAS 157, Citigroup is required to take into account its own credit risk when measuring the fair value of derivative positions as well as the other liabilities for which fair value accounting has been elected under SFAS 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments and SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The adoption of SFAS 157 has also resulted in some other changes to the valuation techniques used by Citigroup when determining fair value, most notably the changes to the way that the probability of default of a counterparty is factored in and the elimination of a derivative valuation adjustment which is no longer necessary under SFAS 157. The cumulative effect at January 1, 2007 of making these changes was a gain of $250 million after-tax ($402 million pretax), or $0.05 per diluted share, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2007 earnings within the S&B business. SFAS 157 also precludes the use of block discounts for instruments traded in an active market, which were previously applied to large holdings of publicly traded equity securities, and requires the recognition of trade-date gains after consideration of all appropriate valuation adjustments related to certain derivative trades that use unobservable inputs in determining their fair value. Previous accounting guidance allowed the use of block discounts in certain circumstances and prohibited the recognition of day-one gains on certain derivative trades when determining the fair value of instruments not traded in an active market. The cumulative effect of these changes resulted in an increase to January 1, 2007 retained earnings of $75 million. Fair Value Option (SFAS 159) In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 157, the Company early-adopted SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159), as of January 1, 2007. SFAS 159 provides an option on an instrument-by-instrument basis for most financial assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. After the initial adoption, the election is made at the acquisition of a financial asset, a financial liability, or a firm commitment and it may not be revoked. SFAS 159 provides an opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings that resulted prior to its adoption from being required to apply fair value accounting to certain economic hedges (e.g., derivatives) while having to measure the assets and liabilities being economically hedged using an accounting method other than fair value. Under the SFAS 159 transition provisions, the Company elected to apply fair value accounting to certain financial instruments held at January 1, 2007 with future changes in value reported in earnings. The adoption of SFAS 159 resulted in a decrease to January 1, 2007 retained earnings of $99 million. Leveraged Leases On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FSP FAS 13-2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leverage Lease Transaction (FSP 13-2), which provides guidance regarding changes or projected changes in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction. Leveraged leases can provide significant tax benefits to the lessor, primarily as a result of the timing of tax payments. Since changes in the timing and/or amount of these tax benefits may have a significant effect on the cash flows of a lease transaction, a lessor, in accordance with FSP 13-2, will be required to perform a recalculation of a leveraged lease when there is a change or projected change in the timing of the realization of tax benefits generated by that lease. Previously, Citigroup did not recalculate the tax benefits if only the timing of cash flows had changed. The adoption of FSP 13-2 resulted in a decrease to January 1, 2007 retained earnings of $148 million. This decrease to retained earnings will be recognized in earnings over the remaining lives of the leases as tax benefits are realized. Accounting for Defined Benefit Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits As of December 31, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits (SFAS 158). In accordance with this standard, Citigroup recorded the funded status of each of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or liability on its Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding offset, net of taxes, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Stockholders equity, resulting in an after-tax decrease in equity of $1.647 billion. See Note 9 on page 143. The following table shows the effects of adopting SFAS 158 at December 31, 2006 on individual line items in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2006: In millions of dollars Before application ofSFAS 158 Adjustments Afterapplicationof SFAS 158 Other assets Prepaid benefit cost $ 2,620 $ (534 ) $ 2,086 Other liabilities Accrued benefit liability $  $ 2,147 $ 2,147 Deferred taxes, net $ 3,653 $ 1,034 $ 4,687 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ (2,053 ) $ (1,647 ) (1) $ (3,700 ) Total stockholders equity $ 121,430 $ (1,647 ) (1) $ 119,783 (1) Adjustment to initially apply SFAS 158, net of taxes. 130 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which replaced the existing SFAS 123 and APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123(R) requires companies to measure compensation expense for stock options and other share-based payments based on the instruments grant date fair value, and to record expense based on that fair value reduced by expected forfeitures. The Company adopted this standard by using the modified prospective approach. Beginning January 1, 2006, Citigroup recorded incremental expense for stock options granted prior to January 1, 2003 (the date the Company adopted SFAS 123). That expense equaled the remaining unvested portion of the grant date fair value of those stock options, reduced by forfeitures. The Company maintains a number of incentive programs in which equity awards are granted to eligible employees. The most significant is the Capital Accumulation Program (CAP). Under CAP, the Company grants deferred and restricted shares to eligible employees. The program provides that employees who meet certain age plus years-of-service requirements (retirement-eligible employees) may terminate active employment and continue vesting in their awards provided they comply with specified non-compete provisions. For awards granted to retirement-eligible employees prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company has been and will continue to amortize the compensation cost of these awards over the full vesting periods. Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees after the adoption of SFAS 123(R) must be either expensed on the grant date or accrued in the year prior to the grant date. The impact to 2006 was a charge of $648 million ($398 million after tax) for the immediate expensing of awards granted to retirement-eligible employees in January 2006, and $824 million ($526 million after tax) for the accrual of the awards that were granted in January 2007. The impact to 2007 was $467 million ($290 million after tax) for awards granted in January 2008. The impact to 2008 was $110 million ($68 million after tax) for awards granted in January 2009. In adopting SFAS 123(R), the Company began to recognize compensation expense for restricted or deferred stock awards net of estimated forfeitures. Previously, the effects of forfeitures were recorded as they occurred. SFAS 123(R) requires that compensation cost for all stock awards be calculated and recognized over the employees service period (which is generally equal to the vesting period). For stock options, the compensation cost is determined using option pricing models intended to estimate the fair value of the awards at the grant date. Under SFAS 123(R), an offsetting increase to stockholders equity is recorded equal to the amount of compensation expense. Earnings per share dilution is recognized as well. The Company has made changes to various stock-based compensation plan provisions for future awards. For example, in January 2005, the Company largely moved from granting stock options to granting restricted and deferred stock awards, unless participants elect to receive all or a portion of their award in the form of stock options. Thus, the majority of management options granted since 2005 were due to stock option elections and carried the same vesting period as the restricted or deferred stock awards in lieu of which they were granted (ratably, over four years). Stock options granted since January 1, 2003, generally have three- or four-year vesting periods and six-year terms. In addition, the sale of underlying shares acquired upon the exercise of options granted since January 1, 2003 is restricted for a two-year period. Pursuant to a stock ownership commitment, senior executives are generally required to retain 75% of the shares they own and acquire from the Company over the term of their employment. Options granted in 2003 and thereafter do not have a reload feature; however, reload options received upon the exercise of options granted prior to January 1, 2003 (and subsequent reload options stemming from such grants) retain a reload feature. See Note 8 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements on page 139. Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments On January 1, 2006, the Company elected to early-adopt, primarily on a prospective basis, SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments (SFAS 155). In accordance with this standard, hybrid financial instrumentssuch as structured notes containing embedded derivatives that otherwise would require bifurcation, as well as certain interest-only instrumentsmay be accounted for at fair value if the Company makes an irrevocable election to do so on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings. The impact of adopting this standard was not material. Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets On January 1, 2006, the Company elected to early-adopt SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets (SFAS 156). This pronouncement requires all servicing rights to be initially recognized at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, it permits a one-time irrevocable election to remeasure each class of servicing rights at fair value, with the changes in fair value being recorded in current earnings. The classes of servicing rights are identified based on the availability of market inputs used in determining their fair values and the methods for managing their risks. The Company has elected fair value accounting for its mortgage and student loan classes of servicing rights. The impact of adopting this standard was not material. 131 Table of Contents FUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(revised), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)), which is designed to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. This Statement replaces SFAS 141, Business Combinations. SFAS 141(R) retains the fundamental requirements in Statement 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (which Statement 141 called the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. SFAS 141(R) also retains the guidance in SFAS 141 for identifying and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill. The most significant changes in SFAS 141(R) are: (1) acquisition costs and restructuring costs will now be expensed; (2) stock consideration will be measured based on the quoted market price as of the acquisition date instead of the date the deal is announced; (3) contingent consideration arising from contractual and noncontractual contingencies that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold will be measured and recognized as an asset or liability at fair value at the acquisition date using a probability-weighted discounted cash flows model, with subsequent changes in fair value reflected in earnings; noncontractual contingencies that do not meet the more-likely- than-not criteria will continue to be recognized when they are probable and reasonably estimable; and (4) acquirer will record a 100% step-up to fair value for all assets and liabilities, including the minority interest portion, and goodwill is recorded as if a 100% interest was acquired. SFAS 141(R) is effective for Citigroup on January 1, 2009, and is applied prospectively. Noncontrolling Interests in Subsidiaries In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160), which establishes standards for the accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries (previously called minority interests) in consolidated financial statements and for the loss of control of subsidiaries. Upon adoption, SFAS 160 requires that the equity interest of noncontrolling shareholders, partners, or other equity holders in subsidiaries be presented as a separate item in stockholders equity, rather than as a liability. After the initial adoption, when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary must be measured at fair value at the date of deconsolidation. The gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary is measured using the fair value of the remaining investment, rather than the previous carrying amount of that retained investment. SFAS 160 is effective for Citigroup on January 1, 2009. Early application is not allowed. As of January 1, 2009, $2.392 billion of noncontrolling interests will be reclassified from Other liabilities to Stockholders equity. Revisions to the Earnings per Share Calculation In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. Under the FSP, unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends will be considered to be a separate class of common stock and will be included in the basic EPS calculation using the two-class method. The FSP will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2009 and will require restatement of all prior periods presented. In August 2008, the FASB also issued a revised Exposure Draft of a proposed amendment to FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share. This proposed amendment seeks to simplify the method of calculating EPS, while promoting the international convergence of accounting standards. This proposed amendment reaffirms the requirements of FSP EITF 03-6-1 for basic EPS and also changes the calculation of diluted EPS. The Exposure Draft does not contain an effective date. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these changes. Fair Value Disclosures about Pension Plan Assets In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets. This FSP requires that information about plan assets be disclosed, on an annual basis, based on the fair value disclosure requirements of SFAS 157. Citigroup would be required to separate plan assets into the three fair value hierarchy levels and provide a rollforward of the changes in fair value of plan assets classified as Level 3. The disclosures about plan assets required by this FSP are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009, but would have no effect on the Consolidated Balance Sheet or Statement of Income. Additional Disclosures for Derivative Instruments In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment to SFAS 133 (SFAS 161). The standard requires enhanced disclosures about derivative instruments and hedged items that are accounted for under SFAS 133 and related interpretations. The standard will be effective for all of the Companys interim and annual financial statements beginning with the first quarter of 2009. The standard expands the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedged items and has no impact on how Citigroup accounts for these instruments. Loss-Contingency Disclosures In June 2008, the FASB issued an exposure draft proposing expanded disclosures regarding loss contingencies accounted for under FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and SFAS 141(R). This proposal increases the number of loss contingencies subject to disclosure and requires substantial quantitative and qualitative information to be provided about those loss contingencies. The proposed effective date is December 31, 2009. Elimination of QSPEs and Changes in the FIN 46(R) Consolidation Model The FASB has issued an exposure draft of a proposed standard that would eliminate Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs) from the guidance in SFAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. While the proposed standard has not been finalized, if it is issued in its current form, this change may have a significant impact on Citigroups consolidated financial statements as the Company may lose sales treatment for certain assets previously sold to a QSPE, as well as for certain future sales, and for certain transfers of portions 132 Table of Contents of assets that do not meet the proposed definition of participating interests. This proposed revision could become effective in January 2010 and should this occur these QSPEs will then become subject to review under FIN 46(R). As of December 31, 2008, the total assets of QSPEs to which Citigroup, acting as principal, has transferred assets and received sales treatment were approximately $822.1 billion. In connection with the proposed changes to SFAS 140, the FASB has also issued a separate exposure draft of a proposed standard that details three key changes to the consolidation model in FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities [FIN 46(R)]. First, the Board will now include former QSPEs in the scope of FIN 46(R). In addition, the FASB supports amending FIN 46(R) to change the method of analyzing which party to a variable interest entity (VIE) should consolidate the VIE (the primary beneficiary) to that of a qualitative determination of power combined with benefits and losses instead of the current risks and rewards model. Finally, the proposed standard requires that the analysis of primary beneficiaries be reevaluated whenever circumstances change. The existing rules require reconsideration only when specified reconsideration events occur. As of December 31, 2008, the total assets of significant unconsolidated VIEs with which Citigroup is involved were approximately $288.0 billion. FASB is currently redeliberating these proposed standards; therefore, they are still subject to change. Since QSPEs will likely be eliminated from SFAS 140 and thus become subject to FIN 46(R) consolidation guidance and since FIN 46(R)s method of determining which party must consolidate a VIE will likely change, we expect to consolidate only certain of the VIEs and QSPEs, with which Citigroup is involved. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these changes on Citigroups Consolidated Financial Statements. Investment Company Audit Guide (SOP 07-1) In July 2007, the AICPA issued Statement of Position 07-1, Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies and Equity Method Investors for Investments in Investment Companies (SOP 07-1), which was expected to be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2007. However, in February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date indefinitely by issuing an FSP SOP 07-1-1, Effective Date of AICPA Statement of Position 07-1. SOP 07-1 sets forth more stringent criteria for qualifying as an investment company than does the predecessor Audit Guide. In addition, SOP 07-1 establishes new criteria for a parent company or equity method investor to retain investment company accounting in their consolidated financial statements. Investment companies record all their investments at fair value with changes in value reflected in earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting SOP 07-1. Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entitys Own Stock Derivative contracts on a companys own stock may be accounted for as equity instruments, rather than as assets and liabilities, only if they are both indexed solely to the companys stock and settleable in shares. In June 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on Issue 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entitys Own Stock (Issue 07-5). Under Issue 07-5, an instrument (or embedded feature) would not be considered indexed to an entitys own stock if its settlement amount is affected by variables other than those used to determine the fair value of a plain vanilla option or forward contract on equity shares, or if the instrument contains a feature (such as a leverage factor) that increases exposure to those variables. An equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) would not be considered indexed to the entitys own stock if the strike price is denominated in a currency other than the issuers functional currency. Issue 07-5 is effective for Citigroup on January 1, 2009, and is not expected to have a material impact. Transition Guidance for Conforming Changes to Issue No. 98-5 In June 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on Issue 08-4, Transition Guidance for Conforming Changes to Issue No. 98-5 (Issue 08-4). Because of Issue 00-27, Application of Issue No. 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments, and SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, conforming changes were made to Issue 98-5, Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios. Issue 08-4 provides transition guidance for those conforming changes and is effective for Citigroups financial statements issued after January 1, 2009. Issue 08-4 is not expected to have a material impact. Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations In November 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on Issue 08-6, Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations (Issue 08-6). Under Issue 08-6, an entity shall measure its equity method investment initially at cost in accordance with SFAS 141(R). Any other-than-temporary impairment of an equity method investment should be recognized in accordance with Opinion 18. An equity method investor shall not separately test an investees underlying assets for impairment. Share issuance by an investee shall be accounted for as if the equity method investor had sold a proportionate share of its investment, with gain or loss recognized in earnings. Issue 08-6 is effective for Citigroup on January 1, 2009, and is not expected to have a material impact. Accounting for Defensive Intangible Assets In November 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on Issue 08-7, Accounting for Defensive Intangible Assets (Issue 08-7). According to Issue 08-7, an acquired defensive asset shall be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting (i.e., an asset separate from other assets of the acquirer). The useful life assigned to an acquired defensive asset shall be based on the period during which the asset would diminish in value. Issue 08-7 states that it would be rare for a defensive intangible asset to have an indefinite life. Issue 08-7 is effective for Citigroup on January 1, 2009, and is not expected to have a material impact. 133 Table of Contents 2.

INCENTIVE PLANS The Company has adopted a number of equity compensation plans under which it administers stock options, restricted or deferred stock and stock purchase programs. The award programs are used to attract, retain and motivate officers, employees and non-employee directors, to compensate them for their contributions to the Company, and to encourage employee stock ownership. The plans are administered by the Personnel and Compensation Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors, which is composed entirely of independent non-employee directors. At December 31, 2008, approximately 142 million shares were authorized and available for grant under Citigroups stock incentive and stock purchase plans. In accordance with Citigroup practice, shares would be issued out of Treasury stock upon exercise or vesting. The following table shows components of compensation expense relating to the Companys stock-based compensation programs as recorded during 2008, 2007 and 2006: In millions of dollars 2008 2007 2006 SFAS 123(R) charges for January 2006 awards to retirement-eligible employees $  $  $ 648 SFAS 123(R) charges for estimated awards to retirement-eligible employees 110 467 824 Option expense 29 86 129 Amortization of MC LTIP awards (1) 18 18  Amortization of restricted and deferred stock awards (excluding MC LTIP) (2) 3,133 2,728 1,565 Total $ 3,290 $ 3,299 $ 3,166 (1) Management Committee Long-Term Incentive Plan (MC LTIP) was created in 2007. (2) Represents amortization of expense over the remaining life of all unvested restricted and deferred stock awards granted to all employees prior to 2006. The 2008, 2007 and 2006 periods also include amortization expense for all unvested awards to non-retirement-eligible employees on or after January 1, 2006. Amortization includes estimated forfeitures of awards. STOCK AWARD PROGRAMS The Company, primarily through its Capital Accumulation Program (CAP), issues shares of Citigroup common stock in the form of restricted or deferred stock to participating officers and employees. For all stock award programs, during the applicable vesting period, the shares awarded cannot be sold or transferred by the participant, and some or all of the shares awarded are subject to cancellation if the participants employment is terminated. After the award vests, the shares become freely transferable (subject to the stock ownership commitment of senior executives). From the date of the award, the recipient of a restricted stock award can direct the vote of the shares and receive dividend equivalents. Recipients of deferred stock awards receive dividend equivalents, but cannot vote shares until they have vested. Stock awards granted in January 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 generally vest 25% per year over four years, except for awards to certain employees at Smith Barney that vest after two years and July 2007 Management Committee Long-Term Incentive Plan awards (further described below) that vest in January 2010. Stock awards granted in 2003 and 2004 generally vested after a two- or three-year vesting period. CAP participants in 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 could elect to receive all or part of their award in stock options. The figures presented in the stock option program tables include options granted under CAP. Unearned compensation expense associated with the stock awards represents the market value of Citigroup common stock at the date of grant and is recognized as a charge to income ratably over the full vesting period, except for those awards granted to retirement-eligible 140 Table of Contents employees. As explained below, pursuant to SFAS 123(R), the charge to income for awards made to retirement-eligible employees is accelerated based on the dates the retirement rules are met. CAP and certain other awards provide that participants who meet certain age and years of service conditions may continue to vest in all or a portion of the award without remaining employed by the Company during the entire vesting period, so long as they do not compete with Citigroup during that time. Beginning in 2006, awards to these retirement-eligible employees are recognized in the year prior to the grant in the same manner as cash incentive compensation is accrued. However, awards granted in January 2006 were required to be expensed in their entirety at the date of grant. Prior to 2006, all awards were recognized ratably over the stated vesting period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 121 for the impact of adopting SFAS 123(R). From 2003 to 2007, Citigroup granted restricted or deferred shares annually under the Citigroup Ownership Program (COP) to eligible employees. This program replaced the WealthBuilder, CitiBuilder and Citigroup Ownership stock option programs. Under COP, eligible employees received either restricted or deferred shares of Citigroup common stock that vest after three years. The last award under this program was in 2007. Unearned compensation expense associated with the stock grants represents the market value of Citigroup common stock at the date of grant and is recognized as a charge to income ratably over the vesting period, except for those awards granted to retirement-eligible employees. The charge to income for awards made to retirement-eligible employees is accelerated based on the dates the retirement rules are met. On July 17, 2007, the Personnel and Compensation Committee of Citigroups Board of Directors approved the Management Committee Long-Term Incentive Plan (MC LTIP), under the terms of the shareholder-approved 1999 Stock Incentive Plan. The MC LTIP provides members of the Citigroup Management Committee, including the CEO, CFO and the named executive officers in the Citigroup Proxy Statement, an opportunity to earn stock awards based on Citigroups performance. Each participant received an equity award that will be earned based on Citigroups performance for the period from July 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009. Three periods will be measured for performance (July 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007, full year 2008 and full year 2009). The ultimate value of the award will be based on Citigroups performance in each of these periods with respect to (1) total shareholder return versus Citigroups current key competitors and (2) publicly stated return on equity (ROE) targets measured at the end of each calendar year. If, in any of the three performance periods, Citigroups total shareholder return does not exceed the median performance of the peer group, the participants will not receive award shares for that period. The awards will generally vest after 30 months. In order to receive the shares, a participant generally must be a Citigroup employee on January 5, 2010. The final expense for each of the three calendar years will be adjusted based on the results of the ROE tests. No awards were earned for 2008 or 2007 because performance targets were not met. No new awards were made under the MC LTIP since the initial award in July 2007. On January 22, 2008, special retention stock awards were made to key senior executive officers and certain other members of senior management. The awards vest ratably over two- or four-year periods. Executives must remain employed through the vesting dates to receive the shares awarded, except in cases of death, disability, or involuntary termination other than for gross misconduct. Unlike CAP, post-employment vesting is not provided for participants who meet specified age and years of service conditions. Shares subject to some of the awards are exempted from the stock ownership commitment. A summary of the status of Citigroups unvested stock awards as of December 31, 2008, and changes during the 12 months ended December 31, 2008, is presented below: Unvested stock awards Shares Weighted averagegrant date fair value Unvested at January 1, 2008 153,207,132 $ 50.70 Awards 149,140,314 $ 26.04 Cancellations (20,945,018 ) $ 42.92 Deletions (1,968,824 ) $ 25.94 Vestings (1) (53,222,745 ) $ 47.06 Unvested at December 31, 2008 226,210,859 $ 36.23 (1) The weighted average market value of the vestings during 2008 was approximately $22.31 per share. As of December 31, 2008, there was $3.3 billion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock awards net of the forfeiture provision. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years. 141 Table of Contents Stock Option Programs The Company has a number of stock option programs for its non-employee directors, officers and employees. Generally, in 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005, stock options were granted only to CAP participants who elected to receive stock options in lieu of restricted or deferred stock awards, and to non-employee directors who elected to receive their compensation in the form of a stock option grant. Occasionally, stock options also may be granted as sign-on awards. All stock options are granted on Citigroup common stock with exercise prices that are no less than the fair market value at the time of grant. Generally, options granted from 2003 through 2008 have six-year terms, but there have been grants with terms of up to 10 years. Options granted from January 2003 through 2008 typically vest ratably over three- or four-year periods; however, directors options cliff vest after two years, and vesting schedules for sign-on grants may vary. Options granted in 2004 and 2003 typically vest in thirds each year over three years (with the first vesting date occurring 17 months after the grant date), and had 10-year terms. The sale of shares acquired through the exercise of employee stock options granted since January 2003 is restricted for a two-year period (and may be subject to the stock ownership commitment of senior executives thereafter). Prior to 2003, Citigroup options, including options granted since the date of the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group, Inc., generally vested at a rate of 20% per year over five years (with the first vesting date occurring 12 to 18 months following the grant date) and had 10-year terms. Certain options, mostly granted prior to January 1, 2003, permit an employee exercising an option under certain conditions to be granted new options (reload options) in an amount equal to the number of common shares used to satisfy the exercise price and the withholding taxes due upon exercise. The reload options are granted for the remaining term of the related original option and vest after six months. Reload options may in turn be exercised using the reload method, given certain conditions. An option may not be exercised using the reload method unless the market price on the date of exercise is at least 20% greater than the option exercise price. To further encourage employee stock ownership, the Companys eligible employees participated in WealthBuilder, CitiBuilder, or the Citigroup Ownership Program. Options granted under the WealthBuilder and the Citigroup Ownership programs vest over a five-year period, and options granted under the CitiBuilder program vest after five years. These options did not have a reload feature. Options have not been granted under these programs since 2002. On January 22, 2008, Vikram Pandit, CEO, was awarded stock options to purchase three million shares of common stock. The options vest 25% per year beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. One-third of the options have an exercise price equal to the NYSE closing price of Citigroup stock on the grant date ($24.40), one-third have an exercise price equal to a 25% premium over the grant date closing price ($30.50), and one-third have an exercise price equal to a 50% premium over the grant date closing price ($36.60). The first installment of these options vested on January 22, 2009. These options do not have a reload feature. Information with respect to stock option activity under Citigroup stock option plans for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Options Weightedaverageexerciseprice Intrinsic valueper share Options Weightedaverageexerciseprice Intrinsicvalueper share Options Weightedaverageexerciseprice Intrinsic valueper share Outstanding, beginning of period 172,767,122 $ 43.08 $  212,067,917 $ 41.87 $ 13.83 277,255,935 $ 40.27 $ 8.26 Grantedoriginal 18,140,448 $ 24.70  2,178,136 $ 54.21  3,259,547 $ 48.87  Grantedreload 15,984 $ 28.05  3,093,370 $ 52.66  12,530,318 $ 52.30  Forfeited or exchanged (24,080,659 ) $ 42.19  (8,796,402 ) $ 46.26 1.52 (14,123,110 ) $ 45.57 3.36 Expired (20,441,584 ) $ 38.88  (843,256 ) $ 43.40 4.38 (2,021,955 ) $ 44.87 4.06 Exercised (2,540,654 ) $ 22.36  (34,932,643 ) $ 36.62 11.16 (64,832,818 ) $ 36.37 12.56 Outstanding, end of period 143,860,657 $ 41.84 $  172,767,122 $ 43.08 $  212,067,917 $ 41.87 $ 13.83 Exercisable at end of period 123,654,795 165,024,814 179,424,900 142 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the information about stock options outstanding under Citigroup stock option plans at December 31, 2008: Options outstanding Options exercisable Range of exercise prices Numberoutstanding Weighted averagecontractual liferemaining Weighted average exercise price Number exercisable Weighted averageexercise price $7.77$9.99 1,627 2.6 years $ 7.77 1,627 $ 7.77 $10.00$19.99 2,263,074 7.0 years $ 17.54 97,985 $ 14.27 $20.00$29.99 13,592,346 5.2 years $ 24.61 1,006,628 $ 25.48 $30.00$39.99 27,325,170 1.6 years $ 33.11 25,200,815 $ 33.07 $40.00$49.99 86,577,676 2.0 years $ 46.26 84,779,475 $ 46.22 $50.00$56.83 14,100,764 2.2 years $ 52.59 12,568,265 $ 52.38 143,860,657 2.3 years $ 41.84 123,654,795 $ 43.97 As of December 31, 2008, there was $45.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options; this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years. Fair Value Assumptions SFAS 123(R) requires that reload options be treated as separate grants from the related original grants. Pursuant to the terms of currently outstanding reloadable options, upon exercise of an option, if employees use previously owned shares to pay the exercise price and surrender shares otherwise to be received for related tax withholding, they will receive a reload option covering the same number of shares used for such purposes, but only if the market price on the date of exercise is at least 20% greater than the option exercise price. Reload options vest after six months and carry the same expiration date as the option that gave rise to the reload grant. The exercise price of a reload grant is the fair market value of Citigroup common stock on the date the underlying option is exercised. Reload options are intended to encourage employees to exercise options at an earlier date and to retain the shares acquired. The result of this program is that employees generally will exercise options as soon as they are able and, therefore, these options have shorter expected lives. Shorter option lives result in lower valuations. However, such values are expensed more quickly due to the shorter vesting period of reload options. In addition, since reload options are treated as separate grants, the existence of the reload feature results in a greater number of options being valued. Shares received through option exercises under the reload program, as well as certain other options, are subject to restrictions on sale. Additional valuation and related assumption information for Citigroup option plans is presented below. Citigroup uses a lattice-type model to value stock options.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Company has several non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. employees in 2008 and has various defined benefit pension and termination indemnity plans covering employees outside the United States. The U.S. qualified defined benefit plan provides benefits under a cash balance formula. However, employees satisfying certain age and service requirements remain covered by a prior final average pay formula under that plan. Effective January 1, 2008, the U.S. qualified pension plan was frozen. Accordingly, no additional compensation-based contributions were credited to the cash balance plan for existing plan participants. However, employees still covered under the prior final pay plan will continue to accrue benefits. The Company also offers postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible U.S. retired employees, as well as to certain eligible employees outside the United States. The following tables summarize the components of net (benefit) expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income and the funded status and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the Companys U.S. qualified pension plan, postretirement plans and plans outside the United States. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for the U.S. plans as well as the plans outside the United States.

Restructuring charges for the pension plans include $23 million for the U.S. plans and $22 million for the non-U.S. plans. Restructuring charges for the postretirement plans include $6 million for U.S. plans. In 2007, the Company recognized a net curtailment loss primarily resulting from accelerated vesting of benefits under reorganization actions outside the U.S. In 2006, the Company recognized a curtailment gain resulting from the January 1, 2008 freeze of the U.S. qualified pension plan. (3) The 2008 curtailment loss in the non-U.S pension plans includes $71 million reported under Discontinued operations reflecting the sale of Citigroups German retail banking operations to Credit Mutuel. The estimated net actuarial loss, prior service cost and net transition obligation that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net expense in 2009 are approximately $68 million, $2 million and $(1) million, respectively, for defined benefit pension plans. For postretirement plans, the estimated 2009 net actuarial loss and service cost are approximately $21 million and $(1) million, respectively. 144 Table of Contents Net Amount Recognized Pension plans Postretirement benefit plans U.S. plans (1) Non-U.S. plans U.S. plans Non-U.S. plans In millions of dollars 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 Change in projected benefit obligation Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 11,029 $ 11,109 $ 6,007 $ 5,363 $ 1,042 $ 1,101 $ 1,193 $ 825 Benefits earned during the year 23 301 201 202 1 1 36 27 Interest cost on benefit obligation 674 641 354 318 62 59 96 75 Plan amendments   2 12  3  Actuarial loss (gain) (167 ) (439 ) (625 ) (28 ) 1 (67 ) (79 ) 296 Benefits paid (607 ) (583 ) (282 ) (269 ) (72 ) (75 ) (41 ) (39 ) Expected Medicare Part D subsidy     11 11   Acquisitions (2)   206 156     Divestitures   (380 )      Settlements   (65 ) (21 )     Curtailments (3) 58  3 25 17 9 (2 )  Foreign exchange impact   (858 ) 249   (266 ) 9 Projected benefit obligation at year end $ 11,010 $ 11,029 $ 4,563 $ 6,007 1,062 $ 1,042 $ 937 $ 1,193 Change in plan assets Plan assets at fair value at beginning of year $ 12,840 $ 11,932 $ 6,629 $ 5,906 $ 191 $ 175 $ 1,008 $ 984 Actual return on plan assets (730 ) 1,476 (883 ) 432 (7 ) 22 (182 ) 66 Company contributions (4) 13 15 286 223 31 69 72 3 Employee contributions   6 8    Acquisitions (5)   165 90    Divestitures   (380 )     Settlements   (57 ) (21 )    Benefits paid (607 ) (583 ) (282 ) (269 ) (72 ) (75 ) (42 ) (39 ) Foreign exchange impact   (948 ) 260   (185 ) (6 ) Plan assets at fair value at year end $ 11,516 $ 12,840 $ 4,536 $ 6,629 $ 143 $ 191 $ 671 $ 1,008 Funded status of the plan at year end $ 506 $ 1,811 $ (27 ) $ 622 $ (919 ) $ (851 ) $ (266 ) $ (185 ) Net amount recognized Benefit asset $ 506 $ 1,811 $ 511 $ 1,061 $  $  $  $ 34 Benefit liability   (538 ) (439 ) (919 ) (851 ) (266 ) (219 ) Net amount recognized on the balance sheet $ 506 $ 1,811 $ (27 ) $ 622 $ (919 ) $ (851 ) $ (266 ) $ (185 ) Amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss): Net transition obligation $  $  $ (5 ) $ 8 $  $  $ 1 $ 2 Prior service cost (benefit) (4 ) (7 ) 29 30 (10 ) (11 ) (1 ) (1 ) Net actuarial loss 1,978 467 1,219 786 41 23 442 374 Net amount recognized in equitypretax 1,974 $ 460 $ 1,243 $ 824 $ 31 $ 12 $ 442 $ 375 Accumulated benefit obligation at year end $ 10,937 $ 10,960 $ 4,145 $ 5,403 $ 1,062 $ 1,042 $ 937 $ 1,193 (1) The U.S. plans exclude nonqualified pension plans, for which the aggregate projected benefit obligation was $586 million and $611 million and the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation was $580 million and $604 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These plans are unfunded. As such, the funded status of these plans is $(586) million and $(611) million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) reflects pretax charges of $72 million and $85 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, that primarily relate to net actuarial loss. (2) Acquisitions in the non-U.S pension plans include $29 million of projected benefit obligations from newly material plans. (3) Changes in projected benefit obligation due to curtailments in the non-U.S. pension plans in 2008 include $(9) million in curtailment gains and $12 million in special termination costs. (4) Company contributions to the U.S. pension plan include $13 million and $15 million during 2008 and 2007, respectively, relating to certain investment advisory fees and administrative costs that were absorbed by the Company. Company contributions to the non-U.S. pension plans include $55 million and $47 million of benefits directly paid by the Company during 2008 and 2007, respectively. (5) Acquisitions in the non-U.S pension plans include $10 million of plan assets from newly material plans. The following table shows the change in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: In millions of dollars 2008 2007 Change Other assets Prepaid benefit cost $ 1,017 $ 2,906 $ (1,889 ) Other liabilities Accrued benefit liability 2,309 2,120 189 Funded status $ (1,292 ) $ 786 $ (2,078 ) Deferred taxes, net 5,179 4,261 918 Amortization and other (259 ) Change in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (1) $ (1,419 ) (1) Primarily related to changes in net actuarial gain/loss of the Companys pension and postretirement plans. 145 Table of Contents At the end of 2008 and 2007, for both qualified and nonqualified plans and for both funded and unfunded plans, the aggregate projected benefit obligation (PBO), the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation (ABO), and the aggregate fair value of plan assets for pension plans with a projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets, and pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets, were as follows: PBO exceeds fair value of planassets ABO exceeds fair value of planassets U.S. plans Non-U.S. plans U.S. plans Non-U.S. plans In millions of dollars 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 Projected benefit obligation $ 586 $ 611 $ 1,866 $ 944 $ 586 $ 611 $ 1,374 $ 804 Accumulated benefit obligation 580 604 1,640 749 580 604 1,231 668 Fair value of plan assets   1,328 505   875 396 Combined plan assets for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, excluding U.S. nonqualified plans, exceeded the accumulated benefit obligations by $1.0 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. Assumptions The discount rate and future rate of compensation assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit expense for the Companys plans are shown in the following table: At year end 2008 2007 Discount rate U.S. plans (1) Pension 6.1 % 6.2 % Postretirement 6.0 6.0 Non-U.S. plans Range (2) 1.75 to 17.0 2.0 to 10.25 Weighted average 6.6 6.2 Future compensation increase rate U.S. plans (3) 3.0 3.0 Non-U.S. plans Range (2) 1.0 to 11.5 3.0 to 8.25 Weighted average 4.5 4.4 During the year 2008 2007 Discount rate U.S. plans (1) Pension 6.2 % 5.9 % Postretirement 6.0 5.7 Non-U.S. plans Range 2.0 to 10.25 2.25 to 11.0 Weighted average 6.2 6.5 Future compensation increase rate U.S. plans (3) 3.0 4.0 Non-U.S. plans Range (4) 1.0 to 8.25 1.0 to 10.0 Weighted average 4.4 4.3 (1) Weighted average rates for the U.S. plans equal the stated rates. (2) At December 31, 2008, the range includes plans in countries that were not reported earlier due to immateriality. Discount rates for the same group of countries as of December 31, 2007 were 2.0% to 13.0%. Future compensation increase rates for the same group of countries as of December 31, 2007 was 1.5% to 9.0%. (3) Effective January 1, 2008, the U.S. qualified pension plan was frozen. Only the future compensation increases for the grandfathered employees will affect future pension expense and obligations. Future compensation increase rates for small groups of employees were 4.0% or 6.0%. (4) Future compensation increase rate for the non-U.S plans differs from the year end 2007 rates due to inclusion of newly material plans in 2008. 146 Table of Contents A one-percentage-point change in the discount rates would have the following effects on pension expense: One-percentage- point increase One-percentage- point decrease In millions of dollars 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Effect on pension expense for U.S. plans (1) $ 36 $ 25 $ (100 ) $ (24 ) $ (5 ) $ 120 Effect on pension expense for non-U.S. plans (58 ) (59 ) (52 ) 94 80 72 (1) Due to the freeze of the U.S. qualified pension plan commencing January 1, 2008, the majority of the prospective service cost has been eliminated and the gain/loss amortization period was changed to the life expectancy for inactive participants. As a result, pension expense for the U.S. qualified pension plan is driven more by interest costs than service costs, and an increase in the discount rate would increase pension expense, while a decrease in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows: 2008 2007 Health care cost increase rateU.S. plans Following year 7.5 % 8.0 % Ultimate rate to which cost increase is assumed to decline 5.0 % 5.0 % Year in which the ultimate rate is reached 2014 2014 A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: One-percentage- point increase One-percentage- point decrease In millions of dollars 2008 2007 2008 2007 Effect on benefits earned and interest cost for U.S. plans $ 3 $ 3 $ (2 ) $ (3 ) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for U.S. plans 47 50 (41 ) (44 ) Citigroup considers the expected rate of return to be a longer-term assessment of return expectations, based on each plans expected asset allocation, and does not anticipate changing this assumption annually unless there are significant changes in economic conditions or portfolio composition. Market performance over a number of earlier years is evaluated covering a wide range of economic conditions to determine whether there are sound reasons for projecting forward any past trends. The expected long-term rates of return on assets used in determining the Companys pension expense are shown below: 2008 2007 Rate of return on assets U.S. plans (1) 8.0 % 8.0 % Non-U.S. plans Range 3.14 to 12.5 % 3.25 to 12.5 % Weighted average 7.62 % 8.0 % (1) Weighted average rates for the U.S. plans equal the stated rates. As of December 31, 2008, the Company lowered its expected rate of return to 7.75%. A one-percentage-point change in the expected rates of return would have the following effects on pension expense: One-percentage- point increase One-percentage- point decrease In millions of dollars 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Effect on pension expense for U.S. plans $ (118 ) $ (118 ) $ (110 ) $ 118 $ 118 $ 110 Effect on pension expense for non-U.S. plans (66 ) (59 ) (61 ) 66 59 61 147 Table of Contents Plan Assets Citigroups pension and postretirement plans asset allocations for the U.S. plans at the end of 2008 and 2007, and the target allocations for 2009 by asset category based on asset fair values, are as follows: Target assetallocation U.S. pension assets at December 31 U.S. postretirement assets at December 31 Asset category 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 Equity securities (1) 3 to 38 % 6 % 27 % 6 % 27 % Debt securities 25 to 62 42 17 42 17 Real estate 3 to 8 6 6 6 6 Private equity 0 to 15 17 15 17 15 Other investments 12 to 32 29 35 29 35 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Equity securities in the U.S. pension plans include no Citigroup common stock at the end of 2008. In January 2007, the U.S. pension plans sold all the Citigroup common stock it held (approximately $137.2 million) to the Company at its fair value. Third-party investment managers and affiliated advisors provide their respective services to Citigroups U.S. pension plans. Assets are rebalanced as the plan investment committee deems appropriate. Citigroups investment strategy with respect to its pension assets is to maintain a globally diversified investment portfolio across several asset classes targeting an annual rate of return of 7.75% that, when combined with Citigroups contributions to the plans, will maintain the plans ability to meet all required benefit obligations. Citigroups pension and postretirement plans weighted average asset allocations for the non-U.S. plans and the actual ranges at the end of 2008 and 2007, and the weighted average target allocations for 2009 by asset category based on asset fair values, are as follows: Non-U.S. pension plans Weightedaverage Actual range Weighted average Target assetallocation at December 31 at December 31 Asset category 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 Equity securities 37.61 % 0.0 to 56.8 % 0.0 to 75.1 % 34.4 % 56.2 % Debt securities 53.95 0.0 to 85.5 0.0 to 100 55.4 37.8 Real estate 0.75 0.0 to 40.1 0.0 to 35.9 0.6 0.5 Other investments 7.69 0.0 to 100 0.0 to 100 9.6 5.5 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Non-U.S. postretirement plans Weightedaverage Actual range Weighted average Target assetallocation at December 31 at December 31 Asset category 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 Equity securities 39.34 % 0.0 to 53.18 % 0.0 to 58.4 % 52.26 % 57.4 % Debt securities 36.13 36.11 to 100 41.6 to 100 37.21 42.6 Real estate      Other investments 24.53 0.0 to 10.71  10.53  Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Citigroups global pension and postretirement funds investment strategies are to invest in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants. The investment strategies are targeted to produce a total return that, when combined with Citigroups contributions to the funds, will maintain the funds ability to meet all required benefit obligations. Risk is controlled through diversification of asset types and investments in domestic and international equities, fixed income securities and cash. The target asset allocation in most locations outside the U.S. is to have the majority of the assets in either equity or debt securities. These allocations may vary by geographic region and country depending on the nature of applicable obligations and various other regional considerations. The wide variation in the actual range of plan asset allocations for the funded non-U.S. plans is a result of differing local statutory requirements and economic conditions. For example, in certain countries local law requires that all pension plan assets must be invested in fixed income investments, government funds, or local country securities. 148 Table of Contents Contributions Citigroups pension funding policy for U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans is generally to fund to applicable minimum funding requirements rather than to the amounts of accumulated benefit obligations. For the U.S. plans, the Company may increase its contributions above the minimum required contribution under ERISA, if appropriate to its tax and cash position and the plans funded position. For the U.S. pension plans, at December 31, 2008, there were no minimum required cash contributions and no discretionary or non-cash contributions are currently planned. For the non-U.S. pension plans, discretionary cash contributions in 2009 are anticipated to be approximately $167 million. In addition, the Company expects to contribute $27 million of benefits to be directly paid by the Company for its unfunded non-U.S. pension and postretirement plans. For the U.S. postretirement benefit plans, there are no expected or required contributions for 2009. For the non-U.S. postretirement benefit plans, expected cash contributions for 2009 are $91 million including $3 million of benefits to be directly paid by the Company. These estimates are subject to change, since contribution decisions are affected by various factors, such as market performance and regulatory requirements; in addition, management has the ability to change funding policy. Estimated Future Benefit Payments The Company expects to pay the following estimated benefit payments in future years: U.S. plans Non-U.S. plans In millions of dollars Pensionbenefits Pensionbenefits Postretirementbenefits 2009 $ 740 $ 276 $ 37 2010 745 258 39 2011 752 275 41 2012 769 284 44 2013 789 288 47 20142018 4,148 1,680 291 Prescription Drugs In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act of 2003) was enacted. The Act of 2003 established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare known as Medicare Part D, and a federal subsidy to sponsors of U.S. retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The benefits provided to certain participants are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D and, accordingly, the Company is entitled to a subsidy. The expected subsidy reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) by approximately $142 million and $141 million as of January 1, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and the 2008 and 2007 postretirement expense by approximately $17 million and $18 million, respectively, for all of the U.S. postretirement welfare plans for 2008 and 2007. The following table shows the estimated future benefit payments without the effect of the subsidy and the amounts of the expected subsidy in future years: Expected U.S. postretirement benefit payments In millions of dollars Before MedicarePart D subsidy MedicarePart D subsidy 2009 $ 105 $ 11 2010 107 12 2011 107 12 2012 107 13 2013 105 13 20142018 490 68 Citigroup 401(k) Under the Citigroup 401(k) plan, a defined contribution plan, eligible U.S. employees receive matching contributions up to 6% of their compensation, subject to statutory limits. The matching contribution is invested according to participants individual elections. Additionally, for eligible employees whose compensation is $100,000 or less, a fixed contribution of up to 2% of compensation is provided. This fixed contribution is invested initially in the Citigroup common stock fund. Employees are free to transfer to alternative plan investments immediately. The pretax expense associated with this plan amounted to approximately $580 million in 2008, $81 million in 2007, and $77 million in 2006. The increase in expense from 2007 to 2008 reflects the redesign of retirement programs effective January 1, 2008. The redesign provides for a significantly enhanced 401(k) company contribution offset by the elimination of future accruals under the Citigroup U.S. Pension Plan. 149 Table of Contents 10. RESTRUCTURING In the fourth quarter of 2008, Citigroup recorded a pretax restructuring expense of $1.797 billion pre-tax related to the implementation of a Company-wide re-engineering plan. This initiative will generate headcount reductions of approximately 20,600. The charges related to the 2008 Re-engineering Projects Restructuring Initiative are reported in the Restructuring line on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income and are recorded in each segment. In 2007, the Company completed a review of its structural expense base in a Company-wide effort to create a more streamlined organization, reduce expense growth, and provide investment funds for future growth initiatives. As a result of this review, a pretax restructuring charge of $1.4 billion was recorded in Corporate/Other during the first quarter of 2007. Additional net charges of $151 million were recognized in subsequent quarters throughout 2007 and a net release of $31 million in 2008 due to a change in estimates. The charges related to the 2007 Structural Expense Review Restructuring Initiative are reported in the Restructuring line on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income. The primary goals of the 2007 Structural Expense Review and Restructuring, and the 2008 Re-engineering Projects and Restructuring Initiatives were:  eliminate layers of management/improve workforce management;  consolidate certain back-office, middle-office and corporate functions;  increase the use of shared services;  expand centralized procurement; and  continue to rationalize operational spending on technology. The implementation of these restructuring initiatives also caused certain related premises and equipment assets to become redundant. The remaining depreciable lives of these assets were shortened, and accelerated depreciation charges began in the second quarter of 2007 and fourth quarter of 2008 for the 2007 and 2008 initiatives, respectively, in addition to normal scheduled depreciation. The following tables detail the Companys restructuring reserves. 2008 Re-engineering Projects Restructuring Charges Severance In millions of dollars SFAS 112 (1) SFAS 146 (2) Contract termination costs Asset write- downs (3) Employee termination cost Total Citigroup (4) Total Citigroup (pretax) Original restructuring charge $1,254 $295 $55 $ 123 $19 $ 1,746 Utilization (114 ) (3 ) (2 ) (100 )  (219 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 $1,140 $292 $53 $ 23 $19 $ 1,527 2007 Structural Expense Review Restructuring Charges Severance In millions of dollars SFAS 112 (1) SFAS 146 (2) Contract termination costs Asset write- downs (3) Employee termination cost Total Citigroup Total Citigroup (pretax) Original restructuring charge $ 950 $ 11 $ 25 $ 352 $ 39 $ 1,377 Additional charge $ 42 $ 96 $ 29 $ 27 $ 11 $ 205 Foreign exchange 19  2   21 Utilization (547 ) (75 ) (28 ) (363 ) (33 ) (1,046 ) Changes in estimates (39 )  (6 ) (1 ) (8 ) (54 ) Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 425 $ 32 $ 22 $ 15 $ 9 $ 503 Additional charge $ 10 $ 14 $ 43 $ 6 $  $ 73 Foreign exchange (11 )  (4 )   (15 ) Utilization (288 ) (34 ) (22 ) (7 ) (6 ) (357 ) Changes in estimates (93 ) (2 ) (2 ) (4 ) (3 ) (104 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 43 $ 10 $ 37 $ 10 $  $ 100 (1) Accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 112, Employers Accounting for Post Employment Benefits (SFAS 112).

The reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the Companys effective income tax rate applicable to income from continuing operations (before minority interest and the cumulative effect of accounting changes) for the years ended December 31 was as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Federal statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 2.6 (58.6 ) 1.6 Foreign income tax rate differential 1.2 (180.8 ) (4.3 ) Audit settlements (1)   (2.9 ) Goodwill (2.2 ) 0.5  Tax advantaged investments 1.7 (84.0 ) (1.8 ) Other, net 0.6 (34.0 ) (0.4 ) Effective income tax rate (2) 38.9 % (321.9 )% 27.2 % (1) For 2006, relates to the resolution of the Federal and New York tax audits. (2) The Company recorded an income tax benefit for 2007. The effective tax rate (benefit) of (322)% primarily resulted from pretax losses in the Companys ICG and N.A. and Consumer Banking businesses (the U.S. is a higher tax rate jurisdiction). In addition, the tax benefits of permanent differences, including the tax benefit for not providing U.S. income taxes on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely invested, favorably impacted the Companys effective tax rate.

The remainder of the uncertain tax positions have offsetting amounts in other jurisdictions or are temporary differences. Interest and penalties (not included in the unrecognized tax benefits above) are a component of the Provision for income taxes.

It is thus reasonably possible that significant changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months, but the Company does not expect such audits to result in amounts that would cause a significant change to its effective tax rate, other than the following items. The Company is currently at IRS Appeals for the years 19992002. One of the issues relates to the timing of the inclusion of interchange fees received by the Company relating to credit card purchases by its cardholders. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months the Company can either reach agreement on this issue at Appeals or decide to litigate the issue. This issue is presently being litigated by another company in a United States Tax Court case. The gross uncertain tax position for this item at December 31, 2008 is $542 million. Since this is a temporary difference, the only effect to the Companys effective tax rate would be due to net interest and state tax rate differentials. If the reserve were to be released, the tax benefit could be as much as $168 million. In addition, the Company expects to conclude the IRS audit of its U.S. federal consolidated income tax returns for the years 20032005 within the next 12 months. The gross uncertain tax position at December 31, 2008 for the items expected to be resolved is approximately $350 million plus gross interest of $70 million. The potential net tax benefit to continuing operations could be approximately $325 million. The following are the major tax jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate and the earliest tax year subject to examination: Jurisdiction Tax year United States 2003 Mexico 2006 New York State and City 2005 United Kingdom 2007 Germany 2000 Korea 2005 Japan 2006 Brazil 2004 Foreign pretax earnings approximated $10.3 billion in 2008, $9.1 billion in 2007, and $13.6 billion in 2006 ($5.1 billion, $0.7 billion and $0.9 billion of which, respectively, are in discontinued operations). As a U.S. corporation, Citigroup and its U.S. subsidiaries are subject to U.S. taxation currently on all foreign pretax earnings earned by a foreign branch. Pretax earnings of a foreign subsidiary or affiliate are subject to U.S. taxation when effectively repatriated. The Company provides income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries except to the extent that such earnings are indefinitely invested outside the United States. At December 31, 2008, $22.8 billion of accumulated undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries were indefinitely invested. At the existing U.S. federal income tax rate, additional taxes (net of U.S. foreign tax credits) of $6.1 billion would have to be provided if such earnings were remitted currently. The current years effect on the income tax expense from continuing operations is included in the Foreign income tax rate differential line in the reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the Companys effective income tax rate on the previous page. Income taxes are not provided for on the Companys savings bank base year bad debt reserves that arose before 1988 because under current U.S. tax rules such taxes will become payable only to the extent such amounts are distributed in excess of limits prescribed by federal law. At December 31, 2008, the amount of the base year reserves totaled approximately $358 million (subject to a tax of $125 million). The Company has no valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, the Company had a U.S. foreign tax-credit carryforward of $10.5 billion, $0.4 billion whose expiry date is 2016, $5.3 billion whose expiry date is 2017 and $4.8 billion whose expiry date is 2018. The Company has a U.S federal consolidated net operating loss (NOL) carryforward of approximately $13 billion whose expiration date is 2028. The Company also has a general business credit carryforward of $0.6 billion whose expiration dates are 2027-2028. The Company has state and local net operating loss carryforwards of $16.2 billion and $4.9 billion in New York State and New York City, respectively. This consists of $2.4 billion and $1.2 billion, whose expiration date is 2027 and $13.8 billion and $3.7 billion whose expiration date is 2028 and for which the Company has recorded a deferred-tax asset of $1.2 billion, along with less significant net operating losses in various other states for which the Company has recorded a deferred-tax asset of $399 million and which expire between 2012 and 2028. In addition, the Company has recorded deferred-tax assets in APB 23 subsidiaries for foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $130 million (which expires in 2018) and $101 million (with no expiration). Although realization is not assured, the Company believes that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset of $44.5 billion is more likely than not based on expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which it operates and available tax planning strategies, as defined in SFAS 109, that could be implemented if necessary to prevent a carryforward from expiring. The Companys net deferred tax asset (DTA) of $44.5 billion consists of approximately $36.5 billion of net U.S. federal DTAs, $4 billion of net state DTAs and $4 billion of net foreign DTAs. Included in the net federal DTA of $36.5 billion are deferred tax liabilities of $4 billion that will reverse in the relevant carryforward period and may be used to support the DTA. The major components of the U.S. federal DTA are $10.5 billion in foreign tax-credit carryforwards, $4.6 billion in a net-operating-loss carryforward, $0.6 billion in a general-business-credit carryforward, $19.9 billion in net deductions that have not yet been taken on a tax return, and $0.9 billion in compensation deductions, which reduced Additional paid-in capital in January 2009 and for which SFAS 123(R) did not permit any adjustment to such DTA at December 31, 2008 because the related stock compensation was not yet deductible to the Company. In general, Citigroup would need to generate approximately $85 billion of taxable income during the respective carryforward periods to fully realize its federal, state and local DTAs. 153 Table of Contents As a result of the losses incurred in 2008, the Company is in a three-year cumulative pretax loss position at December 31, 2008. A cumulative loss position is considered significant negative evidence in assessing the realizability of a DTA. The Company has concluded that there is sufficient positive evidence to overcome this negative evidence. The positive evidence includes two means by which the Company is able to fully realize its DTA. First, the Company forecasts sufficient taxable income in the carryforward period, exclusive of tax planning strategies, even under stressed scenarios. Secondly, the Company has sufficient tax planning strategies, including potential sales of businesses and assets that could realize the excess of appreciated value over the tax basis of its assets, in an amount sufficient to fully realize its DTA. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be significantly reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are significantly lower than forecasted due to further decreases in market conditions. Based upon the foregoing discussion, as well as tax planning opportunities and other factors discussed below, the U.S. and New York State and City net operating loss carryforward period of 20 years provides enough time to utilize the DTAs pertaining to the existing net operating loss carryforwards and any NOL that would be created by the reversal of the future net deductions which have not yet been taken on a tax return. The U.S. foreign tax-credit carryforward period is 10 years. In addition, utilization of foreign tax credits is restricted to 35% of foreign source taxable income in that year. Due to the passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, overall domestic losses that the Company has incurred of approximately $35 billion are allowed to be reclassified as foreign source income to the extent of 50% of domestic source income produced in subsequent years and are in fact sufficient to cover the foreign tax credits being carried forward. As such, the foreign source taxable income limitation will not be an impediment to the foreign tax credit carryforward usage as long as the Company can generate sufficient domestic taxable income within the 10-year carryforward period. Regarding the estimate of future taxable income, the Company has projected its pretax earnings based upon the core businesses that the Company intends to conduct going forward, as well as Smith Barney and Primerica Financial Services. These businesses have produced steady and strong earnings in the past. The Company has taken steps to ring-fence certain legacy assets to minimize any losses from the legacy assets going forward. During 2008, the core businesses have been negatively affected by the large increase in consumer credit losses during this sharp economic downturn cycle. The Company has already taken steps to reduce its cost structure. In addition, its funding structure has been changed by the issuance of preferred stock, which is funded by non-tax deductible dividends, as opposed to debt type securities, which are funded by tax deductible interest payments. Taking these items into account, the Company is projecting that it will generate sufficient pretax earnings within the 10-year carryforward period alluded to above to be able to fully utilize the foreign tax credit carryforward, in addition to any foreign tax credits produced in such period. The Company has also examined tax planning strategies available to it in accordance with SFAS 109 which would be employed, if necessary, to prevent a carryforward from expiring. These strategies include repatriating low taxed foreign earnings for which an APB 23 assertion has not been made, accelerating taxable income into or deferring deductions out of the latter years of the carryforward period with reversals to occur after the carryforward period (e.g., selling appreciated intangible assets and electing straight-line depreciation), holding on to AFS debt securities with losses until they mature, and selling certain assets which produce tax exempt income, while purchasing assets which produce fully taxable income. In addition, the sale or restructuring of certain businesses, such as the announced Smith Barney joint venture with Morgan Stanley with an estimated pretax gain of $9.5 billion, can produce significant taxable income within the relevant carryforward periods. 154 Table of Contents 12.

Adding back the effect of dilutive securities would result in anti-dilution. (2) Diluted shares used in the diluted EPS calculation represent basic shares for 2008 due to the net loss. Using actual diluted shares would result in anti-dilution. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, weighted average options of 156.1 million, 76.3 million, and 69.1 million shares, respectively, with weighted average exercise prices of $41.99, $50.40, and $49.98 per share, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because the options exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the Companys common stock. 155 Table of Contents 13. FEDERAL FUNDS, SECURITIES BORROWED, LOANED, AND SUBJECT TO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, at their respective fair values, consisted of the following at December 31: In millions of dollars at year end 2008 2007 Federal funds sold $  $ 196 Securities purchased under agreements to resell 78,701 98,258 Deposits paid for securities borrowed 105,432 175,612 Total $ 184,133 $ 274,066 Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, at their respective fair values, consisted of the following at December 31: In millions of dollars at year end 2008 2007 Federal funds purchased $ 5,755 $ 6,279 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 177,585 230,880 Deposits received for securities loaned 21,953 67,084 Total $ 205,293 $ 304,243 The resale and repurchase agreements represent collateralized financing transactions used to generate net interest income and facilitate trading activity. These instruments are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities and generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to a year. It is the Companys policy to take possession of the underlying collateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the agreements and, when necessary, require prompt transfer of additional collateral or reduction in the balance in order to maintain contractual margin protection. In the event of counterparty default, the financing agreement provides the Company with the right to liquidate the collateral held. As disclosed in Note 27 on page 200, effective January 1, 2007, the Company elected fair value option accounting in accordance with SFAS 159 for the majority of the resale and repurchase agreements. The remaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as specified in the respective agreements. Resale agreements and repurchase agreements are reported net by counterparty, when applicable, pursuant to FIN 41. Excluding the impact of FIN 41, resale agreements totaled $114.0 billion and $151.0 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. A majority of the deposits paid for securities borrowed and deposits received for securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received and are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities and corporate debt and equity securities. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the Company elected fair value option for certain securities borrowed and loaned portfolios in accordance with SFAS 159. This election was made effective in the second quarter of 2007. Securities borrowed transactions require the Company to deposit cash with the lender. With respect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value of securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and securities loaned daily, and additional collateral is obtained as necessary. Securities borrowed and securities loaned are reported net by counterparty, when applicable, pursuant to FIN 39. 156 Table of Contents 14. BROKERAGE RECEIVABLES AND BROKERAGE PAYABLES The Company has receivables and payables for financial instruments purchased from and sold to brokers, dealers and customers. The Company is exposed to risk of loss from the inability of brokers, dealers or customers to pay for purchases or to deliver the financial instruments sold, in which case the Company would have to sell or purchase the financial instruments at prevailing market prices. Credit risk is reduced to the extent that an exchange or clearing organization acts as a counterparty to the transaction. The Company seeks to protect itself from the risks associated with customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines. Margin levels are monitored daily, and customers deposit additional collateral as required. Where customers cannot meet collateral requirements, the Company will liquidate sufficient underlying financial instruments to bring the customer into compliance with the required margin level. Exposure to credit risk is impacted by market volatility, which may impair the ability of clients to satisfy their obligations to the Company. Credit limits are established and closely monitored for customers and brokers and dealers engaged in forwards, futures and other transactions deemed to be credit sensitive. Brokerage receivables and brokerage payables, which arise in the normal course of business, consisted of the following at December 31: In millions of dollars 2008 2007 Receivables from customers $ 26,297 $ 39,137 Receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations 17,981 18,222 Total brokerage receivables $ 44,278 $ 57,359 Payables to customers $ 54,167 $ 54,038 Payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations 16,749 30,913 Total brokerage payables $ 70,916 $ 84,951 15.

Securities Available-for-Sale The amortized cost and fair value of securities available-for-sale at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 were as follows: 2008 2007(1) In millions of dollars Amortized cost Gross unrealized gains Grossunrealized losses Fair value Amortized cost Gross unrealized gains Gross unrealized losses Fair value Debt securities available-for-sale: Mortgage-backed securities (2) $ 32,798 $ 266 $ 3,196 $ 29,868 $ 63,888 $ 158 $ 971 $ 63,075 U.S. Treasury and federal agencies 23,702 340 77 23,965 19,428 66 70 19,424 State and municipal 18,156 38 4,370 13,824 13,342 120 256 13,206 Foreign government 79,505 945 408 80,042 72,339 396 660 72,075 U.S. corporate 10,258 59 590 9,727 9,648 70 120 9,598 Other debt securities 12,172 42 314 11,900 12,336 97 464 11,969 Total debt securities available-for-sale $ 176,591 $ 1,690 $ 8,955 $ 169,326 $ 190,981 $ 907 $ 2,541 $ 189,347 Marketable equity securities available-for-sale $ 5,768 $ 554 $ 459 $ 5,863 $ 1,404 $ 2,420 $ 58 $ 3,766 Total securities available-for-sale $ 182,359 $ 2,244 $ 9,414 $ 175,189 $ 192,385 $ 3,327 $ 2,599 $ 193,113 (1) Reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. (2) Includes mortgage-backed securities of U.S. federal agencies. At December 31, 2008, the cost of approximately 5,300 investments in equity and fixed income securities exceeded their fair value by $9.414 billion. Of the $9.414 billion, the gross unrealized loss on equity securities was $459 million. Of the remainder, $5.692 billion represents fixed-income investments that have been in a gross unrealized loss position for less than a year and, of these, 97% are rated investment grade; $3.263 billion represents fixed income investments that have been in a gross unrealized loss position for a year or more and, of these, 91% are rated investment grade. Available-for-sale mortgage-backed securities portfolio fair value balance of $29.868 billion consists of $23.727 billion of government-sponsored agencies securities, and $6.141 billion of privately sponsored securities of which the majority is backed by mortgages that are not Alt-A or subprime. This balance decreased from $63.075 billion as of December 31, 2007, or $33.207 billion, due to unrealized losses, pay-downs received, and the reclassification of Alt-A and non-agency securities from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity investments. The increase in gross unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities was primarily related to a widening of market spreads, reflecting an increase in risk/liquidity premiums. The increase in gross unrealized losses on state and municipal debt securities during 2008 was a result of market disruption, causing reduced liquidity and an increase in municipal bond yields. For these securities, management has asserted significant holding periods that in certain cases now approach maturity of the securities. As discussed in more detail below, the Company conducts and documents periodic reviews of all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment is other than temporary, pursuant to FASB Staff Position No. 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments (FSP FAS 115-1). Any unrealized loss identified as other than temporary is recorded directly in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 158 Table of Contents The table below shows the fair value of investments in available-for-sale securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months or for 12 months or longer as of December 31, 2008 and 2007: Less than 12 months 12 months or longer Total In millions of dollars at year end Fair value Grossunrealized losses Fair value Gross unrealized losses Fair value Gross unrealized losses 2008: Securities available-for-sale Mortgage-backed securities $ 7,800 $ 1,177 $ 3,793 $ 2,019 $ 11,593 $ 3,196 U.S. Treasury and federal agencies 1,654 76 1 1 1,655 77 State and municipal 12,827 3,872 3,762 498 16,589 4,370 Foreign government 10,697 201 9,080 207 19,777 408 U.S. corporate 1,604 214 3,872 376 5,476 590 Other debt securities 1,325 152 824 162 2,149 314 Marketable equity securities available-for-sale 3,254 386 102 73 3,356 459 Total securities available-for-sale $ 39,161 $ 6,078 $ 21,434 $ 3,336 $ 60,595 $ 9,414 2007: Securities available-for-sale Mortgage-backed securities $ 4,432 $ 65 $ 27,221 $ 906 $ 31,653 $ 971 U.S. Treasury and federal agencies 7,369 28 4,431 42 11,800 70 State and municipal 7,944 190 1,079 66 9,023 256 Foreign government 34,929 305 9,598 355 44,527 660 U.S. corporate 1,489 52 1,789 418 3,278 470 Other debt securities 3,214 49 879 65 4,093 114 Marketable equity securities available-for-sale 60 12 39 46 99 58 Total securities available-for-sale $ 59,437 $ 701 $ 45,036 $ 1,898 $ 104,473 $ 2,599 159 Table of Contents The following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of debt securities available-for-sale by contractual maturity dates as of December 31, 2008: In millions of dollars Amortized cost Fair value Mortgage-backed securities (1) Due within 1 year $ 87 $ 80 After 1 but within 5 years 639 567 After 5 but within 10 years 1,362 1,141 After 10 years (2) 30,710 28,080 Total $ 32,798 $ 29,868 U.S. Treasury and federal agencies Due within 1 year $ 15,736 $ 15,846 After 1 but within 5 years 5,755 5,907 After 5 but within 10 years 1,902 1,977 After 10 years (2) 309 235 Total $ 23,702 $ 23,965 State and municipal Due within 1 year $ 214 $ 214 After 1 but within 5 years 84 84 After 5 but within 10 years 411 406 After 10 years (2) 17,647 13,120 Total $ 18,356 $ 13,824 Foreign government Due within 1 year $ 26,481 $ 26,937 After 1 but within 5 years 45,452 45,462 After 5 but within 10 years 6,771 6,899 After 10 years (2) 601 744 Total $ 79,305 $ 80,042 All other (3) Due within 1 year $ 4,160 $ 4,319 After 1 but within 5 years 2,662 2,692 After 5 but within 10 years 12,557 11,842 After 10 years (2) 3,051 2,774 Total $ 22,430 $ 21,627 Total debt securities available-for-sale $ 176,591 $ 169,326 (1) Includes mortgage-backed securities of U.S. federal agencies.

The Company believes that the expected cash flows to be generated from holding the assets significantly exceed their current fair value, which has been significantly and adversely impacted by the reduced liquidity in the global financial markets. SFAS 115 requires transfers of securities out of the trading category be rare. Citigroup made a number of transfers out of the trading and available-for-sale categories in order to better reflect the revised intentions of the Company in response to the recent significant deterioration in market conditions, which were especially acute during the fourth quarter of 2008. These rare market conditions were not foreseen at the initial purchase date of the securities. Most of the debt securities previously classified as trading were bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the short term, many in the context of Citigroups acting as a market maker. At the date of acquisition, most of these positions were liquid, and the Company expected active and frequent buying and selling with the objective of generating profits on short-term differences in price. However, subsequent declines in value of these securities are primarily related to the ongoing widening of market credit spreads reflecting increased risk and liquidity premiums that buyers are currently demanding. As market liquidity has decreased, the primary buyers for these securities have typically demanded returns on investments that are significantly higher than previously experienced. Reclassification of debt securities were made at fair value on the date of transfer. The December 31, 2008 carrying value of the securities transferred from Trading account assets and available-for-sale securities was $33.3 billion and $27.0 billion, respectively. The Company purchased an additional $4.2 billion of held-to-maturity securities during the fourth quarter of 2008, in accordance with prior commitments. 160 Table of Contents The carrying value and fair value of securities held-to-maturity at December 31, 2008: In millions of dollars Amortized cost (1) Net unrealized loss on date of transfer Carrying value (2) Gross unrecognized gains Gross unrecognized losses Fairvalue Debt securities held-to-maturity Mortgage-backed securities $ 37,719 $ 6,981 $ 30,738 $ 43 $ 3,030 $ 27,751 State and municipal 6,051 350 5,701 5 339 5,367 Other debt securities 28,708 688 28,020 212 973 27,259 Total debt securities held-to-maturity $ 72,478 $ 8,019 $ 64,459 $ 260 $ 4,342 $ 60,377 (1) For securities transferred to held-to-maturity from Trading account assets, amortized cost is defined as the fair value amount of the securities at the date of transfer. For securities transferred to held-to-maturity from available-for-sale, amortized cost is defined as the original purchase cost, plus or minus any accretion or amortization of interest, less any impairment previously recognized in earnings. (2) Held-to-maturity securities are carried on the Balance Sheet at amortized cost and the changes in the value of these securities, other than impairment charges, are not reported on the financial statements. The net unrealized losses classified in accumulated other comprehensive income that relates to debt securities reclassified from available-for-sale investments to held-to-maturity investments was $8.0 billion as of December 31, 2008. This balance is amortized over the remaining life of the related securities as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the accretion of discount on the same transferred debt securities. This will have no impact on the Companys net income, because the amortization of the unrealized holding loss reported in equity will offset the effect on interest income of the accretion of the discount on these securities. The held-to-maturity mortgage-backed securities portfolios carrying value of $30.738 billion with a fair value of $27.751 billion as of December 31, 2008, includes the following: In millions of dollars Amortized cost Net unrealized loss on date of transfer Carrying value Gross unrecognized gains Gross unrecognized losses Fairvalue Mortgage-backed securities held-to-maturity U.S. government agency sponsored securities $ 1,716 $ 76 $ 1,640 $  $ 45 $ 1,595 U.S. non-government agency sponsored securities Alt-A 16,658 4,216 12,442 23 1,802 10,663 Prime 7,481 1,436 6,045  623 5,422 Subprime 1,368 125 1,243 15 163 1,095 Non-U.S. mortgage-backed securities 10,496 1,128 9,368 5 397 8,976 Total mortgage-backed securities held-to-maturity $ 37,719 $ 6,981 $ 30,738 $ 43 $ 3,030 $ 27,751 At December 31, 2008, the amortized cost of approximately 1,700 held-to-maturity securities exceeded their fair value.

Excluded from the gross unrealized losses presented in this table is the $8.0 billion of gross unrealized losses recorded in AOCI related to the held-to-maturity securities that were reclassified from available-for-sale investments. Approximately $5.2 billion of these unrealized losses relate to securities with a fair value of $16.9 billion at December 31, 2008, which have been in a loss position for twelve months or longer. 161 Table of Contents The following table presents the carrying value and fair value of debt securities held-to-maturity by contractual maturity dates as of December 31, 2008: In millions of dollars Carryingvalue Fair value Mortgage-backed securities Due within 1 year $ 73 $ 50 After 1 but within 5 years 102 101 After 5 but within 10 years 32 32 After 10 years (1) 30,531 27,568 Total $ 30,738 $ 27,751 State and municipal Due within 1 year $ 138 $ 138 After 1 but within 5 years 137 137 After 5 but within 10 years 105 100 After 10 years (1) 5,321 4,992 Total $ 5,701 $ 5,367 All other (2) Due within 1 year $ 4,448 $ 4,471 After 1 but within 5 years 11,142 10,862 After 5 but within 10 years 6,821 6,604 After 10 years (1) 5,609 5,322 Total $ 28,020 $ 27,259 Total debt securities held-to-maturity $ 64,459 $ 60,377 (1) Investments with no stated maturities are included as contractual maturities of greater than 10 years. Actual maturities may differ due to call or prepayment rights. (2) Includes asset-backed securities and all other debt securities. Evaluating Investments for Other-than-Temporary Impairments The Company conducts periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with FASB Staff Position No. 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments (FSP FAS 115-1). An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses that are determined to be temporary in nature are recorded, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) for available-for-sale securities, while such losses related to held-to-maturity securities are not recorded, as these investments are carried at their amortized cost (less any permanent impairment). For securities transferred to held-to-maturity from Trading account assets, amortized cost is defined as the fair value amount of the securities at the date of transfer. For securities transferred to held-to-maturity from available-for-sale, amortized cost is defined as the original purchase cost, plus or minus any accretion or amortization of interest, less any impairment recognized in earnings. Regardless of the classification of the securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity, the Company has assessed each position for credit impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include:  the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been below cost;  the severity of the impairment;  the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer;  activity in the market of the issuer which may indicate adverse credit conditions; and  the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. The Companys review for impairment generally entails:  identification and evaluation of investments that have indications of possible impairment;  analysis of individual investments that have fair values less than amortized cost, including consideration of the length of time the investment has been in an unrealized loss position and the expected recovery period;  discussion of evidential matter, including an evaluation of factors or triggers that could cause individual investments to qualify as having other-than-temporary impairment and those that would not support other-than-temporary impairment; and  documentation of the results of these analyses, as required under business policies. The extent of the Companys analysis regarding credit quality and the stress on assumptions used in the analysis have been refined for securities where the current fair value or other characteristics of the security warrant. For example, given the declines in fair values of mortgage-backed securities, general concerns regarding housing prices and the delinquency and default rates on the mortgage loans underlying these securities, the Companys analysis for identifying securities for which it is not probable that all principal and interest contractually due will be recovered have been refined. More specifically, for U.S. mortgage-backed securities (and in particular for Alt-A and other mortgage-backed securities that have significant unrealized losses as a percentage of amortized cost), credit impairment is assessed using a cash flow model that estimates the cash flows on the underlying mortgages, using the security-specific collateral and transaction structure. The model estimates cash flows from the underlying mortgage loans and distributes those cash flows to various tranches of securities, considering the transaction structure and any subordination and credit enhancements that exist in that structure. The cash flow model incorporates actual cash flows on the mortgage-backed securities through the current period and then projects the remaining cash flows using a number of assumptions, including default rates, prepayment rates, and recovery rates (on foreclosed properties). 162 Table of Contents Management develops specific assumptions using as much market data as possible and includes internal estimates as well as estimates published by rating agencies and other third-party sources. If the models predict, given the forward-looking assumptions, that it is not probable that a mortgage-backed security will recover all principal and interest due, the Company records other-than-temporary impairment in the Consolidated Statement of Income equal to the entire decline in fair value of the mortgage-backed security. Where a mortgage-backed security held as AFS is not deemed to be credit impaired, management performs additional analysis to assess whether it has the intent and ability to hold each security for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value. In most cases, management has asserted that it has the intent and ability to hold investments for the forecasted recovery period, which in some cases may be the securitys maturity date. Where such an assertion has not been made, the securities decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and is recorded in earnings. Management has asserted significant holding periods for mortgage-backed securities that in certain cases now approach the maturity of the securities. The weighted-average estimated life of the securities is currently approximately 7 years for U.S. mortgage-backed securities. The estimated life of the securities may change depending on future performance of the underlying loans, including prepayment activity and experienced credit losses. In addition, because of the market disruption that occurred late in the third quarter of 2008 for state and municipal debt securities, the analysis regarding these potential impairments have also been refined. As a result of these analyses, during 2008 the Company recorded approximately $2.8 billion of pretax losses for other-than-temporary impairments, $337 million of which was recorded on held-to-maturity investments after they had been reclassified. 17.

(4) Increase in unearned income in 2008 relates to the transfer of loans from the held-for-sale category to the held-for-investment category at a discount to par. Included in the previous loan table are lending products whose terms may give rise to additional credit issues. Credit cards with below-market introductory interest rates, multiple loans supported by the same collateral (e.g., home equity loans), or interest-only loans are examples of such products. However, these products are not material to Citigroups financial position and are closely managed via credit controls that mitigate their additional inherent risk. Impaired loans are those which Citigroup believes it is probable that it will not collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan. Impaired loans include smaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to the borrowers financial difficulties and Citigroup granted a concession to the borrower. Such modifications may include interest rate reductions for other than a temporary period, principal forgiveness and/or term extensions. Valuation allowances for these loans are estimated considering all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original contractual effective rate, the secondary market value of the loan and the fair value of collateral less disposal costs. This excludes smaller-balance homogeneous loans that have not been modified and are carried on a non-accrual basis. 163 Table of Contents The following table presents information about impaired loans: In millions of dollars at year end 2008 2007 2006 Impaired corporate loans $ 9,536 $ 1,735 $ 458 Impaired consumer loans (1) 9,011 241 360 Total impaired loans (2) $ 18,547 $ 1,976 $ 818 Impaired corporate loans with valuation allowances (3) $ 9,531 $ 1,724 $ 439 Impaired consumer loans with valuation allowances 8,573   Impaired corporate valuation allowance (3) $ 2,698 $ 388 $ 122 Impaired consumer valuation allowance 2,373   Total valuation allowances (3)(4) $ 5,071 $ 388 $ 122 During the year Average balance of impaired corporate loans (3) $ 4,163 $ 1,050 $ 767 Average balance of impaired consumer loans 5,266   Interest income recognized on Impaired corporate loans $ 49 $ 101 $ 63 Impaired consumer loans $ 276   (1) Prior to 2008, the Companys financial accounting systems did not separately track impaired smaller-balance, homogeneous Consumer loans whose terms were modified due to the borrowers financial difficulties and it was determined that a concession was granted to the borrower. During 2008, such modified impaired Consumer loans amounted to $8.151 billion. However, information derived from the Companys risk management systems indicates that such modifications were approximately $12.3 billion, $7.0 billion and $4.7 billion at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. (2) Excludes loans purchased for investment purposes. (3) Includes amounts related to Consumer loans not separately tracked in the Company financial accounting systems prior to 2008. (4) Included in the Allowance for loan losses. In addition, included in the loan table are purchased distressed loans, which are loans that have evidenced significant credit deterioration subsequent to origination but prior to acquisition by Citigroup. In conforming to the requirements of Statement of Position No. 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer (SOP 03-3), which became effective in 2005, these purchased loans were reclassified from Other assets to Loans. In accordance with SOP 03-3, the difference between the total expected cash flows for these loans and the initial recorded investments must be recognized in income over the life of the loans using a level yield. Accordingly, these loans have been excluded from the impaired loan information presented above. In addition, per SOP 03-3, subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows for a purchased distressed loan require a build of an allowance so the loan retains its level yield. However, increases in the expected cash flows are first recognized as a reduction of any previously established allowance and then recognized as income prospectively over the remaining life of the loan by increasing the loans level yield. Where the expected cash flows cannot be reliably estimated, the purchased distressed loan is accounted for under the cost recovery method. The carrying amount of the purchased distressed loan portfolio at December 31, 2008 was $1,510 million gross of an allowance of $122 million. The changes in the accretable yield, related allowance and carrying amount net of accretable yield for 2008 are as follows: In millions of dollars Accretable yield Carrying amount of loan receivable Allowance Beginning balance (1) $ 219 $ 2,373 $ 76 Purchases (2) 38 407  Disposals/payments received  (1,457 )  Accretion (171 ) 171  Builds (reductions) to the allowance 4  46 Increase to expected cash flows  42  FX/Other 2 (26 )  Balance, December 31, 2008 (3) $ 92 $ 1,510 $ 122 (1) Reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. (2) The balance reported in the column Carrying amount of loan receivable consists of $114 million of purchased loans accounted for under the level-yield method and $293 million under the cost recovery method. These balances represent the fair value of these loans at their acquisition date. The related total expected cash flows for the level-yield loans were $151 million at their acquisition dates. (3) The balance reported in the column Carrying amount of loan receivable consists of $995 million of loans accounted for under the level-yield method and $515 million accounted for under the cost recovery method. 164 Table of Contents 18.

The changes in estimate were accounted for prospectively. For the quarter ended March 31, 2007, the change in estimate decreased the Companys pretax net income by $170 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. For the quarter ended June 30, 2007, the change in estimate decreased the Companys pretax net income by $240 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. For the quarter ended September 30, 2007, the change in estimate decreased the Companys pretax net income by $900 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. (2) Consumer credit losses primarily relate to U.S. mortgages, revolving credit and installment loans. Recoveries primarily relate to revolving credit and installment loans.

(2) Other changes in goodwill primarily reflect foreign exchange effects on non-dollar-denominated goodwill, as well as purchase accounting adjustments. (3) As of June 30, 2008, the Companys structure was reorganized and new operating segments were established. As goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, reporting units under the new operating segments have been established. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at a level below the business segments (referred to as a reporting unit). Changes in the management structure in 2008 resulted in the creation of new business segments. As a result, commencing with the third quarter of 2008, the Company identified new reporting units as required under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). Goodwill affected by the reorganization has been reallocated from seven reporting units to ten, using a relative fair-value approach. Subsequent to the reorganization, goodwill was reallocated to disposals and tested for impairment under the new reporting units. During 2008, the share prices of financial stocks continued to be very volatile and were under considerable pressure in sustained turbulent markets. In this environment, Citigroups market capitalization remained below book value for most of the period and the Company performed goodwill impairment testing for all reporting units as of February 28, 2008, July 1, 2008 and December 31, 2008. In addition, the Company performed impairment testing for selected reporting units as of May 31, 2008 (Citigroup Alternative Investments) and October 31, 2008 (Securities and Banking, North America Consumer Banking and Latin America Consumer 166 Table of Contents Banking). The results of the first step of the impairment test showed no indication of impairment in any of the reporting units at any of the periods except December 31, 2008 and, accordingly, the Company did not perform the second step of the impairment test, except for the test performed as of December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, there was an indication of impairment in the North America Consumer Banking, Latin America Consumer Banking and EMEA Consumer Banking reporting units and, accordingly, the second step of testing was performed on these reporting units. Based on the results of the second step of testing, the Company recorded a $9.6 billion pretax ($8.7 billion after tax) goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2008, representing the entire amount of goodwill allocated to these reporting units. The primary cause for the goodwill impairment in the above reporting units was the rapid deterioration in the financial markets, as well as in the global economic outlook particularly during the period beginning mid-November through year end 2008. This deterioration further weakened the near-term prospects for the financial services industry. These and other factors, including the increased possibility of further government intervention, also resulted in the decline in the Companys market capitalization from approximately $90 billion at July 1, 2008 and approximately $74 billion at October 31, 2008 to approximately $36 billion at December 31, 2008. The more significant fair-value adjustments in the pro forma purchase price allocation in the second step of testing were to fair-value loans and debt and were made to identify and value identifiable intangibles. The adjustments to measure the assets, liabilities and intangibles were for the purpose of measuring the implied fair value of goodwill and such adjustments are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following table shows reporting units with goodwill balances and the excess of fair value of allocated book value as of December 31, 2008. Reporting Unit ($ in millions) Fair Value as a % ofAllocated Book Value Goodwill (post-impairment) North America Cards 139 % 6,765 International Cards 218 % 4,066 Asia Consumer Banking 293 % 3,106 Securities & Banking 109 % 9,774 Global Transaction Services 994 % 1,570 North America GWM 386 % 1,259 International GWM 171 % 592 While no impairment was noted in step one of our Securities and Banking reporting unit impairment test at October 31, 2008 and December 31, 2008, goodwill present in that reporting unit may be particularly sensitive to further deterioration in economic conditions. Under the market approach for valuing this reporting unit, the earnings multiples and transaction multiples were selected from multiples obtained using data from guideline companies and acquisitions. The selection of the actual multiple considers operating performance and financial condition such as return on equity and net income growth of Securities and Banking as compared to the guideline companies and acquisitions. For the valuation under the income approach, the Company utilized a discount rate which it believes reflects the risk and uncertainty related to the projected cash flows, and selected 2013 as the terminal year. In 2013, the value was derived assuming a return to historical levels of core-business profitability for the reporting unit, despite the significant losses experienced in 2008. This assumption is based on managements view that this recovery will occur based upon various macro- economic factors such as the recent U.S. government stimulus actions, restoring marketplace confidence and improved risk-management practices on an industry-wide basis. Furthermore, Company-specific actions such as its recently announced realignment of its businesses to optimize its global businesses for future profitable growth, will also be a factor in returning the Companys core Securities and Banking business to historical levels. Small deterioration in the assumptions used in the valuations, in particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used in the net income projections, could significantly affect the Companys impairment evaluation and, hence, results. If the future were to differ adversely from managements best estimate of key economic assumptions and associated cash flows were to decrease by a small margin, the Company could potentially experience future material impairment charges with respect to the goodwill remaining in our Securities and Banking reporting unit. Any such charges by themselves would not negatively affect the Companys Tier 1 and Total Regulatory Capital Ratios, Tangible Capital or the Companys liquidity position. 167 Table of Contents Intangible Assets The components of intangible assets were as follows: December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 In millions of dollars Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net carrying amount Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net carrying amount Purchased credit card relationships $ 8,443 $ 4,513 $ 3,930 $ 8,499 $ 4,045 $ 4,454 Core deposit intangibles 1,345 662 683 1,435 518 917 Other customer relationships 4,031 168 3,863 2,746 197 2,549 Present value of future profits 415 264 151 427 257 170 Other (1) 5,343 1,285 4,058 5,783 1,157 4,626 Total amortizing intangible assets $ 19,577 $ 6,892 $ 12,685 $ 18,890 $ 6,174 $ 12,716 Indefinite-lived intangible assets 1,474 N/A 1,474 1,591 N/A 1,591 Mortgage servicing rights 5,657 N/A 5,657 8,380 N/A 8,380 Total intangible assets $ 26,708 $ 6,892 $ 19,816 $ 28,861 $ 6,174 $ 22,687 (1) Includes contract-related intangible assets.

In April 2008, substantially all unaffiliated investors had notified Old Lane of their intention to redeem their investments. Based on the Companys expectation of the level of redemptions in the fund, the Company expected that the cash flows from the hedge fund management contract will be lower than previously estimated. The Company performed an impairment analysis of the intangible asset relating to the hedge fund management contract. As a result, an impairment loss of $202 million, representing the remaining unamortized balance of the intangible assets, was recorded in the first quarter of 2008 operating expenses in the results of the ICG segment. The fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. (2) In the fourth quarter of 2008, Citigroup recorded a $937 million impairment charge on a Nikko Asset Management contract intangible. During the fourth quarter, it was determined that triggering events occurred that required further testing of the intangible assets for impairment, which resulted in the $937 million impairment charge.

Its U.S. insured depository institution subsidiaries, including Citibank, N.A., are subject to similar guidelines issued by their respective primary federal bank regulatory agencies. These guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and include the required minimums shown in the following table. The regulatory agencies are required by law to take specific prompt actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, all of Citigroups U.S. insured subsidiary depository institutions were well capitalized. At December 31, 2008, regulatory capital as set forth in guidelines issued by the U.S. federal bank regulators is as follows: In millions of dollars Requiredminimum Well-capitalizedminimum Citigroup (3) Citibank, N.A. (3) Tier 1 Capital $ 118,758 $ 70,977 Total Capital (1) 156,398 108,355 Tier 1 Capital Ratio 4.0 % 6.0 % 11.92 % 9.94 % Total Capital Ratio (1) 8.0 10.0 15.70 15.18 Leverage Ratio (2) 3.0 5.0 (3) 6.08 5.82 (1) Total Capital includes Tier 1 and Tier 2. (2) Tier 1 Capital divided by adjusted average assets. (3) Applicable only to depository institutions. For bank holding companies to be well capitalized, they must maintain a minimum Leverage Ratio of 3%. Banking Subsidiaries There are various legal limitations on the ability of Citigroups subsidiary depository institutions to extend credit, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to Citigroup and its non-bank subsidiaries. The approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in the case of national banks, or the Office of Thrift Supervision, in the case of federal savings banks, is required if total dividends declared in any calendar year exceed amounts specified by the applicable agencys regulations. State-chartered depository institutions are subject to dividend limitations imposed by applicable state law. As of December 31, 2008, Citigroups subsidiary depository institutions can declare dividends to their parent companies, without regulatory approval, of approximately $69 million. In determining the dividends, each depository institution must also consider its effect on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies that indicate that banking organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Non-Banking Subsidiaries Citigroup also receives dividends from its non-bank subsidiaries. These non-bank subsidiaries are generally not subject to regulatory restrictions on dividends. The ability of CGMHI to declare dividends can be restricted by capital considerations of its broker-dealer subsidiaries.

(3) Additional minimum liability, as required by SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87), related to unfunded or book reserve plans, such as the U.S. nonqualified pension plans and certain foreign pension plans. (4) The after-tax adjustment to the opening balance of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) represents the reclassification of the unrealized gains (losses) related to the Legg Mason securities, as well as several miscellaneous items previously reported in accordance with SFAS 115. The related unrealized gains and losses were reclassified to Retained earnings upon the adoption of the fair value option in accordance with SFAS 159. See Notes 1 and 27 on pages 121 and 200, respectively, for further discussions. (5) Primarily driven by Citigroups pay fixed/receive floating rate swap programs that are hedging the floating rate on deposits and long-term debt. The declining market interest rates in 2007 and 2008 have had a negative impact on the cash flow hedges portfolio. (6) Reflects adjustments to funded status of pension and postretirement plans as required by SFAS 158, which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of the plans assets. (7) The net unrealized loss related to securities transferred to held-to-maturity is $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2008. 174 Table of Contents 23. SECURITIZATIONS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES Overview Citigroup and its subsidiaries are involved with several types of off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities (SPEs). See Note 1 on page 122 for a discussion of proposed accounting changes to SFAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities (SFAS 140), and FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (revised December 2003) (FIN 46 (R)). Uses of SPEs An SPE is an entity designed to fulfill a specific limited need of the company that organized it. The principal uses of SPEs are to obtain liquidity and favorable capital treatment by securitizing certain of Citigroups financial assets, to assist clients in securitizing their financial assets, and to create investment products for clients. SPEs may be organized in many legal forms including trusts, partnerships, or corporations. In a securitization, the company transferring assets to an SPE converts those assets into cash before they would have been realized in the normal course of business, through the SPEs issuance of debt and equity instruments, certificates, commercial paper, and other notes of indebtedness, which are recorded on the balance sheet of the SPE and not reflected on the transferring companys balance sheet, assuming applicable accounting requirements are satisfied. Investors usually have recourse to the assets in the SPE and often benefit from other credit enhancements, such as a collateral account or overcollateralization in the form of excess assets in the SPE, or from a liquidity facility, such as a line of credit, liquidity put option or asset purchase agreement. The SPE can typically obtain a more favorable credit rating from rating agencies than the transferor could obtain for its own debt issuances, resulting in less expensive financing costs. The SPE may also enter into derivative contracts in order to convert the yield or currency of the underlying assets to match the needs of the SPE investors, or to limit or change the credit risk of the SPE. Citigroup may be the provider of certain credit enhancements as well as the counterparty to any related derivative contracts. SPEs may be Qualifying SPEs (QSPEs) or Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) or neither. Qualifying SPEs QSPEs are a special class of SPEs defined in (SFAS 140). QSPEs have significant limitations on the types of assets and derivative instruments they may own or enter into and the types and extent of activities and decision-making they may engage in. Generally, QSPEs are passive entities designed to purchase assets and pass through the cash flows from those assets to the investors in the QSPE. QSPEs may not actively manage their assets through discretionary sales and are generally limited to making decisions inherent in servicing activities and issuance of liabilities. QSPEs are generally exempt from consolidation by the transferor of assets to the QSPE and any investor or counterparty. Variable Interest Entities VIEs are entities defined in (FIN 46(R)), as entities that have either a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest (i.e., ability to make significant decisions through voting rights, right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity and obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity). Investors that finance the VIE through debt or equity interests or other counterparties that provide other forms of support, such as guarantees, subordinated fee arrangements, or certain types of derivative contracts, are variable interest holders in the entity. The variable interest holder, if any, that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. Consolidation under FIN 46(R) is based on expected losses and residual returns, which consider various scenarios on a probability-weighted basis. Consolidation of a VIE is, therefore, determined based primarily on variability generated in scenarios that are considered most likely to occur, rather than based on scenarios that are considered more remote. Certain variable interests may absorb significant amounts of losses or residual returns contractually, but if those scenarios are considered very unlikely to occur, they may not lead to consolidation of the VIE. All of these facts and circumstances are taken into consideration when determining whether the Company has variable interests that would deem it the primary beneficiary and, therefore, require consolidation of the related VIE or otherwise rise to the level where disclosure would provide useful information to the users of the Companys financial statements. In some cases, it is qualitatively clear based on the extent of the Companys involvement or the seniority of its investments that the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE. In other cases, a more detailed and quantitative analysis is required to make such a determination. The Company generally considers the following types of involvement to be significant:  assisting in the structuring of a transaction and retaining any amount of debt financing (e.g., loans, notes, bonds or other debt instruments) or an equity investment (e.g., common shares, partnership interests or warrants);  writing a liquidity put or other liquidity facility to support the issuance of short-term notes;  writing credit protection (e.g., guarantees, letters of credit, credit default swaps or total return swaps where the Company receives the total return or risk on the assets held by the VIE); or  certain transactions where the Company is the investment manager and receives variable fees for services. In various other transactions, the Company may act as a derivative counterparty (for example, interest rate swap, cross-currency swap, or purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the SPE); may act as underwriter or placement agent; may provide administrative, trustee, or other services; or may make a market in debt securities or other instruments issued by VIEs. The Company generally considers such involvement, by itself, not significant under FIN 46(R). 175 Table of Contents Citigroups involvement with QSPEs, Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs with which the Company holds significant variable interests as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 is presented below: In millions of dollars As of December 31, 2008 Maximum exposure to loss in significantunconsolidated VIEs (1) Funded exposures (3) Unfunded exposures (4) Totalinvolvementwith SPEassets QSPEassets ConsolidatedVIE assets SignificantunconsolidatedVIE assets (2) Debtinvestments Equityinvestments Fundingcommitments Guaranteesandderivatives Consumer Banking Credit card securitizations $ 123,867 $ 123,867 $  $  $  $  $  $  Mortgage securitizations 584,154 584,151 3      Student loan securitizations 15,650 15,650       Other 1,446  1,446      Total $ 725,117 $ 723,668 $ 1,449 $  $  $  $  $  Institutional Clients Group Citi-administered asset-backed commercial paper conduits (ABCP) $ 59,635 $  $  $ 59,635 $  $  $ 59,435 $ 200 Third-party commercial paper conduits 20,755   20,755 2  1,380 17 Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) 29,055  11,466 17,589 928  230 315 Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) 20,253  122 20,131 1,430  14  Mortgage loan securitization 87,209 87,209       Asset-based financing 102,154  3,847 98,307 25,275 45 2,799 112 Municipal securities tender option bond trusts (TOBs) 30,071 6,504 14,619 8,948 652 3 7,067 162 Municipal investments 17,138  866 16,272  2,746 790  Client intermediation 9,464  3,811 5,653 1,537    Structured investment vehicles (SIVs)         Investment funds 10,556  2,157 8,399  156 2  Other 21,668 4,751 8,527 8,390 784 99 379  Total $ 407,958 $ 98,464 $ 45,415 $ 264,079 $ 30,608 $ 3,049 $ 72,096 $ 806 Global Wealth Management Investment funds $ 71 $  $ 45 $ 26 $ 22 $  $ 10 $  Other 9  9      Total $ 80 $  $ 54 $ 26 $ 22 $  $ 10 $  Corporate/Other Trust preferred securities $ 23,899 $  $  $ 23,899 $  $ 162 $  $  Total Citigroup $ 1,157,054 $ 822,132 $ 46,918 $ 288,004 $ 30,630 $ 3,211 $ 72,106 $ 806 (1) The definition of maximum exposure to loss is included in the text that follows.

(2) A significant unconsolidated VIE is an entity where the Company has any variable interest considered to be significant as discussed on page 174, regardless of the likelihood of loss or the notional amount of exposure. (3) The definition of maximum exposure to loss is included in the text that follows. 177 Table of Contents This table does not include:  certain venture capital investments made by some of the Companys private equity subsidiaries, as the Company accounts for these investments in accordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide;  certain limited partnerships where the Company is the general partner and the limited partners have the right to replace the general partner or liquidate the funds;  certain investment funds for which the Company provides investment management services and personal estate trusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee and/or investment management services;  VIEs structured by third parties where the Company holds securities in inventory. These investments are made on arms-length terms; and  transferred assets to a VIE where the transfer did not qualify as a sale and where the Company did not have any other involvement that is deemed to be a variable interest with the VIE. These transfers are accounted for as secured borrowings by the Company. The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the legal form of the asset (e.g., security or loan) and the Companys standard accounting policies for the asset type and line of business. The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs where the Company has significant involvement represent the most current information available to the Company. In most cases, the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments in fair value, unless fair value information is readily available to the Company. For VIEs that obtain asset exposures synthetically through derivative instruments (for example, synthetic CDOs), the Company includes the full original notional amount of the derivative as an asset. The maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the Companys investment in the VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE plus any accrued interest and is adjusted for any impairments in value recognized in earnings and any cash principal payments received. The maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount, including liquidity and credit facilities provided by the Company, or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest, adjusted for any declines in fair value recognized in earnings. In certain transactions, the Company has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the VIE under FIN 46(R) (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, or where the Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure amounts. Consolidated VIEsBalance Sheet Classification The following table presents the carrying amounts and classification of consolidated assets that are collateral for consolidated VIE obligations: In billions of dollars December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Cash $ 1.9 $ 12.3 Trading account assets 22.2 87.3 Investments 17.5 15.0 Loans 2.6 2.2 Other assets 2.7 4.8 Total assets of consolidated VIEs $ 46.9 $ 121.6 The following table presents the carrying amounts and classification of the third-party liabilities of the consolidated VIEs: In billions of dollars December 31, 2008 Trading account liabilities $ 0.8 Short-term borrowings 17.0 Long-term debt 6.8 Other liabilities 3.0 Total liabilities of consolidated VIEs $ 27.6 The consolidated VIEs included in the table above represent hundreds of separate entities with which the Company is involved. In general, the third-party investors in the obligations of consolidated VIEs have recourse only to the assets of the VIEs and do not have recourse to the Company, except where the Company has provided a guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to certain derivative transactions involving the VIE. In addition, the assets are generally restricted only to pay such liabilities. Thus, the Companys maximum exposure to loss related to consolidated VIEs is significantly less than the carrying value of the consolidated VIE assets due to outstanding third-party financing. Intercompany liabilities are excluded from the table. Significant Interest in VIEsBalance Sheet Classification The following table presents the carrying amounts and classification of significant interests in VIEs: In billions of dollars December 31, 2008 Trading account assets $ 6.3 Investments 8.4 Loans 15.9 Other assets 3.1 Total assets $ 33.7 In billions of dollars December 31, 2008 Trading account liabilities $ 0.2 Long-term debt 0.4 Other liabilities 0.6 Total liabilities $ 1.2 178 Table of Contents The Companys unfunded exposure to loss is determined based on the Companys maximum contractual commitment less these liabilities recognized in the Balance Sheet as displayed above. Credit Card Securitizations The Company securitizes credit card receivables through trusts which are established to purchase the receivables. Citigroup sells receivables into the QSPE trusts on a non-recourse basis. Credit card securitizations are revolving securitizations; that is, as customers pay their credit card balances, the cash proceeds are used to purchase new receivables and replenish the receivables in the trust. The Company relies on securitizations to fund a significant portion of its managed North America Cards business. The following table reflects amounts related to the Companys securitized credit card receivables at December 31, 2008 and 2007: In billions of dollars 2008 2007 Principal amount of credit card receivables in trusts $ 123.9 $ 125.1 Ownership interests in principal amount of trust credit card receivables: Sold to investors via trust-issued securities 98.2 102.3 Retained by Citigroup as trust-issued securities 6.5 4.5 Retained by Citigroup via non-certificated interests recorded as consumer loans 19.2 18.3 Total ownership interests in principal amount of trust credit card receivables $ 123.9 $ 125.1 Other amounts recorded on the balance sheet related to interests retained in the trusts: Other retained interest in securitized assets $ 3.1 $ 3.0 Residual interest in securitized assets(1) 1.7 3.4 Amounts payable to trusts 1.7 1.6 (1) Includes net unbilled interest in sold balances of $0.6 billion and $0.7 billion as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company recorded net gains (losses) from securitization of credit card receivables of $(1,534) million, $1,084 million and $1,267 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net gains (losses) reflect the following:  incremental gains (losses) from new securitizations;  the reversal of the allowance for loan losses associated with receivables sold;  net gains on replenishments of the trust assets offset by other-than-temporary impairments; and  mark-to-market changes for the portion of the residual interest classified as trading assets. The following table summarizes selected cash flow information related to credit card securitizations for the years 2008, 2007 and 2006: In billions of dollars 2008 2007 2006 Proceeds from new securitizations $ 28.7 $ 36.2 $ 20.2 Proceeds from collections reinvested in new receivables 214.3 218.0 213.1 Contractual servicing fees received 2.0 2.1 2.1 Cash flows received on retained interests and other net cash flows 7.2 7.6 7.9 Key assumptions used for the securitization of credit cards during 2008 and 2007 in measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or securitization are as follows: 2008 2007 Discount rate 13.3% to 20.9 % 12.7% to 16.8 % Constant prepayment rate 5.8% to 21.1 % 6.5% to 22.0 % Anticipated net credit losses 4.7% to 9.9 % 3.4% to 6.4 % There are two primary trusts through which the Company securitizes credit card receivables. The valuation of retained interests is performed separately for each trust, resulting in the disclosed range for the key assumptions. The constant prepayment rate assumption range reflects the projected payment rates over the life of a credit card balance, excluding new card purchases. This results in a high payment in the early life of the securitized balances followed by a much lower payment rate, which is depicted in the disclosed range. The effect of two negative changes in each of the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of retained interests is required to be disclosed. The negative effect of each change must be calculated independently, holding all other assumptions constant. Because the key assumptions may not in fact be independent, the net effect of simultaneous adverse changes in the key assumptions may be less than the sum of the individual effects shown below. At December 31, 2008, the key assumptions used to value retained interests and the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of 10% and 20% in each of the key assumptions were as follows: 2008 Discount rate 16.2% to 19.7 % Constant prepayment rate 5.8% to 18.8 % Anticipated net credit losses 7.4% to 9.9 % In millions of dollars Residualinterest Retainedcertificates Otherretainedinterests Carrying value of retained interests $ 1,069 $ 6,050 $ 3,763 Discount rates Adverse change of 10% $ (36 ) $ (63 ) $ (10 ) Adverse change of 20% (70 ) (126 ) (20 ) Constant prepayment rate Adverse change of 10% $ (81 ) $  $  Adverse change of 20% (153 )   Anticipated net credit losses Adverse change of 10% $ (273 ) $  $ (66 ) Adverse change of 20% (541 )  (133 ) Managed Loans After securitization of credit card receivables, the Company continues to maintain credit card customer account relationships and provides servicing for receivables transferred to the trusts. As a result, the Company considers the securitized credit card receivables to be part of the business it manages. The following tables present a reconciliation between the managed basis and on-balance sheet credit card portfolios and the related delinquencies (loans which are 90 days or more past due) and credit losses, net of recoveries. 179 Table of Contents In millions of dollars, except loans in billions 2008 2007 Loan amounts, at year end On balance sheet $ 87.5 $ 93.5 Securitized amounts(1) 105.9 108.1 Loans held-for-sale  1.0 Total managed loans $ 193.4 $ 202.6 Delinquencies, at year end On balance sheet $ 2,490 $ 1,929 Securitized amounts 2,655 1,864 Loans held-for-sale  14 Total managed delinquencies $ 5,145 $ 3,807 Credit losses, net of recoveries, for the year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 On balance sheet $ 5,918 $ 3,877 $ 3,208 Securitized amounts 7,407 4,728 3,986 Loans held-for-sale   5 Total managed $ 13,325 $ 8,605 $ 7,199 (1) Includes $1.2 billion in interest and fee receivables. Funding, Liquidity Facilities and Subordinate Interests Citigroup securitizes credit card receivables through three securitization trusts. The trusts are funded through a mix of sources, including commercial paper and medium- and long-term notes. Term notes can be issued at a fixed or floating rate. The Omni Trust has issued approximately $3.3 billion of commercial paper through the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). Citigroup is a provider of liquidity facilities to the commercial paper programs of the two primary securitization trusts with which it transacts. Both facilities are made available on market terms to each trust. With respect to the Palisades commercial paper program in the Omni Master Trust (the Omni Trust), Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., a wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, is the sole provider of a full-liquidity facility. The liquidity facility requires Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. to purchase Palisadess commercial paper at maturity if the commercial paper does not roll over as long as there are available credit enhancements outstanding, typically in the form of subordinated notes. The Palisades liquidity commitment amounted to $8.5 billion at December 31, 2008 and $7.5 billion at December 31, 2007, respectively. During 2008, Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. also became the sole provider of a full-liquidity facility to the Dakota commercial paper program of the Citibank Master Credit Card Trust (the Master Trust). This facility requires Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. to purchase Dakota commercial paper at maturity if the commercial paper does not roll over as long as there are available credit enhancements outstanding, typically in the form of subordinated notes. The Dakota liquidity commitment amounted to $11 billion at December 31, 2008. In addition, during 2008 Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. entered into an agreement to provide liquidity to a third-party non-consolidated multi-seller commercial paper conduit (the Conduit), which is not a VIE. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. provides this facility on market terms. The Conduit holds a $3.6 billion bond issued by the Omni Trust. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. will be required to act in its capacity as liquidity provider as long as there are available credit enhancements outstanding and if: (1) the Conduit is unable to roll over its maturing commercial paper; or (2) Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. loses its A-1/P-1 credit rating. At December 31, 2008, the liquidity commitment for this transaction was $4.0 billion. In October 2008, Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. acquired subordinated bonds issued by the Omni Trust having an aggregate notional principal of $265 million. The issuance of these bonds by the Omni Trust to Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. was effected in order to avert a downgrade of all of Omni Trusts outstanding AAA and A securities by Standard & Poors. The subordinated notes pay interest installments and principal upon maturity in December 2009. As a result of this action, the Company is currently holding ongoing discussions with Board staff from the Federal Reserve regarding the application of the associated risk-based capital requirements. The action will increase risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating the Companys risk-based capital ratios. However, the timing and extent of the increase is not yet certain, pending completion of discussions with the Federal Reserve. In December 2008, the excess spread for the Master Trust fell below the trigger level of 4.50%. Beginning in January 2009, this event requires the excess cash in the Master Trust to be diverted to a spread account set aside for the benefit of the investors in the Trust, instead of reverting back to Citigroup immediately. The excess spread is a measure of the profitability of the credit card accounts in the Master Trust expressed as a percent of the principal balance outstanding. If the three-month average excess spread stays between 4.00% and 4.50% of the outstanding principal balance, the required funding of the spread account is $680 million. The funds in the spread account can only be paid to investors if the Master Trust goes into liquidation. If the three-month average excess spread moves back above the 4.50% trigger level, the funds in the spread account will be released to Citigroup. In February 2009, Standard & Poors placed its BBB rating on the Master Trust Class C notes on ratings watch negative. This status applies for 90 days, at which time Standard & Poors will re-evaluate the credit rating of the bonds unless Citigroup takes action in the interim. In response, the Company has decided to issue a Class D note as well as subordinate a portion of principal cash flows due to the Company in the form of non-certificated sellers interest. Citigroup expects to issue the Class D note in the second quarter of 2009 and to effect the subordination of sellers interest cash flows in March 2009. Should these actions be deemed satisfactory, the Class C bonds will be removed from ratings watch negative and the BBB rating will be affirmed by S&P. If these actions are executed, Citigroups risk-weighted assets will be increased, but the timing and extent of such increase would not yet be certain pending resolution of discussions with the Federal Reserve. Mortgage Securitizations The Company provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to a diverse customer base. In connection with the securitization of these loans, the Companys U.S. Consumer mortgage business retains the servicing rights, which entitle the Company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of the loans and the contractual servicing fee. Failure to service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees. In non-recourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Company is the cost of temporary advances of funds. In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as FNMA or FHLMC, or with a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing occur primarily when foreclosure sale proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the 180 Table of Contents outstanding principal balance and accrued interest of the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Companys mortgage loan securitizations are primarily non-recourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the trust. Securities and Banking retains servicing for a limited number of its mortgage securitizations. The Companys Consumer business provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to its customers. Once originated, the Company often securitizes these loans through the use of QSPEs. These QSPEs are funded through the issuance of Trust Certificates backed solely by the transferred assets. These certificates have the same average life as the transferred assets. In addition to providing a source of liquidity and less expensive funding, securitizing these assets also reduces the Companys credit exposure to the borrowers. These mortgage loan securitizations are primarily non-recourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the trust. However, the Company generally retains the servicing rights and in certain instances retains investment securities, interest-only strips and residual interests in future cash flows from the trusts. The following tables summarize selected cash flow information related to mortgage securitizations for the years 2008, 2007 and 2006: 2008 In billions of dollars U.S. Consumermortgages Securities andBankingmortgages Proceeds from new securitizations $89.2 $6.3 Contractual servicing fees received 2.1  Cash flows received on retained interests and other net cash flows 0.7 0.2 2007 In billions of dollars U.S. Consumermortgages Securities andBankingmortgages Proceeds from new securitizations $ 107.2 $ 40.1 Contractual servicing fees received 1.7  Cash flows received on retained interests and other net cash flows 0.3 0.3 2006 In billions of dollars U.S. Consumermortgages Securities andBankingmortgages Proceeds from new securitizations $67.5 $ 31.9 Contractual servicing fees received 1.0  Cash flows received on retained interests and other net cash flows  0.2 The Company recognized gains (losses) on securitizations of U.S. Consumer mortgages of $73 million, $(27) million, and $82 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gains (losses) recognized on the securitization of Securities and Banking activities during 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $(16) million, $145 million and $302 million, respectively. Key assumptions used for the securitization of mortgages during 2008 and 2007 in measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or securitization are as follows: 2008 U.S. Consumermortgages Securities andBanking mortgages Discount rate 4.5% to 18.2 % 5.1% to 39.4 % Constant prepayment rate 3.6% to 32.9 % 2.0% to 18.2 % Anticipated net credit losses  40.0% to 85.0 % 2007 U.S. Consumermortgages Securities andBanking mortgages Discount rate 9.6% to 17.5 % 2.5% to 30.1 % Constant prepayment rate 4.9% to 24.2 % 6.1% to 52.5 % Anticipated net credit losses  10.0% to 100.0 % In 2008, U.S. Consumer mortgage rates exhibited considerable variability due to economic conditions and market volatility. This resulted in a significant variation in assumed prepayment rates and discount rates. The range in the key assumptions for retained interests in Securities and Banking is due to the different characteristics of the interests retained by the Company. The interests retained by Securities and Banking range from highly rated and/or senior in the capital structure to unrated and/or residual interests. The effect of two negative changes in each of the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of retained interests is required to be disclosed. The negative effect of each change must be calculated independently, holding all other assumptions constant. Because the key assumptions may not in fact be independent, the net effect of simultaneous adverse changes in the key assumptions may be less than the sum of the individual effects shown below. At December 31, 2008, the key assumptions used to value retained interests and the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of 10% and 20% in each of the key assumptions were as follows: 2008 U.S.Consumermortgages Securitiesand Bankingmortgages Discount rate 7.8 % 5.1% to 39.4 % Constant prepayment rate 30.6 % 2.0% to 18.2 % Anticipated net credit losses 0.1% 40.0% to 85% In millions of dollars U.S.Consumermortgages Securities andBankingmortgages Carrying value of retained interests $ 7,571 $ 956 Discount rates Adverse change of 10% $ (149 ) $ (45 ) Adverse change of 20% (290 ) (90 ) Constant prepayment rate Adverse change of 10% $ (480 ) $ (9 ) Adverse change of 20% (910 ) (18 ) Anticipated net credit losses Adverse change of 10% $ (26 ) $ (62 ) Adverse change of 20% (49 ) (113 ) 181 Table of Contents Mortgage Servicing Rights The fair value of capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights (MSR) was $5.7 billion and $8.4 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The MSRs correspond to principal loan balances of $662 billion and $586 billion as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The following table summarizes the changes in capitalized MSRs: In millions of dollars 2008 2007 Balance, beginning of year $ 8,380 $ 5,439 Originations 1,311 1,843 Purchases 1 3,678 Changes in fair value of MSRs due to changes in inputs and assumptions (2,682 ) (247 ) Transfer to Trading account assets (163 ) (1,026 ) Other changes (1) (1,190 ) (1,307 ) Balance, end of year $ 5,657 $ 8,380 (1) Represents changes due to customer payments and passage of time. The market for MSRs is not sufficiently liquid to provide participants with quoted market prices. Therefore, the Company uses an option-adjusted spread valuation approach to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates. The key assumptions used in the valuation of MSRs include mortgage prepayment speeds and discount rates. The model assumptions and the MSRs fair value estimates are compared to observable trades of similar MSR portfolios and interest-only security portfolios, as available, as well as to MSR broker valuations and industry surveys. The cash flow model and underlying prepayment and interest rate models used to value these MSRs are subject to validation in accordance with the Companys model validation policies. The fair value of the MSRs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates. In managing this risk, the Company economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed securities and purchased securities classified as trading. The Company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages. The amount of these fees for the years ending December 31, were as follows: In millions of dollars 2008 2007 2006 Servicing fees $2,121 $ 1,683 $ 1,036 Late fees 123 90 56 Ancillary fees 81 61 45 Total MSR fees $ 2,325 $ 1,834 $ 1,137 These fees are classified in the Consolidated Statement of Income as Commissions and fees. Student Loan Securitizations The Company maintains programs to securitize certain portfolios of student loan assets. Under the Companys securitization programs, transactions qualifying as sales are off-balance sheet transactions in which the loans are removed from the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and sold to a QSPE. These QSPEs are funded through the issuance of pass-through term notes collateralized solely by the trust assets. For off-balance sheet securitizations, the Company generally retains interests in the form of subordinated residual interests (i.e., interest-only strips) and servicing rights. Under terms of the trust arrangements the Company has no obligations to provide financial support and has not provided such support. A substantial portion of the credit risk associated with the securitized loans has been transferred to third party guarantors or insurers either under the Federal Family Education Loan Program, authorized by the U.S. Department of Education under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, or private credit insurance. The following table summarizes selected cash flow information related to student loan securitizations for the years 2008, 2007 and 2006: In billions of dollars 2008 2007 2006 Proceeds from new securitizations $ 2.0 $ 2.9 $ 7.6 Contractual servicing fees received 0.1 0.1  Cash flows received on retained interests and other net cash flows 0.1 0.1  Key assumptions used for the securitization of student loans during 2008 and 2007 in measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or securitization are as follows: 2008 2007 Discount rate 10.6% 5.9% to 10.5 % Constant prepayment rate 9.0% 3.1% to 3.8 % Anticipated net credit losses 0.5% 0.3 % At December 31, 2008, the key assumptions used to value retained interests and the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of 10% and 20% in each of the key assumptions were as follows: Retained interests Discount rate 3.9% to 13.4 % Constant prepayment rate 0.8% to 8.9 % Anticipated net credit losses 0.3% to 0.7 % In millions of dollars Retained interests Carrying value of retained interests $ 1,151 Discount rates Adverse change of 10% $ (26 ) Adverse change of 20% (51 ) Constant prepayment rate Adverse change of 10% $ (9 ) Adverse change of 20% (17 ) Anticipated net credit losses Adverse change of 10% $ (6 ) Adverse change of 20% (13 ) 182 Table of Contents On-Balance Sheet Securitizations The Company engages in on-balance sheet securitizations. These are securitizations that do not qualify for sales treatment; thus, the assets remain on the Companys balance sheet. The following table presents the carrying amounts and classification of consolidated assets and liabilities transferred in transactions from the consumer credit card, student loan, mortgage and auto businesses, accounted for as secured borrowings: In billions of dollars December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Cash $ 0.3 $ 0.1 Available-for-sale securities 0.1 0.2 Loans 7.5 7.4 Allowance for loan losses (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Total assets $ 7.8 $ 7.6 Long-term debt $ 6.3 $ 5.8 Other liabilities 0.3 0.4 Total liabilities $ 6.6 $ 6.2 All assets are restricted from being sold or pledged as collateral. The cash flows from these assets are the only source used to pay down the associated liabilities, which are non-recourse to the Companys general assets. Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduits The Company is active in the asset-backed commercial paper conduit business as administrator of several multi-seller commercial paper conduits, and also as a service provider to single-seller and other commercial paper conduits sponsored by third parties. The multi-seller commercial paper conduits are designed to provide the Companys customers access to low-cost funding in the commercial paper markets. The conduits purchase assets from or provide financing facilities to customers and are funded by issuing commercial paper to third-party investors. The conduits generally do not purchase assets originated by the Company. The funding of the conduit is facilitated by the liquidity support and credit enhancements provided by the Company and by certain third parties. As administrator to the conduits, the Company is responsible for selecting and structuring of assets purchased or financed by the conduits, making decisions regarding the funding of the conduits, including determining the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued, monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits assets, and facilitating the operations and cash flows of the conduits. In return, the Company earns structuring fees from clients for individual transactions and earns an administration fee from the conduit, which is equal to the income from client program and liquidity fees of the conduit after payment of interest costs and other fees. This administration fee is fairly stable, since most risks and rewards of the underlying assets are passed back to the customers and, once the asset pricing is negotiated, most ongoing income, costs and fees are relatively stable as a percentage of the conduits size. The conduits administered by the Company do not generally invest in liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties. The assets are privately negotiated and structured transactions that are designed to be held by the conduit, rather than actively traded and sold. The yield earned by the conduit on each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper issued by the conduit, thus passing interest rate risk to the client. Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transaction-specific credit enhancement features provided by the third-party seller, including over-collateralization, cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees. These credit enhancements are sized with the objective of approximating a credit rating of A or above, based on the Companys internal risk ratings. Substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of short-term commercial paper. As of December 31, 2008, the weighted average life of the commercial paper issued was approximately 37 days. In addition, the conduits have issued Subordinate Loss Notes and equity with a notional amount of approximately $80 million and varying remaining tenors ranging from six months to seven years. The primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit investors is in the form of transaction-specific credit enhancement described above. In addition, there are two additional forms of credit enhancement that protect the commercial paper investors from defaulting assets. First, the Subordinate Loss Notes issued by each conduit absorb any credit losses up to their full notional amount. It is expected that the Subordinate Loss Notes issued by each conduit are sufficient to absorb a majority of the expected losses from each conduit, thereby making the single investor in the Subordinate Loss Note the primary beneficiary under FIN 46(R). Second, each conduit has obtained a letter of credit from the Company, which is generally 8-10% of the conduits assets. The letters of credit provided by the Company total approximately $5.8 billion and are included in the Companys maximum exposure to loss. The net result across all multi-seller conduits administered by the Company is that, in the event of defaulted assets in excess of the transaction-specific credit enhancement described above, any losses in each conduit are allocated in the following order:  Subordinate loss note holders  the Company  the commercial paper investors The Company, along with third parties, also provides the conduits with two forms of liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding to the conduits in the event of a market disruption, among other events. Each asset of the conduit is supported by a transaction-specific liquidity facility in the form of an asset purchase agreement (APA). Under the APA, the Company has agreed to purchase non-defaulted eligible receivables from the conduit at par. Any assets purchased under the APA are subject to increased pricing. The APA is not designed to provide credit support to the conduit, as it generally does not permit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets and generally reprices the assets purchased to consider potential increased credit risk. The APA covers all assets in the conduits and is considered in the Companys maximum exposure to loss. In addition, the Company provides the conduits with program-wide liquidity in the form of short-term lending commitments. Under these commitments, the Company has agreed to lend to the conduits in the event of a short-term disruption in the commercial paper market, subject to specified conditions. The total notional exposure under the program-wide liquidity agreement is $11.3 billion and is considered in the Companys maximum exposure to loss. The Company receives fees for providing both types of liquidity agreement and considers these fees to be on fair market terms. 183 Table of Contents Finally, the Company is one of several named dealers in the commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a market-based fee for providing such services. Along with third-party dealers, the Company makes a market in the commercial paper and may from time to time fund commercial paper pending sale to a third party. On specific dates with less liquidity in the market, the Company may hold in inventory commercial paper issued by conduits administered by the Company, as well as conduits administered by third parties. The amount of commercial paper issued by its administered conduits held in inventory fluctuates based on market conditions and activity. As of December 31, 2008, the Company owned $57 million of commercial paper issued by its administered conduits. FIN 46(R) requires that the Company quantitatively analyze the expected variability of the conduit to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the conduit. The Company performs this analysis on a quarterly basis and has concluded that the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the conduits as defined in FIN 46(R) and, therefore, does not consolidate the conduits it administers. In conducting this analysis, the Company considers three primary sources of variability in the conduit: credit risk, interest-rate risk and fee variability. The Company models the credit risk of the conduits assets using a Credit Value at Risk (C-VaR) model. The C-VaR model considers changes in credit spreads (both within a rating class as well as due to rating upgrades and downgrades), name-specific changes in credit spreads, credit defaults and recovery rates and diversification effects of pools of financial assets. The model incorporates data from independent rating agencies as well as the Companys own proprietary information regarding spread changes, ratings transitions and losses given default. Using this credit data, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed to develop a distribution of credit risk for the portfolio of assets owned by each conduit, which is then applied on a probability-weighted basis to determine expected losses due to credit risk. In addition, the Company continuously monitors the specific credit characteristics of the conduits assets and the current credit environment to confirm that the C-VaR model used continues to incorporate the Companys best information regarding the expected credit risk of the conduits assets. The Company also analyzes the variability in the fees that it earns from the conduit using monthly actual historical cash flow data to determine average fee and standard deviation measures for each conduit. Because any unhedged interest rate and foreign-currency risk not contractually passed on to customers is absorbed by the fees earned by the Company, the fee variability analysis incorporates those risks. The fee variability and credit risk variability are then combined into a single distribution of the conduits overall returns. This return distribution is updated and analyzed on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the amount of the Subordinate Loss Notes issued to third parties is sufficient to absorb greater than 50% of the total expected variability in the conduits returns. The expected variability absorbed by the Subordinate Loss Note investors is therefore measured to be greater than the expected variability absorbed by the Company through its liquidity arrangements and other fees earned, and the investors in commercial paper and medium-term notes. While the notional amounts of the Subordinate Loss Notes are quantitatively small compared to the size of the conduits, this is reflective of the fact that most of the substantive risks of the conduits are absorbed by the enhancements provided by the sellers and other third parties that provide transaction-level credit enhancement. Because FIN 46(R) requires these risks and related enhancements to be excluded from the analysis, the remaining risks and expected variability are quantitatively small. The calculation of variability under FIN 46(R) focuses primarily on expected variability, rather than the risks associated with extreme outcomes (for example, large levels of default) that are expected to occur very infrequently. So while the Subordinate Loss Notes are sized appropriately compared to expected losses as measured in FIN 46(R), they do not provide significant protection against extreme or unusual credit losses. Third-Party Commercial Paper Conduits The Company also provides liquidity facilities to single- and multi-seller conduits sponsored by third parties. These conduits are independently owned and managed and invest in a variety of asset classes, depending on the nature of the conduit. The facilities provided by the Company typically represent a small portion of the total liquidity facilities obtained by each conduit, and are collateralized by the assets of each conduit. The notional amount of these facilities is approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2008. $2 million was funded under these facilities as of December 31, 2008. Collateralized Debt and Loan Obligations A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is an SPE that purchases a pool of assets consisting of asset-backed securities and synthetic exposures through derivatives on asset-backed securities and issues multiple tranches of equity and notes to investors. A third-party manager is typically retained by the CDO to select the pool of assets and manage those assets over the term of the CDO. The Company earns fees for warehousing assets prior to the creation of a CDO, structuring CDOs and placing debt securities with investors. In addition, the Company has retained interests in many of the CDOs it has structured and makes a market in those issued notes. A cash CDO, or arbitrage CDO, is a CDO designed to take advantage of the difference between the yield on a portfolio of selected assets, typically residential mortgage-backed securities, and the cost of funding the CDO through the sale of notes to investors. Cash flow CDOs are vehicles in which the CDO passes on cash flows from a pool of assets, while market value CDOs pay to investors the market value of the pool of assets owned by the CDO at maturity. Both types of CDOs are typically managed by a third-party asset manager. In these transactions, all of the equity and notes issued by the CDO are funded, as the cash is needed to purchase the debt securities. In a typical cash CDO, a third-party investment manager selects a portfolio of assets, which the Company funds through a warehouse financing arrangement prior to the creation of the CDO. The Company then sells the debt securities to the CDO in exchange for cash raised through the issuance of notes. The Companys continuing involvement in cash CDOs is typically limited to investing in a portion of the notes or loans issued by the CDO and making a market in those securities, and acting as derivative counterparty for interest rate or foreign currency swaps used in the structuring of the CDO. A synthetic CDO is similar to a cash CDO, except that the CDO obtains exposure to all or a portion of the referenced assets synthetically through derivative instruments, such as credit default swaps. Because the CDO does not need to raise cash sufficient to purchase the entire referenced portfolio, a substantial portion of the senior tranches of risk is typically passed on to CDO investors in the form of unfunded liabilities or derivative instruments. Thus, the CDO writes credit protection on select referenced debt securities to the Company or third parties and the risk is then passed on to the CDO investors in the form of funded notes or purchased credit protection through derivative 184 Table of Contents instruments. Any cash raised from investors is invested in a portfolio of collateral securities or investment contracts. The collateral is then used to support the CDOs obligations on the credit default swaps written to counterparties. The Companys continuing involvement in synthetic CDOs generally includes purchasing credit protection through credit default swaps with the CDO, owning a portion of the capital structure of the CDO, in the form of both unfunded derivative positions (primarily super senior exposures discussed below) and funded notes, entering into interest-rate swap and total-return swap transactions with the CDO, lending to the CDO, and making a market in those funded notes. A collateralized loan obligation (CLO) is substantially similar to the CDO transactions described above, except that the assets owned by the SPE (either cash instruments or synthetic exposures through derivative instruments) are corporate loans and to a lesser extent corporate bonds, rather than asset-backed debt securities. Consolidation The Company has retained significant portions of the super senior positions issued by certain CDOs. These positions are referred to as super senior because they represent the most senior positions in the CDO and, at the time of structuring, were senior to tranches rated AAA by independent rating agencies. These positions include facilities structured in the form of short-term commercial paper, where the Company wrote put options (liquidity puts) to certain CDOs. Under the terms of the liquidity puts, if the CDO was unable to issue commercial paper at a rate below a specified maximum (generally LIBOR + 35bps to LIBOR + 40 bps), the Company was obligated to fund the senior tranche of the CDO at a specified interest rate. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had purchased all $25 billion of the commercial paper subject to the liquidity puts. Since inception of many CDO transactions, the subordinate tranches of the CDOs have diminished significantly in value and in rating. The declines in value of the subordinate tranches and in the super senior tranches indicate that the super senior tranches are now exposed to a significant portion of the expected losses of the CDOs, based on current market assumptions. The Company evaluates these transactions for consolidation when reconsideration events occur, as defined in FIN 46(R). Upon a reconsideration event, the Company is at risk for consolidation only if the Company owns a majority of either a single tranche or a group of tranches that absorb the remaining risk of the CDO. Due to reconsideration events during 2007 and 2008, the Company has consolidated 34 of the 46 CDOs/CLOs in which the Company holds a majority of the senior interests of the transaction. The Company continues to monitor its involvement in unconsolidated VIEs and if the Company were to acquire additional interests in these vehicles or if the CDOs contractual arrangements were to be changed to reallocate expected losses or residual returns among the various interest holders, the Company may be required to consolidate the CDOs. For cash CDOs, the net result of such consolidation would be to gross up the Companys balance sheet by the current fair value of the subordinate securities held by third parties, which amounts are not considered material. For synthetic CDOs, the net result of such consolidation may reduce the Companys balance sheet by eliminating intercompany derivative receivables and payables in consolidation.

In millions of dollars CDOs CLOs Carrying value of retained interests $928 $ 763 Discount rates Adverse change of 10% $ (21 ) $ (11 ) Adverse change of 20% (41 ) (23 ) Asset-Based Financing The Company provides loans and other forms of financing to VIEs that hold assets. Those loans are subject to the same credit approvals as all other loans originated or purchased by the Company and related loan loss reserves are reported as part of the Companys Allowance for credit losses in Note 18 on page 165. Financings in the form of debt securities or derivatives are, in most circumstances, reported in Trading account assets and accounted for at fair value through earnings. The primary types of asset-based financing, total assets of the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and the Companys maximum exposure to loss at December 31, 2008 are shown below. For the Company to realize that maximum loss, the VIE (borrower) would have to default with no recovery from the assets held by the VIE.

Those vehicles finance a majority of their asset purchases with commercial paper and short-term notes. Certain of the assets owned by the vehicles have suffered significant declines in fair value, leading to an inability to re-issue maturing commercial paper and short-term notes. Citigroup has been required to provide loans to those vehicles to replace maturing commercial paper and short-term notes, in accordance with the original terms of the backstop liquidity facilities.

The trusts are typically single-issuer trusts whose assets are purchased from the Company and from the secondary market. The trusts issue long-term senior floating rate notes (Floaters) and junior residual securities (Residuals). The Floaters have a long-term rating based on the long-term rating of the underlying municipal bond and a short-term rating based on that of the liquidity provider to the trust. The Residuals are generally rated based on the long-term rating of the underlying municipal bond and entitle the holder to the residual cash flows from the issuing trust. The Company sponsors three kinds of TOB trusts: customer TOB trusts, proprietary TOB trusts and QSPE TOB trusts.  Customer TOB trusts are trusts through which customers finance investments in municipal securities and are not consolidated by the Company. Proprietary and QSPE TOB trusts, on the other hand, provide the Company with the ability to finance its own investments in municipal securities.  Proprietary TOB trusts are generally consolidated, in which case the financing (the Floaters) is recognized on the Companys balance sheet as a liability. However, certain proprietary TOB trusts are not consolidated by the Company, where the Residuals are held by hedge funds that are consolidated and managed by the Company. The assets and the associated liabilities of these TOB trusts are not consolidated by the hedge funds (and, thus, are not consolidated by the Company) under the application of the AICPA Investment Company Audit Guide, which precludes consolidation of owned investments. The Company consolidates the hedge funds, because the Company holds controlling financial interests in the hedge funds. Certain of the Companys equity investments in the hedge funds are hedged with derivatives transactions executed by the Company with third parties referencing the returns of the hedge fund.  QSPE TOB trusts provide the Company with the same exposure as proprietary TOB trusts and are not consolidated by the Company. Credit rating distribution is based on the external rating of the municipal bonds within the TOB trusts, including any credit enhancement provided by monoline insurance companies or the Company in the primary or secondary markets, as discussed below. The total assets for proprietary TOB Trusts (consolidated and non-consolidated) includes $0.9 billion of assets where the Residuals are held by a hedge fund that is consolidated and managed by the Company. The TOB trusts fund the purchase of their assets by issuing Floaters along with Residuals, which are frequently less than 1% of a trusts total funding. The tenor of the Floaters matches the maturity of the TOB trust and is equal to or shorter than the tenor of the municipal bond held by the trust, and the Floaters bear interest rates that are typically reset weekly to a new market rate (based on the SIFMA index). Floater holders have an option to tender the Floaters they hold back to the trust periodically. Customer TOB trusts issue the Floaters and Residuals to third parties. Proprietary and QSPE TOB trusts issue the Floaters to third parties and the Residuals are held by the Company. Approximately $3.9 billion of the municipal bonds owned by TOB trusts have an additional credit guarantee provided by the Company. In all other cases, the assets are either unenhanced or are insured with a monoline insurance provider in the primary market or in the secondary market. While the trusts have not encountered any adverse credit events as defined in the underlying trust agreements, certain monoline insurance companies have experienced downgrades. In these cases, the Company has proactively managed the TOB programs by applying additional secondary market insurance on the assets or proceeding with orderly unwinds of the trusts. The Company, in its capacity as remarketing agent, facilitates the sale of the Floaters to third parties at inception of the trust and facilitates the reset of the Floater coupon and tenders of Floaters. If Floaters are tendered and the Company (in its role as remarketing agent) is unable to find a new investor within a specified period of time, it can declare a failed remarketing (in which case the trust is unwound) or may choose to buy the Floaters into its own inventory and may continue to try to sell it to a third-party investor. While the level of the Companys inventory of Floaters fluctuates, the Company held approximately $1.9 billion of Floater inventory related to the Customer, Proprietary and QSPE TOB programs as of December 31, 2008. If a trust is unwound early due to an event other than a credit event on the underlying municipal bond, the underlying municipal bond is sold in the secondary market. If there is an accompanying shortfall in the trusts cash flows to fund the redemption of the Floaters after the sale of the underlying municipal bond, the trust draws on a liquidity agreement in an amount equal to the shortfall. Liquidity agreements are generally provided to the trust directly by the Company. For customer TOBs where the Residual is less than 25% of the trusts capital structure, the Company has a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder under which the Residual holder reimburses the Company for any payment made under the liquidity arrangement. Through this reimbursement agreement, the Residual holder remains economically exposed to fluctuations in value of the municipal bond. These reimbursement agreements are actively margined based on changes in value of the underlying municipal bond to mitigate the Companys counterparty credit risk. In cases where a third party provides liquidity to a proprietary or QSPE TOB trust, a similar reimbursement arrangement is made whereby the Company (or a consolidated subsidiary of the Company) as Residual holder absorbs any losses incurred by the liquidity provider. As of December 31, 2008, liquidity agreements provided with respect to customer TOB trusts totaled $7.1 billion, offset by reimbursement agreements in place with a notional amount of $5.5 billion. The remaining exposure relates to TOB transactions where the Residual owned by the customer is at least 25% of the bond value at the inception of the transaction. In addition, the Company has provided liquidity arrangements with a notional amount of $6.5 billion to QSPE TOB trusts and other non-consolidated proprietary TOB trusts described above. The Company considers the customer and proprietary TOB trusts (excluding QSPE TOB trusts) to be variable interest entities within the scope of FIN 46(R). Because third-party investors hold the Residual and Floater interests in the customer TOB trusts, the Companys involvement and variable interests include only its role as remarketing agent and liquidity provider. On the basis of the variability absorbed by the customer through the reimbursement arrangement or significant residual investment, the Company does not consolidate the Customer TOB trusts. The Companys variable interests in the Proprietary TOB trusts include the Residual as well as the remarking and liquidity agreements with the trusts. On the basis of the variability absorbed through these contracts (primarily the Residual), the Company generally consolidates the Proprietary TOB trusts. Finally, certain proprietary TOB trusts and QSPE TOB trusts are not consolidated by 186 Table of Contents application of specific accounting literature. For the nonconsolidated proprietary TOB trusts and QSPE TOB trusts, the Company recognizes only its residual investment on its balance sheet at fair value and the third-party financing raised by the trusts is off-balance sheet. The following table summarizes selected cash flow information related to municipal bond securitizations for the years 2008, 2007 and 2006: In billions of dollars 2008 2007 2006 Proceeds from new securitizations $ 1.2 $ 10.5  Cash flows received on retained interests and other net cash flows 0.5   Municipal Investments Municipal investment transactions represent partnerships that finance the construction and rehabilitation of low-income affordable rental housing. The Company generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits earned from the affordable housing investments made by the partnership. Client Intermediation Client intermediation transactions represent a range of transactions designed to provide investors with specified returns based on the returns of an underlying security, referenced asset or index. These transactions include credit-linked notes and equity-linked notes. In these transactions, the SPE typically obtains exposure to the underlying security, referenced asset or index through a derivative instrument, such as a total-return swap or a credit-default swap. In turn the SPE issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the specified underlying security, referenced asset or index. The SPE invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed insurance contract (GIC) that serves as collateral for the derivative contract over the term of the transaction. The Companys involvement in these transactions includes being the counterparty to the SPEs derivative instruments and investing in a portion of the notes issued by the SPE. In certain transactions, the investors maximum risk of loss is limited and the Company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level. The Companys maximum risk of loss in these transactions is defined as the amount invested in notes issued by the SPE and the notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by the Company through a separate instrument issued by the SPE. The derivative instrument held by the Company may generate a receivable from the SPE (for example, where the Company purchases credit protection from the SPE in connection with the SPEs issuance of a credit-linked note), which is collateralized by the assets owned by the SPE. These derivative instruments are not considered variable interests under FIN 46(R) and any associated receivables are not included in the calculation of maximum exposure to the SPE. Structured Investment Vehicles Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) are SPEs that issue junior notes and senior debt (medium-term notes and short-term commercial paper) to fund the purchase of high quality assets. The junior notes are subject to the first loss risk of the SIVs. The SIVs provide a variable return to the junior note investors based on the net spread between the cost to issue the senior debt and the return realized by the high quality assets. The Company acts as manager for the SIVs and, prior to December 13, 2007, was not contractually obligated to provide liquidity facilities or guarantees to the SIVs. In response to the ratings review of the outstanding senior debt of the SIVs for a possible downgrade announced by two ratings agencies and the continued reduction of liquidity in the SIV-related asset-backed commercial paper and medium-term note markets, on December 13, 2007, Citigroup announced its commitment to provide support facilities that would support the SIVs senior debt ratings. As a result of this commitment, Citigroup became the SIVs primary beneficiary and began consolidating these entities. On February 12, 2008, Citigroup finalized the terms of the support facilities, which took the form of a commitment to provide $3.5 billion of mezzanine capital to the SIVs in the event the market value of their junior notes approaches zero. The mezzanine capital facility was increased by $1 billion to $4.5 billion, with the additional commitment funded during the fourth quarter of 2008. The facilities rank senior to the junior notes but junior to the commercial paper and medium-term notes. The facilities were at arms-length terms. Interest was paid on the drawn amount of the facilities and a per annum fee was paid on the unused portion. During the period to November 18, 2008, the Company wrote down $3.3 billion on SIV assets. In order to complete the wind-down of the SIVs, the Company, in a nearly cashless transaction, purchased the remaining assets of the SIVs at fair value, with a trade date of November 18, 2008. The Company funded the purchase of the SIV assets by assuming the obligation to pay amounts due under the medium-term notes issued by the SIVs, as the medium-term notes mature. The net funding provided by the Company to fund the purchase of the SIV assets was $0.3 billion. As of December 31, 2008, the carrying amount of the purchased SIV assets was $16.6 billion, of which $16.5 billion is classified as HTM assets. Investment Funds The Company is the investment manager for certain investment funds that invest in various asset classes including private equity, hedge funds, real estate, fixed income and infrastructure. The Company earns a management fee, which is a percentage of capital under management, and may earn performance fees. In addition, for some of these funds the Company has an ownership interest in the investment funds. The Company has also established a number of investment funds as opportunities for qualified employees to invest in private equity investments. The Company acts as investment manager to these funds and may provide employees with financing on both a recourse and non-recourse basis for a portion of the employees investment commitments. 187 Table of Contents Trust Preferred Securities The Company has raised financing through the issuance of trust preferred securities. In these transactions, the Company forms a statutory business trust and owns all of the voting equity shares of the trust. The trust issues preferred equity securities to third-party investors and invests the gross proceeds in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by the Company. These trusts have no assets, operations, revenues or cash flows other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the preferred equity securities held by third-party investors. These trusts obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. Because the sole asset of the trust is a receivable from the Company, the Company is not permitted to consolidate the trusts under FIN 46(R), even though the Company owns all of the voting equity shares of the trust, has fully guaranteed the trusts obligations, and has the right to redeem the preferred securities in certain circumstances. The Company recognizes the subordinated debentures on its balance sheet as long-term liabilities. 188 Table of Contents 24. DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions. These derivative transactions include:  Futures and forward contracts which are commitments to buy or sell at a future date a financial instrument, commodity or currency at a contracted price and may be settled in cash or through delivery.  Swap contracts which are commitments to settle in cash at a future date or dates that may range from a few days to a number of years, based on differentials between specified financial indices, as applied to a notional principal amount.  Option contracts which give the purchaser, for a fee, the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell within a limited time a financial instrument, commodity or currency at a contracted price that may also be settled in cash, based on differentials between specified indices or prices. Citigroup enters into these derivative contracts for the following reasons:  Trading PurposesCustomer Needs  Citigroup offers its customers derivatives in connection with their risk-management actions to transfer, modify or reduce their interest rate, foreign exchange and other market/credit risks or for their own trading purposes. As part of this process, Citigroup considers the customers suitability for the risk involved, and the business purpose for the transaction. Citigroup also manages its derivative-risk positions through offsetting trade activities, controls focused on price verification, and daily reporting of positions to senior managers.  Trading PurposesOwn Account  Citigroup trades derivatives for its own account. Trading limits and price verification controls are key aspects of this activity.  Asset/Liability Management HedgingCitigroup uses derivatives in connection with its risk-management activities to hedge certain risks or reposition the risk profile of the Company. For example, Citigroup may issue fixed-rate long-term debt and then enter into a receive-fixed, pay-variable-rate interest rate swap with the same tenor and notional amount to convert the interest payments to a net variable-rate basis. This strategy is the most common form of an interest rate hedge, as it minimizes interest cost in certain yield curve environments. Derivatives are also used to manage risks inherent in specific groups of on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, including investments, corporate and consumer loans, deposit liabilities, as well as other interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. In addition, foreign- exchange contracts are used to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated debt, available-for-sale securities, net capital exposures and foreign-exchange transactions. Derivatives may expose Citigroup to market, credit or liquidity risks in excess of the amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Market risk on a derivative product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations in interest rates, foreign-exchange rates and other values and is a function of the type of product, the volume of transactions, the tenor and terms of the agreement, and the underlying volatility. Credit risk is the exposure to loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the transaction where the value of any collateral held is not adequate to cover such losses. The recognition in earnings of unrealized gains on these transactions is subject to managements assessment as to collectibility. Liquidity risk is the potential exposure that arises when the size of the derivative position may not be able to be rapidly adjusted in periods of high volatility and financial stress at a reasonable cost. Accounting for Derivative Hedging Citigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance with SFAS 133. As a general rule, SFAS 133 hedge accounting is permitted for those situations where the Company is exposed to a particular risk, such as interest-rate or foreign-exchange risk, that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or liability, or variability in the expected future cash flows of an existing asset, liability or a forecasted transaction that may affect earnings. Derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with the changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges, while contracts hedging the risks affecting the expected future cash flows are called cash flow hedges. Hedges that utilize derivatives or debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with equity investments in non-U.S. dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries (net investment in a foreign operation) are called net investment hedges. All derivatives are reported on the balance sheet at fair value. In addition, where applicable, all such contracts covered by master netting agreements are reported net. Gross positive fair values are netted with gross negative fair values by counterparty pursuant to a valid master netting agreement. In addition, payables and receivables in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given counterparty are included in this netting. However, non-cash collateral is not included. As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the amount of payables in respect of cash collateral received that was netted with unrealized gains from derivatives was $52 billion and $26 billion, respectively, while the amount of receivables in respect of cash collateral paid that was netted with unrealized losses from derivatives was $58 billion and $37 billion, respectively. If certain hedging criteria specified in SFAS 133 are met, including testing for hedge effectiveness, special hedge accounting may be applied. The hedge-effectiveness assessment methodologies for similar hedges are performed in a similar manner and are used consistently throughout the hedging relationships. For fair value hedges, the changes in value of the hedging derivative, as well as the changes in value of the related hedged item, due to the risk being hedged, are reflected in current earnings. For cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, the changes in value of the hedging derivative are reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Stockholders equity, to the extent the hedge was effective. Hedge ineffectiveness, in either case, is reflected in current earnings. For asset/liability management hedging, the fixed-rate long-term debt may be recorded at amortized cost under current U.S. GAAP. However, by electing to use SFAS 133 hedge accounting, the carrying value of the debt is adjusted for changes in the benchmark interest rate, with any such changes in value recorded in current earnings. The related interest-rate swap is also recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with any changes in fair value reflected in earnings. Thus, any ineffectiveness resulting from the hedging relationship is recorded in current earnings. Alternatively, an economic hedge, which does not meet the SFAS 133 hedging criteria, would involve only recording the derivative at fair value on the balance sheet, with its associated changes in fair value recorded in earnings. The debt would continue to be carried at amortized cost and, therefore, current earnings would be impacted only by the interest rate shifts that cause the change in 189 Table of Contents the swaps value and the underlying yield of the debt. This type of hedge is undertaken when SFAS 133 hedge requirements cannot be achieved or management decides not to apply SFAS 133 hedge accounting. Another alternative for the Company would be to elect to carry the note at fair value under SFAS 159. Once the irrevocable election is made upon issuance of the note, the full change in fair value of the note would be reported in earnings. The related interest rate swap, with changes in fair value also reflected in earnings, provides a natural offset to the notes fair value change. To the extent the two offsets would not be exactly equal, the difference would be reflected in current earnings. This type of economic hedge is undertaken when the Company prefers to follow this simpler method that achieves similar financial statement results to an SFAS 133 fair-value hedge. Fair value hedges  Hedging of benchmark interest rate riskCitigroup hedges exposure to changes in the fair value of outstanding fixed-rate issued debt and borrowings. The fixed cash flows from those financing transactions are converted to benchmark variable-rate cash flows by entering into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. These fair-value hedge relationships use dollar-offset ratio analysis to determine whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis. Citigroup also hedges exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate assets, including available-for-sale debt securities and loans. The hedging instruments used are receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps. Most of these fair-value hedging relationships use dollar-offset ratio analysis to determine whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis, while certain others use regression analysis.  Hedging of foreign exchange riskCitigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to foreign-exchange rate movements in available-for-sale securities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding the securities, which may be within or outside the U.S. Typically, the hedging instrument employed is a forward foreign-exchange contract. In this type of hedge, the change in fair value of the hedged available-for-sale security attributable to the portion of foreign exchange risk hedged is reported in earnings and not Accumulated other comprehensive incomea process that serves to offset substantially the change in fair value of the forward contract that is also reflected in earnings. Citigroup typically considers the premium associated with forward contracts (differential between spot and contractual forward rates) as the cost of hedging; this is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and reflected directly in earnings. Dollar-offset method is typically used to assess hedge effectiveness. Since that assessment is based on changes in fair value attributable to changes in spot rates on both the available-for-sale securities and the forward contracts for the portion of the relationship hedged, the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant. Cash flow hedges  Hedging of benchmark interest rate riskCitigroup hedges variable cash flows resulting from floating-rate liabilities and roll over (re-issuance) of short-term liabilities. Variable cash flows from those liabilities are converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest-rate swaps and receive-variable, pay-fixed forward-starting interest-rate swaps. For some hedges, the hedge ineffectiveness is eliminated by matching all terms of the hedged item and the hedging derivative at inception and on an ongoing basis. Citigroup does not exclude any terms from consideration when applying the matched terms method. To the extent all terms are not perfectly matched, these cash-flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis. Since efforts are made to match the terms of the derivatives to those of the hedged forecasted cash flows as closely as possible, the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant even when the terms do not match perfectly. Citigroup also hedges variable cash flows resulting from investments in floating-rate, available-for-sale debt securities. Variable cash flows from those assets are converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest-rate swaps. These cash-flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis. Since efforts are made to align the terms of the derivatives to those of the hedged forecasted cash flows as closely as possible, the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant.  Hedging of foreign exchange riskCitigroup locks in the functional currency equivalent of cash flows of various balance sheet liability exposures, including deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt (and the forecasted issuances or rollover of such items) that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the issuing entity. Depending on the risk-management objectives, these types of hedges are designated as either cash-flow hedges of only foreign-exchange risk or cash-flow hedges of both foreign-exchange and interest-rate risk, and the hedging instruments used are foreign-exchange forward contracts, cross-currency swaps and foreign-currency options. For some hedges, Citigroup matches all terms of the hedged item and the hedging derivative at inception and on an ongoing basis to eliminate hedge ineffectiveness. Citigroup does not exclude any terms from consideration when applying the matched terms method. To the extent all terms are not perfectly matched, any ineffectiveness is measured using the hypothetical derivative method from FASB Derivative Implementation Group Issue G7. Efforts are made to match up the terms of the hypothetical and actual derivatives used as closely as possible. As a result, the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant even when the terms do not match perfectly. Net investment hedges Consistent with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation (SFAS 52), SFAS 133 allows hedging of the foreign-currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation. Citigroup uses foreign-currency forwards, options and swaps and foreign-currency-denominated debt instruments to manage the foreign-exchange risk associated with Citigroups equity investments in several non-U.S. dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. In accordance with SFAS 52, Citigroup records the change in the carrying amount of these investments in the cumulative translation adjustment account within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Simultaneously, the effective portion of the hedge of this exposure is also 190 Table of Contents recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account and the ineffective portion, if any, is immediately recorded in earnings. For derivatives used in net investment hedges, Citigroup follows the forward-rate method from FASB Derivative Implementation Group Issue H8. According to that method, all changes in fair value, including changes related to the forward-rate component of the foreign-currency forward contracts and the time-value of foreign-currency options, are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account. For foreign-currency-denominated debt instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments, the translation gain or loss that is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account is based on the spot exchange rate between the functional currency of the respective subsidiary and the U.S. dollar, which is the functional currency of Citigroup. To the extent the notional amount of the hedging instrument exactly matches the hedged net investment and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument relates to the exchange rate between the functional currency of the net investment and Citigroups functional currency (or, in the case of the non-derivative debt instrument, such instrument is denominated in the functional currency of the net investment), no ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings. Hedge effectiveness Key aspects of achieving SFAS 133 hedge accounting are documentation of hedging strategy and hedge effectiveness at the hedge inception and substantiating hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis. A derivative must be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being hedged. Any ineffectiveness in the hedge relationship is recognized in current earnings. The assessment of effectiveness excludes changes in the value of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged. Similarly, the assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the fair value of a derivative related to time value that, if excluded, are recognized in current earnings. The following table summarizes certain information related to the Companys hedging activities for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: In millions of dollars 2008 2007 2006 Fair value hedges Hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings $ (559 ) $ 91 $ 245 Net gain excluded from assessment of effectiveness 178 420 302 Cash flow hedges Hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings (27 )  (18 ) Net gain (loss) excluded from assessment of effectiveness (17 )   Net investment hedges Net gain (loss) included in foreign currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income $2,811 $ (1,051 ) $ (569 ) For cash flow hedges, any changes in the fair value of the end-user derivative remaining in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet will be included in earnings of future periods to offset the variability of the hedged cash flows when such cash flows affect earnings. The net loss associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income within 12 months of December 31, 2008 is approximately $1.9 billion. The change in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from cash flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 can be summarized as follows (after-tax): In millions of dollars 2008 2007 2006 Beginning balance $ (3,163 ) $ (61 ) $ 612 Net gain (loss) from cash flow hedges (2,738 ) (2,932 ) (29 ) Net amounts reclassified to earnings 712 (170 ) (644 ) Ending balance $ (5,189 ) $ (3,163 ) $ (61 ) 191 Table of Contents 25. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to Citigroups total credit exposure. Although Citigroups portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified along industry, product, and geographic lines, material transactions are completed with other financial institutions, particularly in the securities trading, derivatives, and foreign exchange businesses. In connection with the Companys efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio, the Company limits its exposure to any one geographic region, country or individual creditor and monitors this exposure on a continuous basis. At December 31, 2008, Citigroups most significant concentration of credit risk was with the U.S. government and its agencies. The Companys exposure, which primarily results from trading assets and investments issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, amounted to $93.7 billion and $73.8 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. After the U.S. government, the Companys next largest exposures are to the Mexican and Japanese governments and their agencies, which are rated investment grade by both Moodys and S&P. The Companys exposure to Mexico amounted to $35.0 billion and $32.0 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and is composed of investment securities, loans and trading assets. The Companys exposure to Japan amounted to $29.1 billion and $26.1 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and is composed of investment securities, loans and trading assets. 26. FAIR-VALUE MEASUREMENT (SFAS 157) Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair-value measurements. SFAS 157, among other things, requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. In addition, SFAS 157 precludes the use of block discounts when measuring the fair value of instruments traded in an active market, which discounts were previously applied to large holdings of publicly traded equity securities. It also requires recognition of trade-date gains related to certain derivative transactions whose fair value has been determined using unobservable market inputs. This guidance supersedes the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF Issue 02-3), which prohibited the recognition of trade-date gains for such derivative transactions when determining the fair value of instruments not traded in an active market. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 157, the Company has made some amendments to the techniques used in measuring the fair value of derivative and other positions. These amendments change the way that the probability of default of a counterparty is factored into the valuation of derivative positions, include for the first time the impact of Citigroups own credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at fair value, and also eliminate the portfolio servicing adjustment that is no longer necessary under SFAS 157. Fair-Value Hierarchy SFAS 157 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Companys market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair-value hierarchy:  Level 1Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.  Level 2Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.  Level 3Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. The Company considers relevant and observable market prices in its valuations where possible. The frequency of transactions, the size of the bid-ask spread and the amount of adjustment necessary when comparing similar transactions are all factors in determining the liquidity of markets and the relevance of observed prices in those markets. Determination of Fair Value For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, the Company measures such value using the procedures set out below, irrespective of whether these assets and liabilities are carried at fair value as a result of an election under SFAS 159, FASB Statement No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments (SFAS 155), or FASB Statement No. 156, Accounting 192 Table of Contents for Servicing of Financial Assets (SFAS 156), or whether they were previously carried at fair value. When available, the Company generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items in Level 1. In some cases where a market price is available, the Company will make use of acceptable practical expedients (such as matrix pricing) to calculate fair value, in which case the items are classified in Level 2. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates, option volatilities, etc. Items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable. Where available, the Company may also make use of quoted prices for recent trading activity in positions with the same or similar characteristics to that being valued. The frequency and size of transactions and the amount of the bid-ask spread are among the factors considered in determining the liquidity of markets and the relevance of observed prices from those markets. If relevant and observable prices are available, those valuations would be classified as Level 2. If prices are not available, other valuation techniques would be used and the item would be classified as Level 3. Fair-value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified, where possible, to prices obtained from independent vendors or brokers. Vendors and brokers valuations may be based on a variety of inputs ranging from observed prices to proprietary valuation models. The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure various financial instruments at fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair-value hierarchy in which each instrument is generally classified. Where appropriate, the description includes details of the valuation models, the key inputs to those models as well as any significant assumptions. Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase No quoted prices exist for such instruments and so fair value is determined using a discounted cash-flow technique. Cash flows are estimated based on the terms of the contract, taking into account any embedded derivative or other features. Expected cash flows are discounted using market rates appropriate to the maturity of the instrument as well as the nature and amount of collateral taken or received. Generally, such instruments are classified within Level 2 of the fair-value hierarchy as the inputs used in the fair valuation are readily observable. Trading Account Assets and LiabilitiesTrading Securities and Trading Loans When available, the Company uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value of trading securities; such items are classified in Level 1 of the fair-value hierarchy. Examples include some government securities and exchange-traded equity securities. For bonds and secondary market loans traded over the counter, the Company generally determines fair value utilizing internal valuation techniques. Fair-value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified, where possible, to prices obtained from independent vendors. Vendors compile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing for similar bonds or loans where no price is observable. If available, the Company may also use quoted prices for recent trading activity of assets with similar characteristics to the bond or loan being valued. Trading securities and loans priced using such methods are generally classified as Level 2. However, when less liquidity exists for a security or loan, a quoted price is stale or prices from independent sources vary, a loan or security is generally classified as Level 3. Where the Companys principal market for a portfolio of loans is the securitization market, the Company uses the securitization price to determine the fair value of the portfolio. The securitization price is determined from the assumed proceeds of a hypothetical securitization in the current market, adjusted for transformation costs (i.e., direct costs other than transaction costs) and securitization uncertainties such as market conditions and liquidity. As a result of the severe reduction in the level of activity in certain securitization markets since the second half of 2007, observable securitization prices for certain directly comparable portfolios of loans have not been readily available. Therefore, such portfolios of loans are generally classified in Level 3 of the fair-value hierarchy. However, for other loan securitization markets, such as those related to conforming prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate mortgage loans, pricing verification of the hypothetical securitizations has been possible, since these markets have remained active. Accordingly, these loan portfolios are classified as Level 2 in the fair-value hierarchy. Trading Account Assets and LiabilitiesDerivatives Exchange-traded derivatives are generally fair valued using quoted market (i.e., exchange) prices and so are classified in Level 1 of the fair-value hierarchy. The majority of derivatives entered into by the Company are executed over the counter and so are valued using internal valuation techniques as no quoted market prices exist for such instruments. The valuation techniques and inputs depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument. The principal techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash flows, Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation. The fair values of derivative contracts reflect cash the Company has paid or received (for example, option premiums paid and received). The key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate yield curves, foreign-exchange rates, the spot price of the underlying volatility and correlation. The item is placed in either Level 2 or Level 3 depending on the observability of the significant inputs to the model. Correlation and items with longer tenors are generally less observable. Subprime-Related Direct Exposures in CDOs The Company accounts for its CDO super senior subprime direct exposures and the underlying securities on a fair-value basis with all changes in fair value recorded in earnings. Citigroups CDO super senior subprime direct exposures are not subject to valuation based on observable transactions. Accordingly, the fair value of these exposures is based on managements best estimates based on facts and circumstances as of the date of these Consolidated Financial Statements. Citigroups CDO super senior subprime direct exposures are Level 3 assets and are subject to valuation based on significant unobservable inputs. Fair 193 Table of Contents value of these exposures (other than high grade and mezzanine as described below) is based on estimates of future cash flows from the mortgage loans underlying the assets of the ABS CDOs. To determine the performance of the underlying mortgage loan portfolios, the Company estimates the prepayments, defaults and loss severities based on a number of macroeconomic factors, including housing price changes, unemployment rates, interest rates and borrower and loan attributes, such as age, credit scores, documentation status, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. The model is calibrated using available mortgage loan information including historical loan performance. In addition, the methodology estimates the impact of geographic concentration of mortgages and the impact of reported fraud in the origination of subprime mortgages. An appropriate discount rate is then applied to the cash flows generated for each ABCP and CDO-squared tranche, in order to estimate its current fair value. When necessary, the valuation methodology used by Citigroup is refined and the inputs used for the purposes of estimation are modified, in part, to reflect ongoing market developments. More specifically, the inputs of home price appreciation (HPA) assumptions and delinquency data were updated during the fourth quarter along with discount rates that are based upon a weighted average combination of implied spreads from single name ABS bond prices and ABX indices, as well as CLO spreads. Beginning with the third quarter of 2008, the Company used the Loan Performance Index to estimate the impact of housing price changes. Previously, it incorporated the S&P/Case-Shiller Index. This change was made because the Loan Performance Index provided more comprehensive geographic data. In addition, the Companys mortgage default model uses recent mortgage performance data, a period of sharp home price declines and high levels of mortgage foreclosures. The valuation as of December 31, 2008 assumes a cumulative decline in U.S. housing prices from peak to trough of 33%. This rate assumes declines of 16% and 13% in 2008 and 2009, respectively, the remainder of the 33% decline having already occurred before the end of 2007. In addition, during the last three quarters of 2008, the discount rates were based on a weighted average combination of the implied spreads from single name ABS bond prices, ABX indices and CLO spreads, depending on vintage and asset types. To determine the discount margin, the Company applies the mortgage default model to the bonds underlying the ABX indices and other referenced cash bonds and solves for the discount margin that produces the market prices of those instruments. Starting in the third quarter of 2008, the valuation of the high grade and mezzanine ABS CDO positions was changed from model valuation to trader prices based on the underlying assets of each high grade and mezzanine ABS CDO. Unlike the ABCP and CDO-squared positions, the high grade and mezzanine positions are now largely hedged through the ABX and bond short positions, which are, by necessity, trader priced. Thus, this change brings closer symmetry in the way these long and short positions are valued by the Company. Citigroup intends to use trader marks to value this portion of the portfolio going forward so long as it remains largely hedged. The primary drivers that currently impact the super senior valuations are the discount rates used to calculate the present value of projected cash flows and projected mortgage loan performance. Given the above, the Companys CDO super senior subprime direct exposures were classified in Level 3 of the fair-value hierarchy. For most of the lending and structuring direct subprime exposures (excluding super seniors), fair value is determined utilizing observable transactions where available, other market data for similar assets in markets that are not active and other internal valuation techniques. Investments The investments category includes available-for-sale debt and marketable equity securities, whose fair value is determined using the same procedures described for trading securities above or, in some cases, using vendor prices as the primary source. Also included in investments are nonpublic investments in private equity and real estate entities held by the S&B business. Determining the fair value of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of management resources and judgment as no quoted prices exist and such securities are generally very thinly traded. In addition, there may be transfer restrictions on private equity securities. The Company uses an established process for determining the fair value of such securities, using commonly accepted valuation techniques, including the use of earnings multiples based on comparable public securities, industry-specific non-earnings-based multiples and discounted cash flow models. In determining the fair value of nonpublic securities, the Company also considers events such as a proposed sale of the investee company, initial public offerings, equity issuances, or other observable transactions. Private equity securities are generally classified in Level 3 of the fair-value hierarchy. Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt Where fair-value accounting has been elected, the fair value of non-structured liabilities is determined by discounting expected cash flows using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity. Such instruments are generally classified in Level 2 of the fair-value hierarchy as all inputs are readily observable. The Company determines the fair value of structured liabilities (where performance is linked to structured interest rates, inflation or currency risks) and hybrid financial instruments (performance linked to risks other than interest rates, inflation or currency risks) using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology (described above) given the nature of the embedded risk profile. Such instruments are classified in Level 2 or Level 3 depending on the observability of significant inputs to the model. Market Valuation Adjustments Liquidity adjustments are applied to items in Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair-value hierarchy to ensure that the fair value reflects the price at which the entire position could be liquidated. The liquidity reserve is based on the bid-offer spread for an instrument, adjusted to take into account the size of the position. Counterparty credit-risk adjustments are applied to derivatives, such as over-the-counter derivatives, where the base valuation uses market parameters based on the LIBOR interest rate curves. Not all counterparties have the same credit risk as that implied by the relevant LIBOR curve, so it is necessary to consider the market view of the credit risk of a counterparty in order to estimate the fair value of such an item. Bilateral or own credit-risk adjustments are applied to reflect the Companys own credit risk when valuing derivatives and liabilities measured at fair value, in accordance with the requirements of SFAS 157. 194 Table of Contents Counterparty and own credit adjustments consider the estimated future cash flows between Citi and its counterparties under the terms of the instrument and the effect of credit risk on the valuation of those cash flows, rather than a point-in-time assessment of the current recognized net asset or liability. Furthermore, the credit-risk adjustments take into account the effect of credit-risk mitigants, such as pledged collateral and any legal right of offset (to the extent such offset exists) with a counterparty through arrangements such as netting agreements. Auction Rate Securities Auction rate securities (ARS) are long-term municipal bonds, corporate bonds, securitizations and preferred stocks with interest rates or dividend yields that are reset through periodic auctions. The coupon paid in the current period is based on the rate determined by the prior auction. In the event of an auction failure, ARS holders receive a fail rate coupon, which is specified by the original issue documentation of each ARS. Where insufficient orders to purchase all of the ARS issue to be sold in an auction were received, the primary dealer or auction agent would traditionally have purchased any residual unsold inventory (without a contractual obligation to do so). This residual inventory would then be repaid through subsequent auctions, typically in a short timeframe. Due to this auction mechanism and generally liquid market, ARS have historically traded and were valued as short-term instruments. Citigroup acted in the capacity of primary dealer for approximately $72 billion of ARS and continued to purchase residual unsold inventory in support of the auction mechanism until mid-February 2008. After this date, liquidity in the ARS market deteriorated significantly, auctions failed due to a lack of bids from third-party investors, and Citigroup ceased to purchase unsold inventory. Following a number of ARS refinancings, at December 31, 2008, Citigroup continued to act in the capacity of primary dealer for approximately $37 billion of outstanding ARS. The Company classifies its ARS as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale and trading securities. Prior to our first auctions failing in the first quarter of 2008, Citigroup valued ARS based on observation of auction market prices, because the auctions had a short maturity period (7, 28 and 35 days). This generally resulted in valuations at par. Once the auctions failed, ARS could no longer be valued using observation of auction market prices. Accordingly, the fair value of ARS is currently estimated using internally developed discounted cash flow valuation techniques specific to the nature of the assets underlying each ARS. For ARS with U.S. municipal securities as underlying assets, future cash flows are estimated based on the terms of the securities underlying each individual ARS and discounted at an estimated discount rate in order to estimate the current fair value. The key assumptions that impact the ARS valuations are estimated prepayments and refinancings, estimated fail rate coupons (i.e., the rate paid in the event of auction failure, which varies according to the current credit rating of the issuer) and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of projected cash flows. The discount rate used for each ARS is based on rates observed for straight issuances of other municipal securities. In order to arrive at the appropriate discount rate, these observed rates were adjusted upward to factor in the specifics of the ARS structure being valued, such as callability, and the illiquidity in the ARS market. For ARS with student loans as underlying assets, future cash flows are estimated based on the terms of the loans underlying each individual ARS, discounted at an appropriate rate in order to estimate the current fair value. The key assumptions that impact the ARS valuations are the expected weighted average life of the structure, estimated fail rate coupons, the amount of leverage in each structure and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of projected cash flows. The discount rate used for each ARS is based on rates observed for basic securitizations with similar maturities to the loans underlying each ARS being valued. In order to arrive at the appropriate discount rate, these observed rates were adjusted upward to factor in the specifics of the ARS structure being valued, such as callability, and the illiquidity in the ARS market. During the first quarter of 2008, ARS for which the auctions failed and where no secondary market has developed were moved to Level 3, as the assets were subject to valuation using significant unobservable inputs. For ARS which are subject to SFAS 157 classification, the majority continue to be classified in Level 3. Alt-A Mortgage Securities The Company classifies its Alt-A mortgage securities as Held-to-Maturity, Available-for-Sale, and Trading investments. The securities classified as trading and available-for-Sale are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reported in current earnings and OCI, respectively. For these purposes, Alt-A mortgage securities are non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) where (1) the underlying collateral has weighted average FICO scores between 680 and 720 or (2) for instances where FICO scores are greater than 720, RMBS have 30% or less of the underlying collateral composed of full documentation loans. Similar to the valuation methodologies used for other trading securities and trading loans, the Company generally determines the fair value of Alt-A mortgage securities utilizing internal valuation techniques. Fair-value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified, where possible, to prices obtained from independent vendors. Vendors compile prices from various sources. Where available, the Company may also make use of quoted prices for recent trading activity in securities with the same or similar characteristics to that being valued. The internal valuation techniques used for Alt-A mortgage securities, as with other mortgage exposures, consider estimated housing price changes, unemployment rates, interest rates and borrower attributes. They also consider prepayment rates as well as other market indicators. Alt-A mortgage securities that are valued using these methods are generally classified as Level 2. However, Alt-A mortgage securities backed by Alt-A mortgages of lower quality or more recent vintages are mostly classified in Level 3 due to the reduced liquidity that exists for such positions, which reduces the reliability of prices available from independent sources. 195 Table of Contents Commercial Real Estate Exposure Citigroup reports a number of different exposures linked to commercial real estate at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, including securities, loans and investments in entities that hold commercial real estate loans or commercial real estate directly. The Company also reports securities backed by commercial real estate as Available-for-sale investments, which are carried at fair value with changes in fair-value reported in AOCI. Similar to the valuation methodologies used for other trading securities and trading loans, the Company generally determines the fair value of securities and loans linked to commercial real estate utilizing internal valuation techniques. Fair-value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified, where possible, to prices obtained from independent vendors. Vendors compile prices from various sources. Where available, the Company may also make use of quoted prices for recent trading activity in securities or loans with the same or similar characteristics to that being valued. Securities and loans linked to commercial real estate valued using these methodologies are generally classified as Level 3 as a result of the reduced liquidity currently in the market for such exposures. The fair value of investments in entities that hold commercial real estate loans or commercial real estate directly is determined using a similar methodology to that used for other non-public investments in real estate held by the S&B business. The Company uses an established process for determining the fair value of such securities, using commonly accepted valuation techniques, including the use of earnings multiples based on comparable public securities, industry-specific non-earnings-based multiples and discounted cash flow models. In determining the fair value of such investments, the Company also considers events, such as a proposed sale of the investee company, initial public offerings, equity issuances, or other observable transactions. Such investments are generally classified in Level 3 of the fair-value hierarchy. Highly Leveraged Financing Commitments The Company reports a number of highly leveraged loans as held for sale, which are measured on a LOCOM basis. The fair value of such exposures is determined, where possible, using quoted secondary-market prices and classified in Level 2 of the fair-value hierarchy if there is a sufficient level of activity in the market and quotes or traded prices are available with suitable frequency. However, due to the dislocation of the credit markets and the reduced market interest in higher risk/higher yield instruments since the latter half of 2007, liquidity in the market for highly leveraged financings has been limited. Therefore, a majority of such exposures are classified in Level 3 as quoted secondary market prices do not generally exist. The fair value for such exposures is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets, adjusted for the specific attributes of the loan being valued. 196 Table of Contents Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following tables present for each of the fair-value hierarchy levels the Companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. The Company often hedges positions that have been classified in the Level 3 category with financial instruments that have been classified as Level 1 or Level 2. In addition, the Company also hedges items classified in the Level 3 category with instruments classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The effects of these hedges are presented gross in the following table.

(2) There is no allowance for loan losses recorded for loans reported at fair value. Changes in Level 3 Fair-Value Category The following tables present the changes in the Level 3 fair-value category for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. The Company classifies financial instruments in Level 3 of the fair-value hierarchy when there is reliance on at least one significant unobservable input to the valuation model. In addition to these unobservable inputs, the valuation models for Level 3 financial instruments typically also rely on a number of inputs that are readily observable either directly or indirectly. Thus, the gains and losses presented below include changes in the fair value related to both observable and unobservable inputs. The Company often hedges positions with offsetting positions that are classified in a different level. For example, the gains and losses for assets and liabilities in the Level 3 category presented in the tables below do not reflect the effect of offsetting losses and gains on hedging instruments that have been classified by the Company in the Level 1 and Level 2 categories. In addition, the Company hedges items classified in the Level 3 category with instruments also classified in Level 3 of the fair-value hierarchy. The effects of these hedges are presented gross in the following tables. 198 Table of Contents December 31,2007 Net realized/unrealizedgains (losses) included in Transfersin and/orout ofLevel 3 Purchases,issuancesandsettlements December 31,2008 Unrealizedgains(losses) still held(3) In millions of dollars Principaltransactions Other (1) (2) Assets Securities purchased under agreements to resell $ 16 $  $  $  $ (16 ) $  $  Trading account assets Trading securities and loans 75,573 (28,052 )  7,418 (4,166 ) 50,773 (19,572 ) Derivatives, net (4) (2,470 ) 7,804  (2,188 ) 440 3,586 9,622 Investments 17,060  (4,917 ) 5,787 10,343 28,273 (801 ) Loans 9  (15 )  166 160 (19 ) Mortgage servicing rights 8,380  (1,870 )  (853 ) 5,657 (1,870 ) Other financial assets measured on a recurring basis 1,171  86 422 (1,320 ) 359 86 Liabilities Interest-bearing deposits $ 56 $ (5 ) $  $ 13 $ (20 ) $ 54 $ (3 ) Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 6,158 (273 )  6,158 (1,422 ) 11,167 (136 ) Trading account liabilities Securities sold, not yet purchased 473 153  1,036 (703 ) 653 328 Short-term borrowings 5,016 106  (1,798 ) (1,783 ) 1,329 (63 ) Long-term debt 8,953 2,228  38,792 (34,319 ) 11,198 1,115 Other financial liabilities measured on a recurring basis 1  (61 )  (61 ) 1  January 1,2007 Net realized/unrealizedgains (losses) included in Transfersin and/orout ofLevel 3 Purchases,issuancesandsettlements December 31,2007 Unrealizedgains(losses) still held(3) In millions of dollars Principaltransactions Other (1) (2) Assets Securities purchased under agreements to resell $ 16 $  $  $  $  $ 16 $  Trading account assets Trading securities and loans 22,415 (11,449 )  21,132 43,475 75,573 (10,262 ) Investments 11,468  895 1,651 3,046 17,060 136 Loans  (8 )  (793 ) 810 9  Mortgage servicing rights 5,439  621  2,320 8,380 1,892 Other financial assets measured on a recurring basis 948  2 (43 ) 264 1,171 20 Liabilities Interest-bearing deposits $ 60 $ 12 $ 34 $ (33 ) $ 75 $ 56 $ (45 ) Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 6,778 (194 )  78 (892 ) 6,158 (141 ) Trading account liabilities Securities sold, not yet purchased 467 (139 )  (1,041 ) 908 473 (260 ) Derivatives, net (4) (1,875 ) (3,840 )  (3,280 ) 3,785 2,470 (9,462 ) Short-term borrowings 2,214 9 (80 ) 1,139 1,592 5,016 (53 ) Long-term debt 1,693 (11 ) (689 ) 4,600 1,960 8,953 (776 ) Other financial liabilities measured on a recurring basis   (23 ) (1 ) (21 ) 1  (1) Changes in fair value for available-for-sale investments (debt securities) are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), while gains from sales and losses due to other-than-temporary impairments are recorded in Realized gains (losses) from sales of investments on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

(4) Total Level 3 derivative exposures have been netted on these tables for presentation purposes only. 199 Table of Contents The following is a discussion of the changes to the Level 3 balances for each of the roll-forward tables presented above. The significant changes from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 in Level 3 assets and liabilities are due to: - A net decrease in trading securities and loans of $24.8 billion that was driven by: (i) Net realized and unrealized losses of $28.1 billion recorded in Principal transactions, which composed mostly of write-downs recognized on various trading securities including ABCP of $9 billion; (ii) Net transfers in of $7.4 billion, which consisted of approximately $26 billion of net transfers in from Level 2 to Level 3 as the availability of observable pricing inputs continued to decline due to the current credit crisis, offset by transfers out of Level 3 of approximately $19 billion primarily related to Level 3 trading inventory being reclassified to held-to-maturity investments during the fourth quarter of 2008; and (iii) Net settlements of trading securities of $4.2 billion in Level 3. - The shift in the Level 3 net unrealized gains/(losses) from trading derivatives driven by: (i) A net gain of $7.8 billion relating to complex derivative contracts, such as those linked to credit, equity and commodity exposures. These gains include both realized and unrealized gains during 2008 and are partially offset by losses recognized in instruments that have been classified in Levels 1 and 2; (ii) $2.2 billion in net transfers in and/or out of Level 3, representing a net transfer in of derivative liabilities during the year. - The increase in Level 3 Investments of $11.2 billion primarily resulted from: (i) The addition of $10.3 billion from net purchases, issuances and settlements, which included $8.7 billion in senior debt securities retained by the Company from its sale of a corporate loan portfolio that included highly leveraged loans during the second quarter of 2008, plus $3 billion of ARS securities purchased from GWM clients, in accordance with the Auction Rate Securities settlement agreement ; (ii) The net transfer in of investment securities from Level 2 to Level 3 of $5.8 billion, as the availability of observable pricing inputs continued to decline due to the current credit crisis; and (iii) Net losses recognized of $4.9 billion which was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) primarily related to Alt-A MBS classified as available-for-sale investments. - The decrease in Mortgage Servicing Rights of $2.7 billion was primarily attributed to mark-to-market losses recognized in the portfolio due to decreases in the mortgage interest rates and increases in refinancing. - The increase in the Level 3 balance for Securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $5 billion is driven by a $6.2 billion increase from net transfers in as the continued credit crisis impacted the availability of observable inputs for the underlying securities related to this liability. This was offset by a reduction from net settlements of $1.4 billion. - The decrease in Level 3 short-term borrowings of $3.7 billion is due to net transfers out of $1.8 billion as valuation methodology inputs considered to be unobservable were determined not to be significant to the overall valuation. In addition, net payments of $1.8 billion were made during 2008 against the Level 3 short-term debt obligations. - The increase in Level 3 Long-term debt of $2.2 billion is driven by: (i) The net transfers in of $38.8 billion, substantially all of which related to the transfer of consolidated SIV debt in the first quarter of 2008, as the availability of observable inputs continued to decline due to the current crisis; offset by (ii) $2.2 billion in gains recognized as credit spreads widened during the year; (iii) $34.3 billion decrease from net settlements/payments. Included in these settlements were $21 billion of payments made on maturing SIV debt and the replacement of $17 billion of non-recourse, consolidated SIV debt classified as Level 3 with Citigroup debt classified as Level 2. This replacement occurred in connection with the purchase of the SIV assets by the Company in November 2008. The significant changes from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007 in Level 3 assets and liabilities are due to: - The increase in trading securities and loans of $53.2 billion that was driven primarily by: (i) The net additions/purchases of $43.5 billion, which included asset-backed commercial paper purchases where the Company had liquidity puts and assets bought with Nikko Cordial acquisitions (ii) The net transfers in of $21.1 billion for items previously classified as Level 2 as prices and other valuation inputs became unobservable with the market dislocation crises that began in the second half of 2007; and (iii) Mark-to-market losses of $11.4 billion primarily attributable to writedowns on super senior tranches, junior tranches, ABCP and other related inventory. - The increase in Level 3 Investments of $5.6 billion, primarily resulting from the acquisition of Nikko Cordial. - The increase in Mortgage servicing rights of $2.9 billion which was primarily due to the first quarter 2007 acquisition of ABN AMRO Mortgage Group. - The decrease in net derivative trading account assets of $4.4 billion was due to mark-to-market losses and net purchases/originations of $3.8 billion, offset by net transfers in of Level 3 trading derivative liabilities of $3.3 billion. 200 Table of Contents - The increase in Level 3 Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt of $2.8 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively, resulted from transfers in of Level 2 positions as prices and other valuation inputs became unobservable, plus the additions of new issuances for fair value accounting was elected. Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the tables above. These include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment. In addition, assets such as loans held for sale that are measured at the lower of cost or market (LOCOM) that were recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period. The Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $9.6 billion as of December 31, 2008, as determined based on Level 3 inputs. The primary cause of goodwill impairment was the overall weak industry outlook and continuing operating losses. These factors contributed to the overall decline in the stock price and the related market capitalization of Citigroup. See Note 19, Goodwill and Intangible Assets on page 166, for additional information on goodwill impairment. The Company performed an impairment analysis of intangible assets related to the Old Lane multi-strategy hedge fund during the first quarter of 2008. As a result, a pre-tax write-down of $202 million, representing the remaining unamortized balance of the intangible assets, was recorded during the first quarter of 2008. The measurement of fair value was determined using Level 3 input factors along with a discounted cash flow approach. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company performed an impairment analysis of Japan's Nikko Asset Management fund contracts which represent the rights to manage and collect fees on investor assets and are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets. As a result, an impairment loss of $937 million pre-tax was recorded. The related fair value was determined using an income approach which relies on key drivers and future expectations of the business that are considered Level 3 input factors. The fair value of loans measured on a LOCOM basis is determined where possible using quoted secondary-market prices. Such loans are generally classified in Level 2 of the fair-value hierarchy given the level of activity in the market and the frequency of available quotes. If no such quoted price exists, the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets, adjusted for the specific attributes of that loan. The following table presents all loans held-for-sale that are carried at LOCOM as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 (in billions): Aggregate cost Fair value Level 2 Level 3 December 31, 2008 $ 3.1 $ 2.1 $ 0.8 $ 1.3 December 31, 2007 33.6 31.9 5.1 26.8 Loans held-for-sale that are carried at LOCOM as of December 31, 2008 significantly declined compared to December 31, 2007 because most of these loans were either sold or reclassified to held-for-investment category. 201 Table of Contents 27. FAIR-VALUE ELECTIONS (SFAS 155, SFAS 156 AND SFAS 159) Under SFAS 159, the Company may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in earnings. After the initial adoption, the election is made upon the acquisition of an eligible financial asset, financial liability or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair-value election may not be revoked once an election is made. Additionally, the transition provisions of SFAS 159 permit a one-time election for existing positions at the adoption date with a cumulative-effect adjustment included in opening retained earnings and future changes in fair value reported in earnings. The Company also has elected the fair-value accounting provisions permitted under SFAS 155 and SFAS 156 for certain assets and liabilities. In accordance with SFAS 155, which was primarily adopted on a prospective basis, hybrid financial instruments, such as structured notes containing embedded derivatives that otherwise would require bifurcation, as well as certain interest-only instruments, may be accounted for at fair value if the Company makes an irrevocable election to do so on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings. Additional discussion regarding the applicable areas in which SFAS 155 was adopted is presented in Note 26 on page 192. SFAS 156 requires all servicing rights to be recognized initially at fair value. At its initial adoption, the standard permits a one-time irrevocable election to re-measure each class of servicing rights at fair value, with the changes in fair value recorded in current earnings. The classes of servicing rights are identified based on the availability of market inputs used in determining their fair values and the methods for managing their risks. The Company has elected fair-value accounting for its mortgage and student loan classes of servicing rights. The impact of adopting this standard was not material. See Note 23 on page 174 for further discussions regarding the accounting and reporting of mortgage servicing rights. 202 Table of Contents The following table presents, as of December 31, 2008, the fair value of those positions selected for fair-value accounting in accordance with SFAS 159, SFAS 156, and SFAS 155, as well as the changes in fair value for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007.

The estimated change in the fair value of these liabilities due to such changes in the Companys own credit risk (or instrument-specific credit risk) was a gain of $1,982 million and $212 million for the three months ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively, and a gain of $4,558 million and $888 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk were estimated by incorporating the Companys current observable credit spreads into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as described above. SFAS 159 The Fair-Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Detailed below are the December 31, 2006 carrying values prior to adoption of SFAS 159, the transition adjustments booked to opening Retained earnings and the fair values (that is, the carrying values at January 1, 2007 after adoption) for those items that were selected for fair-value option accounting and that had an impact on Retained earnings: In millions of dollars December 31, 2006 (carrying valueprior to adoption) Cumulative-effectadjustment toJanuary 1, 2007retained earnings gain (loss) January 1, 2007 fair value (carrying valueafter adoption) Legg Mason convertible preferred equity securities originally classified as available-for-sale (1) $ 797 $ (232 ) $ 797 Selected portfolios of securities purchased under agreements to resell (2) 167,525 25 167,550 Selected portfolios of securities sold under agreements to repurchase (2) 237,788 40 237,748 Selected non-collateralized short-term borrowings 3,284 (7 ) 3,291 Selected letters of credit hedged by credit default swaps or participation notes  14 14 Various miscellaneous eligible items (1) 96 3 96 Pretax cumulative effect of adopting fair-value option accounting $ (157 ) After-tax cumulative effect of adopting fair-value option accounting (99 ) (1) The Legg Mason securities as well as several miscellaneous items were previously reported at fair value in available-for-sale securities. The cumulative-effect adjustment represents the reclassification of the related unrealized gain/loss from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Retained earnings upon the adoption of the fair value option. (2) Excludes netting of the amounts due from securities purchased under agreements to resell and the amounts owed under securities sold under agreements to repurchase in accordance with FIN 41. Additional information regarding each of these items and other fair-value elections follows. Legg Mason convertible preferred equity securities The Legg Mason convertible preferred equity securities (Legg shares) were acquired in connection with the sale of Citigroups Asset Management business in December 2005. Prior to the election of fair-value option accounting, the shares were classified as available-for-sale securities with the unrealized loss of $232 million as of December 31, 2006 included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). In connection with the Companys adoption of SFAS 159, this unrealized loss was recorded as a reduction of January 1, 2007 Retained earnings as part of the cumulative-effect adjustment. During the first quarter of 2008, the Company sold the remaining 8.4 million Legg shares at a pretax loss of $10.3 million ($6.7 million after-tax). Selected portfolios of securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities borrowed, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities loaned and certain non-collateralized short-term borrowings The Company elected the fair-value option retrospectively for our United States and United Kingdom portfolios of fixed-income securities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed-income securities sold under agreements to repurchase (and certain non-collateralized short-term borrowings). The fair-value option was also elected prospectively in the second quarter of 2007 for certain portfolios of fixed-income securities lending and borrowing transactions based in Japan. In each case, the election was made because the related interest-rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, primarily with derivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings. Previously, these positions were accounted for on an accrual basis. Changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in Principal transactions. The related interest revenue and interest expense are measured based on the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported as interest revenue and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Selected letters of credit and revolving loans hedged by credit default swaps or participation notes The Company has elected the fair-value option for certain letters of credit that are hedged with derivative instruments or participation notes. Upon electing the fair-value option, the related portions of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded lending commitments were reversed. Citigroup elected the fair-value option for these transactions because the risk is managed on a fair-value basis and to mitigate accounting mismatches. 204 Table of Contents The notional amount of these unfunded letters of credit was $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. The amount funded was insignificant with no amounts 90 days or more past due or on a non-accrual status at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. These items have been classified appropriately in Trading account assets or Trading account liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in fair value of these items are classified in Principal transactions in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income. Other items for which the fair-value option was selected in accordance with SFAS 159 The Company has elected the fair-value option for the following eligible items, which did not affect opening Retained earnings:  certain credit products;  certain investments in private equity and real estate ventures and certain equity-method investments;  certain structured liabilities;  certain non-structured liabilities; and  certain mortgage loans Certain credit products Citigroup has elected the fair-value option for certain originated and purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of credit, executed by Citigroups trading businesses. None of these credit products is a highly leveraged financing commitment. Significant groups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near term, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party. Citigroup has elected the fair-value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending transactions across the Company, including where those management objectives would not be met. The following table provides information about certain credit products carried at fair value: 2008 2007 In millions of dollars Tradingassets Loans Tradingassets Loans Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet $ 16,254 $ 2,315 $ 26,020 $ 3,038 Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value $ 6,501 $ 3 $ 899 $ (5 ) Balance on non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due $ 77 $ 1,113 $ 186 $ 1,292 Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due $ 190 $ (4 ) $ 68 $  In addition to the amounts reported above, $72 million and $141 million of unfunded loan commitments related to certain credit products selected for fair-value accounting were outstanding as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. Changes in fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are classified in Principal transactions in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest revenue on trading account assets or loans depending on their balance sheet classifications. The changes in fair value for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to a loss of $38 million and $188 million, respectively. Certain investments in private equity and real estate ventures and certain equity method investments Citigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for the purpose of earning investment returns and for capital appreciation. The Company has elected the fair-value option for certain of these ventures, because such investments are considered similar to many private equity or hedge fund activities in our investment companies, which are reported at fair value. The fair-value option brings consistency in the accounting and evaluation of certain of these investments. As required by SFAS 159, all investments (debt and equity) in such private equity and real estate entities are accounted for at fair value. These investments are classified as Investments on Citigroups Consolidated Balance Sheet. Citigroup also holds various non-strategic investments in leveraged buyout funds and other hedge funds that previously were required to be accounted for under the equity method. The Company elected fair-value accounting to reduce operational and accounting complexity. Since the funds account for all of their underlying assets at fair value, the impact of applying the equity method to Citigroups investment in these funds was equivalent to fair-value accounting. Thus, this fair-value election had no impact on opening Retained earnings. These investments are classified as Other assets on Citigroups Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair values of these investments are classified in Other revenue in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income. Certain structured liabilities The Company has elected the fair-value option for certain structured liabilities whose performance is linked to structured interest rates, inflation or currency risks (structured liabilities). The Company elected the fair-value option, because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair-value basis. These positions will continue to be classified as debt, deposits or derivatives (Trading account liabilities) on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet according to their legal form. For those structured liabilities classified as Long-term debt for which the fair-value option has been elected, the aggregate unpaid principal balance exceeds the aggregate fair value of such instruments by $277 million as of December 31, 2008 and $7 million as of December 31, 2007. The change in fair value for these structured liabilities is reported in Principal transactions in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income. Related interest expense is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the Consolidated Income Statement. Certain non-structured liabilities The Company has elected the fair-value option for certain non-structured liabilities with fixed and floating interest rates (non-structured liabilities). 205 Table of Contents The Company has elected the fair-value option where the interest-rate risk of such liabilities is economically hedged with derivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase financial assets that will also be accounted for at fair value through earnings. The election has been made to mitigate accounting mismatches and to achieve operational simplifications. These positions are reported in Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. The majority of these non-structured liabilities are a result of the Companys election of the fair-value option for liabilities associated with the Citi-advised Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs), which were consolidated during the fourth quarter of 2007. The change in fair values of the SIVs liabilities reported in earnings was $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. For these non-structured liabilities the aggregate fair value is $263 million lower than the aggregate unpaid principal balance as of December 31, 2008. For all other non-structured liabilities classified as Long-term debt for which the fair-value option has been elected, the aggregate unpaid principal balance exceeds the aggregate fair value of such instruments by $97 million as of December 31, 2008 while the aggregate fair value exceeded the aggregate unpaid principal by $112 million as of December 31, 2007. The change in fair value of these non-structured liabilities reported a gain of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. The change in fair value for these non-structured liabilities is reported in Principal transactions in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income. Related interest expense continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the Consolidated Income Statement. Certain mortgage loans Citigroup has elected the fair-value option for certain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans held-for-sale. These loans are intended for sale or securitization and are hedged with derivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair-value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications. The fair-value option was not elected for loans held-for-investment, as those loans are not hedged with derivative instruments. This election was effective for applicable instruments originated or purchased on or after September 1, 2007. The following table provides information about certain mortgage loans carried at fair value: In millions of dollars December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet $ 4,273 $ 6,392 Aggregate fair value in excess of unpaid principal balance $ 138 $ 136 Balance on non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due $ 9 $ 17 Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due $ 2 $  The changes in fair values of these mortgage loans is reported in Other revenue in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income. The changes in fair value during the year ended December 31, 2008 due to instrument-specific credit risk resulted in a $32 million loss. The change in fair value during 2007 due to instrument-specific credit risk was immaterial. Related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the Consolidated Income Statement. Items selected for fair-value accounting in accordance with SFAS 155 and SFAS 156 Certain hybrid financial instruments The Company has elected to apply fair-value accounting under SFAS 155 for certain hybrid financial assets and liabilities whose performance is linked to risks other than interest rate, foreign exchange or inflation (e.g., equity, credit or commodity risks). In addition, the Company has elected fair-value accounting under SFAS 155 for residual interests retained from securitizing certain financial assets. The Company has elected fair-value accounting for these instruments because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair-value basis. In addition, the accounting for these instruments is simplified under a fair-value approach as it eliminates the complicated operational requirements of bifurcating the embedded derivatives from the host contracts and accounting for each separately. The hybrid financial instruments are classified as Trading account assets, Loans, Deposits, Trading account liabilities (for prepaid derivatives), Short-term borrowings or Long-Term Debt on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet according to their legal form, while residual interests in certain securitizations are classified as Trading account assets. For hybrid financial instruments for which fair-value accounting has been elected under SFAS 155 and that are classified as Long-term debt, the aggregate unpaid principal exceeds the aggregate fair value by $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2008, while the aggregate fair value exceeds the aggregate unpaid principal balance by $460 million as of December 31, 2007. The difference for those instruments classified as Loans is immaterial. Changes in fair value for hybrid financial instruments, which in most cases includes a component for accrued interest, are recorded in Principal transactions in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income. Interest accruals for certain hybrid instruments classified as trading assets are recorded separately from the change in fair value as Interest revenue in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income. Mortgage servicing rights The Company accounts for mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) at fair value in accordance with SFAS 156. Fair value for MSRs is determined using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest-rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted rates. The model assumptions used in the valuation of MSRs include mortgage prepayment speeds and discount rates. The fair value of MSRs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates. In managing this risk, the Company hedges a significant portion of the values of its MSRs through the use of interest-rate derivative contracts, forward-purchase commitments of mortgage-backed securities, and purchased securities classified as trading. See Note 23 on page 174 for further discussions regarding the accounting and reporting of MSRs. These MSRs, which totaled $5.7 billion and $8.4 billion as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively, are classified as Mortgage servicing rights on Citigroups Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in fair value of MSRs are recorded in Commissions and fees in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income. 206 Table of Contents 28. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (SFAS 107) Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments The table below presents the carrying value and fair value of Citigroups financial instruments. The disclosure excludes leases, affiliate investments, pension and benefit obligations and insurance policy claim reserves. In addition, contractholder fund amounts exclude certain insurance contracts. Also as required, the disclosure excludes the effect of taxes, any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular instrument, excess fair value associated with deposits with no fixed maturity and other expenses that would be incurred in a market transaction. In addition, the table excludes the values of non-financial assets and liabilities, as well as a wide range of franchise, relationship and intangible values (but includes mortgage servicing rights), which are integral to a full assessment of Citigroups financial position and the value of its net assets. The fair value represents managements best estimates based on a range of methodologies and assumptions. The carrying value of short-term financial instruments not accounted for at fair value under SFAS 155 or SFAS 159, as well as receivables and payables arising in the ordinary course of business, approximates fair value because of the relatively short period of time between their origination and expected realization. Quoted market prices are used when available for investments and for both trading and end-user derivatives, as well as for liabilities, such as long-term debt, with quoted prices. For performing loans not accounted for at fair value under SFAS 155 or SFAS 159, contractual cash flows are discounted at quoted secondary market rates or estimated market rates if available. Otherwise, sales of comparable loan portfolios or current market origination rates for loans with similar terms and risk characteristics are used. For loans with doubt as to collectibility, expected cash flows are discounted using an appropriate rate considering the time of collection and the premium for the uncertainty of the flows. The value of collateral is also considered. For liabilities such as long-term debt not accounted for at fair value under SFAS 155 or SFAS 159 and without quoted market prices, market borrowing rates of interest are used to discount contractual cash flows. For additional information regarding the Companys determination of fair value, including items accounted for at fair value under SFAS 155, SFAS 156, and SFAS 159, see Note 27 on page 200. 2008 2007 In billions of dollars at year end Carryingvalue Estimatedfair value Carryingvalue Estimated fair value Assets Investments $ 256.0 $ 251.9 $ 215.0 $ 215.0 Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell 184.1 184.1 274.1 274.1 Trading account assets 377.6 377.6 539.0 539.0 Loans (1) 660.9 642.7 753.7 769.4 Other financial assets (2) 316.6 316.6 268.8 269.0 2008 2007 In billions of dollars at year end Carryingvalue Estimatedfair value Carryingvalue Estimated fair value Liabilities Deposits $ 774.2 $ 772.9 $ 826.2 $ 826.2 Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 205.3 205.3 304.2 304.2 Trading account liabilities 167.5 167.5 182.1 182.1 Long-term debt 359.6 317.1 427.1 422.6 Other financial liabilities (3) 253.9 253.9 280.4 280.4 (1) The carrying value of loans is net of the Allowance for loan losses of $29.6 billion for 2008 and $16.1 billion for 2007. In addition, the carrying values exclude $3.7 billion and $8.2 billion of lease finance receivables in 2008 and 2007, respectively. (2) Includes cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, brokerage receivables, reinsurance recoverable, mortgage servicing rights, separate and variable accounts and other financial instruments included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, all of which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value. (3) Includes brokerage payables, separate and variable accounts, short-term borrowings and other financial instruments included in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, all of which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Fair values vary from period to period based on changes in a wide range of factors, including interest rates, credit quality, and market perceptions of value and as existing assets and liabilities run off and new transactions are entered into. The estimated fair values of loans reflect changes in credit status since the loans were made, changes in interest rates in the case of fixed-rate loans, and premium values at origination of certain loans. The carrying values (reduced by the Allowance for loan losses) exceeded the estimated fair values of Citigroups loans, in aggregate, by $18.2 billion in 2008 while the estimated fair values of Citigroup loans, in aggregate, exceeded the carrying values (reduced by the allowance for loan losses) by $15.7 billion in 2007. Within these totals, carrying values net of allowance exceeded estimated fair value for consumer loans by $15.9 billion, a decrease of $28.6 billion from 2007. The carrying values net of allowance exceeded the estimated fair values by $2.3 billion for corporate loans, a decrease of $5.3 billion from 2007. 207 Table of Contents 29. PLEDGED ASSETS, COLLATERAL, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES Pledged Assets At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the approximate fair values of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other assets pledged, excluding the impact of FIN 39 and FIN 41, were as follows: In millions of dollars 2008 2007(1) For securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 237,055 $ 296,991 As collateral for securities borrowed for approximately equivalent value 81,740 75,572 As collateral on bank loans 144,982 151,957 To clearing organizations or segregated under securities laws and regulations 41,312 42,793 For securities loaned 51,158 94,161 Other 52,576 27,847 Total $ 608,823 $ 689,321 (1) Reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. In addition, included in cash and due from banks at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are $11.7 billion and $9.6 billion, respectively, of cash segregated under federal and other brokerage regulations or deposited with clearing organizations. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $3.1 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit from third-party banks to satisfy various collateral and margin requirements. Collateral At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the approximate market value of collateral received by the Company that may be sold or repledged by the Company, excluding amounts netted in accordance with FIN 39 and FIN 41, was $340.2 billion and $405.0 billion, respectively. This collateral was received in connection with resale agreements, securities borrowings and loans, derivative transactions and margined broker loans. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, a substantial portion of the collateral received by the Company had been sold or repledged in connection with repurchase agreements, securities sold, not yet purchased, securities borrowings and loans, pledges to clearing organizations, segregation requirements under securities laws and regulations, derivative transactions and bank loans. In addition, at December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had pledged $236 billion and $196 billion, respectively, of collateral that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties. Lease Commitments Rental expense (principally for offices and computer equipment) was $2.7 billion, $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Future minimum annual rentals under noncancelable leases, net of sublease income, are as follows: In millions of dollars 2009 $ 1,470 2010 1,328 2011 1,134 2012 1,010 2013 922 Thereafter 3,415 Total $ 9,279 Guarantees The Company provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to Citigroup customers to enhance their credit standing and enable them to complete a wide variety of business transactions. FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45), provides initial measurement and disclosure guidance in accounting for guarantees. FIN 45 requires that, for certain contracts meeting the definition of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize, at inception, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. In addition, the guarantor must disclose the maximum potential amount of future payments the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee, if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties. The determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. Such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these guarantees. The following tables present information about the Companys guarantees at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007: Maximum potential amount of future payments Carrying value(in millions) In billions of dollars at December 31, except carrying value in millions Expire within1 year Expire after1 year Total amountoutstanding 2008 Financial standby letters of credit $ 31.6 $ 62.6 $ 94.2 $ 289.0 Performance guarantees 9.4 6.9 16.3 23.6 Derivative instruments considered to be guarantees 22.5 45.4 67.9 1,301.5 Guarantees of collection of contractual cash flows (1)  0.3 0.3  Loans sold with recourse  0.3 0.3 56.4 Securities lending indemnifications (1) 47.6  47.6  Credit card merchant processing (1) 56.7  56.7  Custody indemnifications and other  21.6 21.6 149.2 Total $ 167.8 $ 137.1 $ 304.9 $ 1,819.7 208 Table of Contents Maximum potential amount of future payments Carrying value(in millions) In billions of dollars at December 31, except carrying value in millions Expire within1 year Expire after1 year Total amountoutstanding 2007 (2) Financial standby letters of credit $ 43.5 $ 43.6 $ 87.1 $ 160.6 Performance guarantees 11.3 6.8 18.1 24.4 Derivative instruments considered to be guarantees 4.2 0.7 4.9 163.0 Loans sold with recourse  0.5 0.5 45.5 Securities lending indemnifications (1) 153.4  153.4  Credit card merchant processing (1) 64.0  64.0  Custody indemnifications and other  53.4 53.4 306.0 Total $ 276.4 $ 105.0 $ 381.4 $ 699.5 (1) The carrying values of guarantees of collections of contractual cash flows, securities lending indemnifications and credit card merchant processing are not material, as the Company has determined that the amount and probability of potential liabilities arising from these guarantees are not significant. (2) Reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. Financial Standby Letters of Credit Citigroup issues standby letters of credit which substitute its own credit for that of the borrower. If a letter of credit is drawn down, the borrower is obligated to repay Citigroup. Standby letters of credit protect a third party from defaults on contractual obligations. Financial standby letters of credit include guarantees of payment of insurance premiums and reinsurance risks that support industrial revenue bond underwriting and settlement of payment obligations to clearing houses, and also support options and purchases of securities or are in lieu of escrow deposit accounts. Financial standbys also backstop loans, credit facilities, promissory notes and trade acceptances. Performance Guarantees Performance guarantees and letters of credit are issued to guarantee a customers tender bid on a construction or systems-installation project or to guarantee completion of such projects in accordance with contract terms. They are also issued to support a customers obligation to supply specified products, commodities, or maintenance or warranty services to a third party. Derivative Instruments Considered to Be Guarantees Derivatives are financial instruments whose cash flows are based on a notional amount or an underlying instrument, where there is little or no initial investment, and whose terms require or permit net settlement. Derivatives may be used for a variety of reasons, including risk management, or to enhance returns. Financial institutions often act as intermediaries for their clients, helping clients reduce their risks. However, derivatives may also be used to take a risk position. The derivative instruments considered guarantees, which are presented in the table above, include only those instruments that require Citi to make payments to the counterparty based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset, a liability, or an equity security held by the guaranteed party. More specifically, derivative instruments considered guarantees include certain over-the-counter written put options where the counterparty is not a bank, hedge fund or broker-dealer (such counterparties are considered to be dealers in these markets, and may therefore not hold the underlying instruments). However, credit derivatives sold by the Company are excluded from this presentation, as they are disclosed separately within this note below. In addition, non-credit derivative contracts that are cash settled and for which the Company is unable to assert that it is probable the counterparty held the underlying instrument at the inception of the contract also are excluded from the disclosure above. In instances where the Companys maximum potential future payment is unlimited, the notional amount of the contract is disclosed. Guarantees of Collection of Contractual Cash Flows Guarantees of collection of contractual cash flows protect investors in credit card receivables securitization trusts from loss of interest relating to insufficient collections on the underlying receivables in the trusts. Loans Sold with Recourse Loans sold with recourse represent the Companys obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under certain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales agreement under which a lender will fully reimburse the buyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased loans. This may be accomplished by the sellers taking back any loans that become delinquent. Securities Lending Indemnifications Owners of securities frequently lend those securities for a fee to other parties who may sell them short or deliver them to another party to satisfy some other obligation. Banks may administer such securities lending programs for their clients. Securities lending indemnifications are issued by the bank to guarantee that a securities lending customer will be made whole in the event that the security borrower does not return the security subject to the lending agreement and collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the security. Credit Card Merchant Processing Credit card merchant processing guarantees represent the Companys indirect obligations in connection with the processing of private label and bankcard transactions on behalf of merchants. Citigroups primary credit card business is the issuance of credit cards to individuals. In addition, the Company provides transaction processing services to various merchants with respect to bankcard and private-label cards. In the event of a billing dispute with respect to a bankcard transaction between a merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholders favor, the third party holds the primary contingent liability to credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the third party is unable to collect this amount from the merchant, it bears the loss for the amount of the credit or refund paid to the cardholder. The Company continues to have the primary contingent liability with respect to its portfolio of private-label merchants. The risk of loss is mitigated as the cash flows between the third party or the Company and the merchant are settled on a net basis and the third party or the Company has the right to 209 Table of Contents offset any payments with cash flows otherwise due to the merchant. To further mitigate this risk, the third party or the Company may require a merchant to make an escrow deposit, delay settlement, or include event triggers to provide the third party or the Company with more financial and operational control in the event of the financial deterioration of the merchant, or require various credit enhancements (including letters of credit and bank guarantees). In the unlikely event that a private label merchant is unable to deliver products, services or a refund to its private label cardholders, Citigroup is contingently liable to credit or refund cardholders. In addition, although a third party holds the primary contingent liability with respect to the processing of bankcard transactions, in the event that the third party does not have sufficient collateral from the merchant or sufficient financial resources of its own to provide the credit or refunds to the cardholders, Citigroup would be liable to credit or refund the cardholders. The Companys maximum potential contingent liability related to both bankcard and private label merchant processing services is estimated to be the total volume of credit card transactions that meet the requirements to be valid chargeback transactions at any given time. At December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be $57 billion and $64 billion, respectively. However, the Company believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on the Companys historical experience and its position as a secondary guarantor (in the case of bankcards). In most cases, this contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants. The Company assesses the probability and amount of its contingent liability related to merchant processing based on the financial strength of the primary guarantor (in the case of bankcards) and the extent and nature of unresolved chargebacks and its historical loss experience. At December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the estimated losses incurred and the carrying amounts of the Companys contingent obligations related to merchant processing activities were immaterial. Custody Indemnifications Custody indemnifications are issued to guarantee that custody clients will be made whole in the event that a third-party subcustodian or depository institution fails to safeguard clients assets. Other In the fourth quarter of 2007, Citigroup recorded a $306 million (pretax) charge related to certain of Visa USAs litigation matters. As of December 31, 2008, the carrying value of the reserve was $149 million and was included in Other liabilities. Other Guarantees and Indemnifications The Company, through its credit card business, provides various cardholder protection programs on several of its card products, including programs that provide insurance coverage for rental cars, coverage for certain losses associated with purchased products, price protection for certain purchases and protection for lost luggage. These guarantees are not included in the table, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and the Companys maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The protection is limited to certain types of purchases and certain types of losses and it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would qualify for these benefits at any given time. The Company assesses the probability and amount of its potential liability related to these programs based on the extent and nature of its historical loss experience. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the actual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of the Companys obligations related to these programs were immaterial. In the normal course of business, the Company provides standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with numerous transactions and also provides indemnifications that protect the counterparties to the contracts in the event that additional taxes are owed due either to a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law. Counterparties to these transactions provide the Company with comparable indemnifications. While such representations, warranties and tax indemnifications are essential components of many contractual relationships, they do not represent the underlying business purpose for the transactions. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms related to the Companys own performance under the terms of a contract and are entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss is remote. Often these clauses are intended to ensure that terms of a contract are met at inception (for example, that loans transferred to a counterparty in a sales transaction did in fact meet the conditions specified in the contract at the transfer date). No compensation is received for these standard representations and warranties, and it is not possible to determine their fair value because they rarely, if ever, result in a payment. In many cases, there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and the contingencies potentially triggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and are not expected to occur. There are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, related to these indemnifications and they are not included in the table. In addition, the Company is a member of or shareholder in hundreds of value-transfer networks (VTNs) (payment clearing and settlement systems as well as securities exchanges) around the world. As a condition of membership, many of these VTNs require that members stand ready to backstop the net effect on the VTNs of a members default on its obligations. The Companys potential obligations as a shareholder or member of VTN associations are excluded from the scope of FIN 45, since the shareholders and members represent subordinated classes of investors in the VTNs. Accordingly, the Companys participation in VTNs is not reported in the table and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008 or December 31, 2007 for potential obligations that could arise from the Companys involvement with VTN associations. At December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the table amounted to approximately $1,820 million and $700 million, respectively. The carrying value of derivative instruments is included in either Trading liabilities or Other liabilities, depending upon whether the derivative was entered into for trading or non-trading purposes. The carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in Other liabilities. For loans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is included in Other liabilities. In addition, at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet include an allowance for credit losses of $887 million and $1.25 billion relating to letters of credit and unfunded lending commitments, respectively. Collateral Cash collateral available to the Company to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to $33 billion and $112 210 Table of Contents billion at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to $27 billion and $54 billion, the majority of which collateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities lending indemnifications. The decrease from the prior year is in line with the decrease in the notional amount of these indemnifications, which are collateralized. Additionally, letters of credit in favor of the Company held as collateral amounted to $503 million and $370 million at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. Other property may also be available to the Company to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of such property has not been determined. Performance Risk Citigroup evaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based on the assigned referenced counterparty internal or external ratings. Where external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are considered to be Baa/BBB and above, while anything below is considered non-investment grade. The Citigroup internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system. On certain underlying referenced credits or entities, ratings are not available. Such referenced credits are included in the Not-rated category. The maximum potential amount of the future payments related to guarantees and credit derivatives sold is determined to be the notional amount of these contracts, which is the par amount of the assets guaranteed. Presented in the table below is the maximum potential amount of future payments classified based upon internal and external credit ratings as of December 31, 2008. As previously mentioned, the determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. Such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these guarantees.

Credit derivatives generally require that the seller of credit protection make payments to the buyer upon the occurrence of predefined credit events (commonly referred to as settlement triggers). These settlement triggers are defined by the form of the derivative and the reference credit and are generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference credit and, in a more limited range of transactions, debt restructuring. Credit derivative transactions referring to emerging market reference credits will also typically include additional settlement triggers to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment moratorium. In certain transactions, protection may be provided on a portfolio of referenced credits or asset-backed securities. The seller of such protection may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the portfolio and/or may only be required to pay for losses up to a specified amount. The Company makes markets in and trades a range of credit derivatives, both on behalf of clients as well as for its own account. Through these contracts, the Company either purchases or writes protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference credits. The Company uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its corporate loan portfolio and other cash positions, to take proprietary trading positions, and to facilitate client transactions. The range of credit derivatives sold includes credit default swaps, total return swaps and credit options. A credit default swap is a contract in which, for a fee, a protection seller (guarantor) agrees to reimburse a protection buyer (beneficiary) for any losses that occur due to a credit event on a reference entity. If there is no credit default event or settlement trigger, as defined by the specific derivative contract, then the guarantor makes no payments to the beneficiary and receives only the contractually specified fee. However, if a credit event occurs and in accordance with the specific derivative contract sold, the guarantor will be required to make a payment to the beneficiary. A total return swap transfers the total economic performance of a reference asset, which includes all associated cash flows, as well as capital appreciation or depreciation. The protection buyer (beneficiary) receives a floating rate of interest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller (guarantor), and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference asset, plus any appreciation. Thus, the beneficiary will be obligated to make a payment any time the floating interest rate payment according to the total return swap agreement and any depreciation of the reference asset exceed the cash flows associated with the underlying asset. A total return swap may terminate upon a default of the reference asset subject to the provisions in the related total return swap agreement between the protection seller (guarantor) and the protection buyer (beneficiary). 211 Table of Contents A credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of the reference asset. For example, in a credit spread option, the option writer (guarantor) assumes the obligation to purchase or sell the reference asset at a specified strike spread level. The option purchaser (beneficiary) buys the right to sell the reference asset to, or purchase it from, the option writer at the strike spread level. The payments on credit spread options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the underlying credit-sensitive asset. The options usually terminate if the underlying assets default. A credit-linked note is a form of credit derivative structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default swap. The purchaser of the note writes credit protection to the issuer, and receives a return which will be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying reference credit. If the reference entity defaults, the purchaser of the credit-linked note may assume the long position in the debt security and any future cash flows from it but will lose the amount paid to the issuer of the credit-linked note. Thus the maximum amount of the exposure is the carrying amount of the credit-linked note. As of December 31, 2008, the amount of credit-linked notes held by the Company in trading inventory was immaterial. The following table summarizes the key characteristics of the Companys credit derivative portfolio as protection seller (guarantor) as of December 31, 2008: In millions of dollars Maximum potential amount of future payments Fairvalue(payable) By industry/counterparty Bank $ 943,949 $ 118,428 Broker-dealer 365,664 55,458 Monoline 139 91 Non-financial 7,540 2,556 Insurance and other financial institutions 125,988 21,700 Total by industry/counterparty $ 1,443,280 $ 198,233 By instrument: Credit default swaps and options $ 1,441,375 $ 197,981 Total return swaps and other 1,905 252 Total by instrument $ 1,443,280 $ 198,233 By rating: Investment grade $ 851,426 $ 83,672 Non-investment grade 410,483 87,508 Not rated 181,371 27,053 Total by rating $ 1,443,280 $ 198,233 Citigroup evaluates the payment/performance risk of the credit derivatives to which it stands as guarantor based on the credit rating which has been assigned to the underlying referenced credit. Where external ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (such as Moodys and S&P), are used, investment grade ratings are considered to be Baa/BBB or above, while anything below is considered non-investment grade. The Citigroup internal ratings are in line with the related external credit rating system. On certain underlying referenced credit, mainly related to over-the-counter credit derivatives, ratings are not available, and these are included in the not-rated category. Credit derivatives written on an underlying non-investment grade referenced credit represent greater payment risk to the Company. The non-investment grade category in the table above primarily includes credit derivatives where the underlying referenced entity has been downgraded subsequent to the inception of the derivative. The maximum potential amount of future payments under credit derivative contracts presented in the table above is based on the notional value of the derivatives. The Company believes that the maximum potential amount of future payments for credit protection sold is not representative of the actual loss exposure based on historical experience. This maximum potential amount has not been reduced by the Companys rights to the underlying assets and the related cash flows. In accordance with most credit derivative contracts, should a credit event (or settlement trigger) occur, the Company is usually liable for the difference between the protection sold and the recourse it holds in the value of the underlying assets. Thus, if the reference entity defaults, Citi will generally have a right to collect on the underlying reference credit and any related cash flows, while being liable for the full notional amount of credit protection sold to the buyer. Furthermore, this maximum potential amount of future payments for credit protection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral paid to a given counterparty, as such payments would be calculated after netting all derivative exposures, including any credit derivatives, with that counterparty in accordance with a related master netting agreement. Due to such netting processes, determining the amount of collateral that corresponds to credit derivative exposures only is not possible. The Company actively monitors open credit risk exposures, and manages this exposure using a variety of strategies including purchased credit derivatives, cash collateral or direct holdings of the referenced assets. This risk mitigation activity is not captured in the table above. 212 Table of Contents Credit Commitments The table below summarizes Citigroups other commitments as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. In millions of dollars U.S. Outside U.S. December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Commercial and similar letters of credit $ 2,187 $ 6,028 $ 8,215 $ 9,175 One- to four-family residential mortgages 628 309 937 4,587 Revolving open-end loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties 22,591 2,621 25,212 35,187 Commercial real estate, construction and land development 2,084 618 2,702 4,834 Credit card lines 867,261 135,176 1,002,437 1,103,535 Commercial and other consumer loan commitments 217,818 92,179 309,997 473,631 Total $ 1,112,569 $ 236,931 $ 1,349,500 $ 1,630,949 The majority of unused commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards. Commercial commitments generally have floating interest rates and fixed expiration dates and may require payment of fees. Such fees (net of certain direct costs) are deferred and, upon exercise of the commitment, amortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise is deemed remote, amortized over the commitment period. Commercial and similar letters of credit A commercial letter of credit is an instrument by which Citigroup substitutes its credit for that of a customer to enable the customer to finance the purchase of goods or to incur other commitments. Citigroup issues a letter on behalf of its client to a supplier and agrees to pay the supplier upon presentation of documentary evidence that the supplier has performed in accordance with the terms of the letter of credit. When drawn, the customer then is required to reimburse Citigroup. One- to four-family residential mortgages A one- to four-family residential mortgage commitment is a written confirmation from Citigroup to a seller of a property that the bank will advance the specified sums enabling the buyer to complete the purchase. Revolving open-end loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties Revolving open-end loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties are essentially home equity lines of credit. A home equity line of credit is a loan secured by a primary residence or second home to the extent of the excess of fair market value over the debt outstanding for the first mortgage. Commercial real estate, construction and land development Commercial real estate, construction and land development include unused portions of commitments to extend credit for the purpose of financing commercial and multifamily residential properties as well as land development projects. Both secured-by-real-estate and unsecured commitments are included in this line. In addition, undistributed loan proceeds, where there is an obligation to advance for construction progress, payments are also included in this line. However, this line only includes those extensions of credit that once funded will be classified as Loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit card lines Citigroup provides credit to customers by issuing credit cards. The credit card lines are unconditionally cancellable by the issuer. Commercial and other consumer loan commitments Commercial and other consumer loan commitments include commercial commitments to make or purchase loans, to purchase third-party receivables and to provide note issuance or revolving underwriting facilities. Amounts include $140 billion and $259 billion with an original maturity of less than one year at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. In addition, included in this line item are highly leveraged financing commitments which are agreements that provide funding to a borrower with higher levels of debt (measured by the ratio of debt capital to equity capital of the borrower) than is generally considered normal for other companies. This type of financing is commonly employed in corporate acquisitions, management buy-outs and similar transactions. 213 Table of Contents 30. CONTINGENCIES As described in the Legal Proceedings discussion on page 227, the Company has been a defendant in numerous lawsuits and other legal proceedings arising out of alleged misconduct in connection with: (i) underwritings for, and research coverage of, WorldCom; (ii) underwritings for Enron and other transactions and activities related to Enron; (iii) transactions and activities related to research coverage of companies other than WorldCom; and (iv) transactions and activities related to the IPO Securities Litigation. As of December 31, 2008, the Companys litigation reserve for these matters, net of amounts previously paid or not yet paid but committed to be paid in connection with the Enron class action settlement and other settlements arising out of these matters, was approximately $0.8 billion. The Company believes that this reserve is adequate to meet all of its remaining exposure for these matters. As described in the Legal Proceedings discussion on page 227, the Company is also a defendant in numerous lawsuits and other legal proceedings arising out of alleged misconduct in connection with other matters. In view of the large number of litigation matters, the uncertainties of the timing and outcome of this type of litigation, the novel issues presented, and the significant amounts involved, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be below the Companys litigation reserves. The Company will continue to defend itself vigorously in these cases, and seek to resolve them in the manner management believes is in the best interests of the Company. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Citigroup and its subsidiaries are defendants or co-defendants or parties in various litigation and regulatory matters incidental to and typical of the businesses in which they are engaged. In the opinion of the Companys management, the ultimate resolution of these legal and regulatory proceedings would not be likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company but, if involving monetary liability, may be material to the Companys operating results for any particular period. 31.

See Notes 1, 26 and 27 on pages 121, 191 and 200, respectively. (3) The after-tax adjustment to the opening balance of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) represents the reclassification of the unrealized gains (losses) related to several miscellaneous items previously reported in accordance with SFAS 115. The related unrealized gains and losses were reclassified to Retained earnings upon the adoption of the fair value option in accordance with SFAS 159. See Notes 1 and 27 on pages 121 and 200 for further discussions. 32. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Exchange Offer and U.S. Government Exchange On February 27, 2009, Citigroup announced an exchange offer of its common stock for up to $27.5 billion of its existing preferred securities and trust preferred securities at a conversion price of $3.25 per share. The U.S. government will match this exchange up to a maximum of $25 billion of its preferred stock at the same conversion price. These transactions will significantly dilute the existing common stockholders of the Company. As announced, the transactions will increase the Companys tangible common equity (TCE). The transactions will require no additional U.S. government investment in Citigroup and will not change the Companys overall strategy or operations. In addition, the transactions will not change the Companys Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 11.9% as of December 31, 2008. In connection with the transactions, Citigroup will suspend dividends on its preferred securities (other than its trust preferred securities) and, as a result, on its common stock. Full implementation of the proposed exchange offer is subject to approval of Citigroups shareholders, which cannot be guaranteed. Reset of Conversion Terms of the $12.5 Billion Convertible Preferred Stock On January 23, 2009, pursuant to Citibanks prior agreement with the purchasers of the $12.5 billion convertible preferred stock issued in a private offering during 2008, the conversion price was reset from $31.62 per share to $26.35 per share. The reset will result in Citigroup issuing approximately 79 million additional common shares if converted. There will be no impact to net income, total stockholders equity or capital ratios due to the reset. However, the reset will result in a reclassification from retained earnings to additional paid in capital of $1.2 billion to reflect the benefit of the reset to the preferred stockholders. 215 Table of Contents 33.

(Citibank) and other banks makes Citigroup a bank holding company under U.S. law. Bank holding companies are generally limited to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks, and other closely related activities. Citigroup is qualified as a financial holding company, which permits the Company to engage in a broader range of financial activities in the U.S. and abroad. These activities include underwriting and dealing in securities, insurance underwriting and brokerage, and making investments in non-financial companies for a limited period of time, as long as the Company does not manage the non-financial companys day-to-day activities, and the Companys banking subsidiaries engage only in permitted cross-marketing with the non-financial company. If Citigroup ceases to qualify as a financial holding company, it could be barred from new financial activities or acquisitions, and have to discontinue the broader range of activities permitted to financial holding companies. Regulators As a bank holding company, Citigroup is regulated and supervised by the FRB. Nationally chartered subsidiary banks, such as Citibank, are regulated and supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC); federal savings associations by the Office of Thrift Supervision; and state-chartered depository institutions by state banking departments and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC has back-up enforcement authority for banking subsidiaries whose deposits it insures. Overseas branches of Citibank are regulated and supervised by the FRB and OCC and overseas subsidiary banks by the FRB. Such overseas branches and subsidiary banks are also regulated and supervised by regulatory authorities in the host countries. Internal Growth and Acquisitions Unless otherwise required by the FRB, financial holding companies generally can engage, directly or indirectly in the U.S. and abroad, in financial activities, either de novo or by acquisition, by providing after-the-fact notice to the FRB. However, the Company must obtain the prior approval of the FRB before acquiring more than five percent of any class of voting stock of a U.S. depository institution or bank holding company. Subject to certain restrictions and the prior approval of the appropriate federal banking regulatory agency, the Company can acquire U.S. depository institutions, including out-of-state banks. In addition, intrastate bank mergers are permitted and banks in states that do not prohibit out-of-state mergers may merge. A national or state bank can establish a new branch in another state if permitted by the other state, and a federal savings association can generally open new branches in any state. The FRB must approve certain additional capital contributions to an existing non-U.S. investment and certain acquisitions by the Company of an interest in a non-U.S. company, including in a foreign bank, as well as the establishment by Citibank of foreign branches in certain circumstances. Dividends The Companys bank holding companies and banking subsidiaries are limited in their ability to pay dividends. (See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 171.) In addition to specific limitations on the dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies, federal regulators could prohibit a dividend that would be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. It is FRB policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organizations expected future needs and financial condition. Moreover, bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine the companys ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. Transactions with Nonbank Subsidiaries A banking subsidiarys transactions with a holding company or nonbank subsidiary generally are limited to 10% of the banking subsidiarys capital stock and surplus, with an aggregate limit of 20% of the banking subsidiarys capital stock and surplus for all such transactions. Such transactions must be on arms-length terms, and certain credit transactions must be fully secured by approved forms of collateral. Liquidation The Companys right to participate in the distribution of assets of a subsidiary upon the subsidiarys liquidation will be subordinate to the claims of the subsidiarys creditors. If the subsidiary is an insured depository institution, the Companys claim as a stockholder or creditor will be subordinated to the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors. In the liquidation of a U.S. insured depository institution, deposits in U.S. offices and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation will have priority over other general unsecured claims, including deposits in offices outside the U.S., non-deposit claims in all offices, and claims of a parent such as the Company. The FDIC, which succeeds to the position of insured depositors, would be a priority creditor. An FDIC-insured financial institution that is affiliated with a failed FDIC-insured institution may have to indemnify the FDIC for losses resulting from the insolvency of the failed institution, even if this causes the indemnifying institution also to become insolvent. Obligations of a subsidiary depository institution to a parent company are subordinate to the subsidiarys indemnity liability and the claims of its depositors. Other Bank and Bank Holding Company Regulation The Company and its banking subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory limitations, including requirements for banks to maintain reserves against deposits; requirements as to risk based capital and leverage (see Capital Resources and Liquidity on page 94 and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 168); restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged; and limitations on investments that can be made and services that can be offered. 227 Table of Contents The FRB may also expect the Company to commit resources to its subsidiary banks in certain circumstances. However, the FRB may not compel a bank holding company to remove capital from its regulated securities and insurance subsidiaries for this purpose. A U.S. bank is not required to repay a deposit at a branch outside the U.S. if the branch cannot repay the deposit due to an act of war, civil strife, or action taken by the government in the host country. Privacy and Data Security Under U.S. federal law, the Company must disclose its privacy policy to consumers, permit consumers to opt out of having non-public customer information disclosed to third parties, and allow customers to opt out of receiving marketing solicitations based on information about the customer received from another subsidiary. States may adopt more extensive privacy protections. The Company is similarly required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure its proper disposal and to notify customers of unauthorized disclosure, consistent with applicable law or regulation. Non-U.S. Regulation A substantial portion of the Companys revenues is derived from its operations outside the U.S., which are subject to the local laws and regulations of the host country. Those requirements affect how the local activities are organized and the manner in which they are conducted. The Companys foreign activities are thus subject to both U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory requirements and supervision, including U.S. laws prohibiting companies from doing business in certain countries. SECURITIES REGULATION Certain of Citigroups subsidiaries are subject to various securities and commodities regulations and capital adequacy requirements of the regulatory and exchange authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Subsidiaries registrations include as broker-dealer and investment adviser with the SEC and as futures commission merchant and commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Subsidiaries memberships include the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (NYSE) and other principal United States securities exchanges, as well as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the National Futures Association (NFA). Citigroups primary U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI), is registered as a broker-dealer in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Taiwan and Guam. CGMI is also a primary dealer in U.S. Treasury securities and a member of the principal United States futures exchanges. CGMI is subject to extensive regulation, including minimum capital requirements, which are issued and enforced by, among others, the SEC, the CFTC, the NFA, FINRA, the NYSE, various other self-regulatory organizations of which CGMI is a member and the securities administrators of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam. The SEC and the CFTC also require certain registered broker-dealers (including CGMI) to maintain records concerning certain financial and securities activities of affiliated companies that may be material to the broker-dealer, and to file certain financial and other information regarding such affiliated companies. Citigroups securities operations abroad are conducted through various subsidiaries and affiliates, principally Citigroup Global Markets Limited in London and Nikko Citigroup Limited (a joint venture between CGMHI and Nikko Cordial) and Nikko Cordial in Tokyo. Its securities activities in the United Kingdom, which include investment banking, trading, and brokerage services, are subject to the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000, which regulates organizations that conduct investment businesses in the United Kingdom including capital and liquidity requirements, and to the rules of the Financial Services Authority. Nikko Citigroup Limited and Nikko Cordial are registered securities companies in Japan, and as such their activities in Japan are regulated principally by the Financial Services Agency of Japan. These and other subsidiaries of Citigroup are also members of various securities and commodities exchanges and are subject to the rules and regulations of those exchanges. Citigroups other offices abroad are also subject to the jurisdiction of foreign financial services regulatory authorities. CGMI is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which, in the event of the liquidation of a broker-dealer, provides protection for customers securities accounts held by the firm of up to $500,000 for each eligible customer, subject to a limitation of $100,000 for claims for cash balances. To supplement the SIPC coverage, CGMI has purchased for the benefit of its customers additional protection, subject to an aggregate loss limit of $600 million and a per client cash loss limit of up to $1.9 million. Unresolved SEC Staff Comments The Company is in discussion with the SEC in response to comment letters received from the SEC Division of Corporate Finance primarily regarding Goodwill. CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS As a registered broker-dealer, CGMI is subject to the SECs Net Capital Rule. CGMI computes net capital under the alternative method of the Net Capital Rule, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital equal to 2% of aggregate debit items (as defined). A member of the NYSE may be required to reduce its business if its net capital is less than 4% of aggregate debit balances (as defined) and may also be prohibited from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital would be less than 5% of aggregate debit balances. Furthermore, the Net Capital Rule does not permit withdrawal of equity or subordinated capital if the resulting net capital would be less than 5% of such aggregate debit balances. The Net Capital Rule also limits the ability of broker-dealers to transfer large amounts of capital to parent companies and other affiliates. Under the Net Capital Rule, equity capital cannot be withdrawn from a broker-dealer without the prior approval of that broker-dealers designated examining authority (in the case of CGMI, the NYSE) in certain circumstances, including when net capital after the withdrawal would be less than (i) 120% of the minimum net capital required by the Net Capital Rule, or (ii) 25% of the broker-dealers securities position haircuts. Haircuts is the term used for deductions from capital of certain specified percentages of the market value of securities to reflect the possibility of a market decline prior to disposition. In addition, the Net Capital Rule requires broker-dealers to notify the SEC and the appropriate self-regulatory organization two business days before any withdrawals of excess net capital if the withdrawals (in the aggregate over any 30-day period) would exceed the greater of $500,000 or 30% of the broker-dealers excess net capital, and two business days after any 228 Table of Contents withdrawals (in the aggregate over any 30-day period) that exceed the greater of $500,000 or 20% of excess net capital. The Net Capital Rule also authorizes the SEC to order a freeze (for up to 20 business days) on the transfer of capital if a broker-dealer plans a withdrawal of more than 30% of its excess net capital (when aggregated with all other withdrawals during the previous 30 days) and the SEC believes that such a withdrawal may be detrimental to the financial integrity of the broker-dealer or may jeopardize the broker-dealers ability to pay its customers. GENERAL BUSINESS FACTORS In the Companys judgment, no material part of the Companys business depends upon a single customer or group of customers, the loss of which would have a materially adverse effect on the Company, and no one customer or group of affiliated customers accounts for as much as 10% of the Companys consolidated revenues.

Beginning in 2002, Citigroup, CGMI and certain executive officers and current and former employees (along with, in many cases, other investment banks and certain Enron officers and directors, lawyers and/or accountants) were named as defendants in a series of individual and putative class action lawsuits related to Enron. The putative securities class action and all remaining individual actions (other than actions brought as part of Enrons Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding) were consolidated or coordinated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The consolidated securities class action, brought on behalf of a putative class of individuals who purchased Enron securities (NEWBY, ET AL. v. ENRON CORP., ET AL.), alleged violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Sections 10 and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Citigroup agreed to settle this action on June 10, 2005. Under the terms of the settlement, approved by the District Court on May 24, 2006, $2.18 billion was paid to an escrow account for the benefit of the settlement class, which consists of all purchasers of publicly traded equity and debt securities issued by Enron and Enron-related entities between September 9, 1997 and December 2, 2001. The amount paid to settle this action was covered by existing Citigroup litigation reserves. On April 4, 2008, Citigroup announced an agreement to settle actions filed by Enron in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings seeking to recover payments to Citigroup as alleged preferences or fraudulent conveyances, to disallow or equitably subordinate claims of Citigroup and Citigroup transferees on the basis of alleged fraud, and to recover damages from Citigroup for allegedly aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty. Under the terms of the settlement, approved by the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on April 24, 2008, Citigroup made a pretax payment of $1.66 billion to Enron, and waived certain claims against Enrons estate. Enron also allowed specified Citigroup-related claims in the bankruptcy proceeding, including all of the bankruptcy claims of parties holding approximately $2.4 billion of Enron credit-linked notes (CLNs), and released all claims against Citigroup. Citigroup separately agreed to settle an action brought by certain trusts that issued the CLNs in question, by the related indenture trustee and by certain holders of those securities. The amounts paid to settle these actions were covered by existing Citigroup litigation reserves. A number of other individual actions have been settled, including, on January 21, 2009, the parties settled VANGUARD BALANCED INDEX FUND, ET AL. v. CITIGROUP, ET AL., an action filed in 2003 in Pennsylvania state court by certain investment funds, and asserting claims under state securities and common law, arising out of plaintiffs purchase of certain Enron-related securities. The case had been coordinated with NEWBY (discussed above) until it was remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in June 2008. Pursuant to the settlement, the case was voluntarily dismissed on February 4, 2009. Additional actions remain pending against Citigroup and its affiliates and JP Morgan Chase, as co-agents on certain Enron revolving credit facilities. The plaintiffs are commercial banks that participated in the facilities and purchasers of the resulting Enron bank debt on the secondary market. Plaintiffs allege that defendants aided and abetted Enrons fraud, and the breaches of fiduciary duty of Enrons officers, by engaging in transactions that they knew Enron was not properly reporting in its financial statements, and that defendants knew that Enron was in default under various provisions of its credit agreements and fraudulently failed to advise the syndicate members. These cases have been consolidated and are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Research WorldCom, Inc. Beginning in 2002, Citigroup, CGMI and certain executive officers and current and former employees (along with, in many cases, other investment banks, certain WorldCom officers and directors, and/or accountants) were named as defendants in a series of individual and putative class action lawsuits relating to the underwriting of WorldCom securities and the issuance of research analyst reports concerning WorldCom. The putative class action and the majority of the individual actions were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as IN RE WORLDCOM, INC. SECURITIES LITIGATION; certain individual actions remained pending in other state and federal courts. Citigroup settled the consolidated putative class action in May 2004. Citigroup has now settled or obtained dismissal of all but two of the 229 Table of Contents WorldCom-related individual actions. The amount paid to settle these actions was covered by existing Citigroup litigation reserves. One of the two remaining actions, HOLMES, ET AL. v. GRUBMAN, ET AL., was dismissed by the District Court; an appeal is pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Metromedia Fiber Network. Beginning in 2002, Citigroup, CGMI and certain executive officers and current and former employees were named as defendants in a series of putative class action lawsuits, alleging violations of the federal securities laws, including Sections 10 and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with Citigroup research analyst reports. One of these actions, involving Metromedia Fiber Network, Inc. (MFN), IN RE SALOMON ANALYST METROMEDIA LITIGATION, was brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On January 6, 2005, the District Court granted in part and denied in part Citigroups motion to dismiss the claims against it. On June 20, 2006, the District Court certified the plaintiff class in the MFN action. On September 30, 2008, the District Courts class certification decision was vacated on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On October 1, 2008, the parties reached a settlement that was preliminarily approved by the District Court on November 19, 2008. The amount to be paid to settle this action is covered by existing Citigroup litigation reserves. Global Crossing, Ltd. In January 2004, the Global Crossing Estate Representative filed an adversary action in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York against Citigroup and several other banks seeking to rescind the payment of a loan made to a Global Crossing subsidiary. Citigroup moved to dismiss the action in May 2004, and the motion remains pending. On August 20, 2008, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint that narrowed the pending claims. Citigroup has yet to respond to the amended complaint. Disher. In March 2004, a putative research-related customer class action alleging various state law claims arising out of the issuance of allegedly misleading research analyst reports, DISHER v. CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC., was filed in Illinois state court. Citigroup removed this action to federal court, and in August 2005 the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the District Courts August 2004 order remanding the case to state court, and directed the District Court to dismiss plaintiffs claims as preempted. On June 26, 2006, the United States Supreme Court granted plaintiffs petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated the Seventh Circuits opinion and remanded the case to the Seventh Circuit for further proceedings. On January 22, 2007, the Seventh Circuit dismissed Citigroups appeal from the District Courts removal order for lack of appellate jurisdiction. On February 1, 2007, plaintiffs secured an order reopening this case in Illinois state court, and on February 16, Citigroup removed the reopened action to federal court. On May 3, 2007, the District Court remanded the action to Illinois state court, and on June 13, 2007, Citigroup moved in state court to dismiss the action, which motion remains pending. Arbitrations. In addition to the various lawsuits discussed above, similar claims against Citigroup and certain of its affiliates relating to research analyst reports concerning the securities mentioned above, and other securities, are pending in several arbitrations around the country. Parmalat On July 29, 2004, Enrico Bondi, as extraordinary commissioner of Parmalat and other affiliated entities (Bondi), filed a lawsuit in New Jersey state court against Citigroup, Citibank, and certain allegedly controlled Citigroup entities, alleging that the Citigroup defendants participated in fraud committed by the officers and directors of Parmalat and seeking unspecified damages. The action alleged a variety of claims under New Jersey state law, including fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and violations of the New Jersey Fraudulent Transfer Act and the New Jersey RICO statute. After motion practice, the Citigroup defendants answered the complaint and Citibank filed counterclaims alleging causes of action for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conversion and breach of warranty. On April 15, 2008, the court granted the Citigroup defendants motion for summary judgment on all claims, except the claim relating to allegations of aiding and abetting Parmalat insiders in breaching their fiduciary duties to Parmalat, insofar as that claim pertained to the insiders larceny from Parmalat. The court also denied Bondis motion for summary judgment on Citibanks counterclaim. Trial commenced on May 5, 2008. On October 20, 2008, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Citigroup defendants. On Bondis claim, the jury found that the Citigroup defendants were not liable. On Citibanks counterclaims, the jury found in favor of Citibank and awarded damages of $364 million, plus interest and court costs. The court subsequently denied Bondis motions for a new trial on his claim, and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on Citibanks counterclaims. Bondi filed a notice of appeal on January 28, 2009. Citigroup (along with, among others, numerous other investment banks and certain former Parmalat officers and accountants) also is involved in various Parmalat-related proceedings in Italy. In one such action, the Milan prosecutor has obtained the indictments of numerous individuals, including a Citigroup employee, for offenses under Italian law that arise out of the collapse of Parmalat. The trial in this action commenced on January 22, 2008, and is ongoing. In connection with this proceeding, the Milan prosecutor may seek administrative remedies against Citigroup. In addition, a number of private parties, including former investors in Parmalat securities, have applied to join the Milan proceedings as civil claimants and are seeking unspecified civil damages against numerous parties, including the Citigroup defendants. In Parma, a public prosecutor is conducting a criminal investigation into alleged bankruptcy offenses relating to the collapse of Parmalat. In December 2007, the prosecutor notified 12 current and former Citigroup employees that he is seeking their indictment. A preliminary hearing on the alleged offenses with respect to these Citigroup employees began on April 21, 2008, and is ongoing. On October 8, 2008, the Italian Court issued an order permitting Parmalat investors to proceed with civil claims against Citigroup, subject to proper service of a summons on Citigroup. Additionally, Bondi has attempted to file a civil complaint against Citigroup in the context of the Parma proceedings, seeking 14 billion Euro in damages. The Italian Court directed him to serve the complaint, which he did in November 2008.

On September 30 and October 28, 2008, Citigroup, certain Citigroup entities, certain current and former directors and officers of Citigroup and Citigroup Funding, Inc., and certain underwriters of Citigroup notes (including CGMI) were named as defendants in two putative class actions filed in New York state court but since removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

The Adelphia Recovery Trust, which has replaced the committees as the plaintiff in the action, has filed an amended complaint on behalf of the Adelphia Estate, consolidating the two prior complaints; motions to dismiss the amended complaint and answers have been filed. In addition, CGMI was among the underwriters named in civil actions brought by investors in Adelphia debt securities in connection with Adelphia securities offerings between September 1997 and October 2001. Following settlements of the class action, which is pending appeal, and other individual actions, two cases remain outstanding. The Second Circuit is considering whether the plaintiff in one has proper standing to sue. In September 2007, motions to dismiss in the other case were granted in part and denied in part. IPO Securities Litigation In April 2002, consolidated amended complaints were filed against CGMI and other investment banks named in numerous putative class actions filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging violations of certain federal securities laws (including Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) with respect to the allocation of shares for certain initial public offerings, related aftermarket transactions and damage to investors caused by allegedly biased research analyst reports. 233 Table of Contents Defendants motion to dismiss was denied. On October 13, 2004, the court granted in part the motion to certify class actions for six focus cases in the securities litigation. CGMI is not a defendant in any of the six focus cases. In December 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court and held that the classes could not be certified. Plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing in January 2007; that petition was denied, and the case was remanded to the lower court. Plaintiffs filed amended pleadings in August 2007 and a new motion for class certification in September 2007. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended pleadings in November 2007 and filed an opposition to the new motion for class certification in December 2007. On March 26, 2008, the Southern District of New York denied in part and granted in part Defendants motions to dismiss the amended complaints. Following mediation, a settlement in principle has been reached, subject to negotiation of definitive documentation and court approval. Interchange Fees Citigroup Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries are defendants, together with Visa, MasterCard, and various other banks, in actions filed on behalf of a putative class of retail merchants that accept Visa and MasterCard payment cards. The first of these actions was filed in June 2005, and the lawsuits were subsequently consolidated for pretrial proceedings, together with related lawsuits brought by individual plaintiffs against Visa and MasterCard, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the caption In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Litigation. On April 24, 2006, putative class plaintiffs filed a First Consolidated and Amended Class Action Complaint (Consolidated Complaint). The Consolidated Complaint alleges, among other things, that Defendants have engaged in conspiracies to set the price of interchange and merchant discount fees on credit and off-line debit card transactions, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and a California statute. The complaint also alleges additional federal antitrust violations by Defendants of Section 1 and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including alleged unlawful contracts in restraint of trade pertaining to various rules governing merchant conduct maintained by Visa or MasterCard and alleged unlawful maintenance of monopoly power by Visa and its member banks. The District Court granted Defendants motion to dismiss all claims for damages that pre-date January 1, 2004. On May 22, 2006, the putative class plaintiffs filed a supplemental complaint against MasterCard and certain other bank defendants, including Citigroup Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that MasterCards initial public offering (IPO) in 2006 violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The supplemental complaint also alleged that the MasterCard IPO was a fraudulent conveyance under New York state law. The defendants to the supplemental complaint filed a motion to dismiss its claims, which the District Court granted, with leave to amend. On January 29, 2009, plaintiffs filed an amended supplemental complaint challenging MasterCards IPO, and also filed (1) a supplemental complaint challenging Visas IPO on similar grounds, and (2) a second amended consolidated complaint, adding claims related to (a) alleged continuing violations of the antitrust laws by all defendants after the Visa and MasterCard IPOs, (b) PIN debit transactions on the Visa network and (c) alleged unlawful maintenance of monopoly power by MasterCard and its member banks. Plaintiffs motion for class certification, filed on May 8, 2008, remains pending. Wachovia/Wells Fargo Litigation On September 29, 2008, Citigroup Inc. announced that it had reached an agreement-in-principle to acquire all of the banking subsidiaries of Wachovia Corporation (Wachovia) in an open-bank transaction assisted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. On October 3, 2008, Wachovia announced that it had entered into an agreement with Wells Fargo & Co. (Wells Fargo) for Wells Fargo to purchase Wachovia. Since October 4, 2008, litigation has been instigated by all three parties and others in various courts, including the New York State Supreme Court and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In this litigation, Citigroup seeks compensatory and punitive damages from Wachovia and Wells Fargo and their respective directors and advisors on various claims, including violation of a binding exclusivity agreement (the Exclusivity Agreement) between Citigroup and Wachovia; tortious interference with the Exclusivity Agreement; and unjust enrichment. Wachovia and Wells Fargo seek, among other relief, a declaration that the Wells Fargo-Wachovia transaction is valid and proper and not prohibited by the Exclusivity Agreement. Other Matters Leber. In October 2007, a purported class action complaint, LEBER v. CITIGROUP INC., ET AL., was filed against Citigroup and its administration and investment committees, alleging that they engaged in prohibited transactions and breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by authorizing or causing the Citigroup 401(k) Plan to invest in Citigroup-affiliated mutual funds and to purchase services from Citigroup-affiliated entities. On July 18, 2008, plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint. On August 29, 2008, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On October 31, 2008, plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a class of all participants in the Citigroup 401(k) Plan from 2001 through the present. Pension Plan Litigation. Beginning in June 2005, certain participants in the Citigroup Pension Plan filed putative class action complaints against the Citigroup Pension Plan and other Citigroup defendants, alleging violations of ERISA. In September 2005, the claims were consolidated as IN RE CITIGROUP PENSION PLAN ERISA LITIGATION in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint alleging, among other things, that (i) the Citigroup Pension Plan is impermissibly backloaded due to insufficient interest credits, (ii) the Citigroup Pension Plans fractional test method of computing accrued benefits is precluded under ERISA, (iii) the Citigroup Pension Plan illegally discriminates based on age, and (iv) Citigroup Pension Plan participants were not provided proper notice that the 2000 and 2002 cash balance amendments would reduce the rate of future benefit accrual. In December 2006, the District Court denied defendants summary judgment motion, granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on their backloading, age discrimination and notice claims, and ordered the Citigroup Pension Plan reformed to comply with ERISA. The District Court also granted plaintiffs motion for class certification. In November 2007, the District Court: (i) ordered that defendants fix the Citigroup Pension Plans unlawful backloading by increasing pay credits, (ii) denied plaintiffs request for additional relief on their backloading claims, (iii) denied plaintiffs request for relief on their notice claims, and (iv) reserved its rulings on the proper remedy, if any, for the Citigroup Pension Plans violation of ERISAs ban on age discrimination. In January 2008, the District Court entered a 234 Table of Contents partial final judgment on the backloading and notice claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) and stayed the judgment pending appeal. Defendants filed a notice of appeal on January 22, 2008, and plaintiffs cross appealed on January 30, 2008; oral argument is scheduled for March 2009. 27001 Partnership, et al. v. BT Securities Corp., et al. In December 2004, 46 individual purchasers of 10-1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes (the Notes) issued in 1995 in connection with the leveraged recapitalization of Brunos Inc. sued the underwriters of the Notes, including Salomon Brothers, Inc., together with Brunos auditors, in Alabama state court. Plaintiffs brought state law claims arising out of, among other things, alleged material misrepresentations and omissions in the Prospectus issued in connection with the offering. The case was filed following the prior dismissal, after years of motion practice, of a lawsuit brought in April 2000 by the investment advisor to these 46 plaintiffs on behalf of its clients, which alleged identical claims against defendants. Plaintiffs allege that they purchased $190 million of the Notes and seek compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys fees and costs. After the commencement of the case in 2004, the parties engaged in extensive procedural motion practice, which resulted in the dismissal of several defendants on October 14, 2005. Discovery is ongoing and trial is currently scheduled to commence in February 2010. Settlement Payments Payments required in settlement agreements described above have been made or are covered by existing litigation reserves. ******** Additional lawsuits containing claims similar to those described above may be filed in the future. 235 Table of Contents UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Share Repurchases Under its long-standing repurchase program, the Company buys back common shares in the market or otherwise from time to time.
