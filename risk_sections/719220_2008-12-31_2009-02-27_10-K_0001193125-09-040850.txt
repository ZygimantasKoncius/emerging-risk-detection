Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  continued If S&T does not adjust to changes in the financial services industry, its financial performance may suffer. S&Ts future financial performance will depend in part on its ability to adjust to the changes in the financial services industry that are expected as a result of the financial crisis. These adjustments may include expanding its scope of available financial services to its customers, and in adjusting products and services to meet current economic conditions and comply with new federal laws and regulations. In addition to other banks, competitors include security dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, and finance and insurance companies. The current environment is, in part, a result of the overall decline in economic activity, the absence of liquidity in the markets, changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, and continued consolidation among financial service providers. Interest rate movements impact the earnings of S&T. S&T is exposed to interest rate risk, through the operations of its banking subsidiary, since substantially all of S&T Banks assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Interest rate risk arises from market driven fluctuations in interest rates that affect cash flows, income, expense and value of financial instruments. S&T Banks earnings, like that of most financial institutions, largely depend on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. In an increasing interest rate environment, the cost of funds sometimes increases more rapidly than the interest earned on the loans and securities because the primary source of funds are deposits with generally shorter maturities than the maturities on loans and investment securities. This could cause the net interest rate spread to compress and negatively impact S&T Banks profitability. S&Ts business strategy includes growth plans through internal growth and acquisitions. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. S&T intends to continue pursuing a profitable growth strategy. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in growth stages of development. We cannot assure you that we will be able to expand our market presence in our existing markets or successfully enter new markets or that any such expansion will not adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Also, if we grow more slowly than anticipated, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market areas and our ability to manage our growth. There can be no assurance that growth opportunities will be available or that growth will be successfully managed. Item 1B.
