ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We make forward-looking statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other reports we file with the SEC. In addition, members of our senior management make forward-looking statements orally in presentations to analysts, investors, the media and others. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our objectives and expectations with respect to our financial plan, sales and earnings, merchandising and marketing strategies, acquisitions and dispositions, share repurchases, store opening, renovation, remodeling and expansion, inventory management and performance, liquidity and cash flows, capital structure, capital expenditures, development of our information technology and telecommunications plans and related management information systems, e-commerce initiatives, human resource initiatives and other statements regarding our plans and objectives. In addition, the words "plans to," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "intend," "expect," "believe," "forecast," "can," "could," "should," "will," "may," or similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but some of these statements may use other phrasing. These forward-looking statements are intended to relay our expectations about the future, and speak only as of the date they are made. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise publicly or otherwise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events, new information or future circumstances. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and a variety of factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the anticipated or expected results expressed in or suggested by these forward-looking statements. If the general economy performs poorly, discretionary spending on goods that are, or are perceived to be "luxuries" may not grow and may even decrease. Jewelry purchases are discretionary and may be affected by adverse trends in the general economy (and consumer perceptions of those trends). In addition, a number of other factors affecting consumers such as employment, wages and salaries, business conditions, energy costs, credit availability and taxation policies, for the economy as a whole and in regional and local markets where we operate, can impact sales and earnings. The concentration of a substantial portion of our sales in three relatively brief selling periods means that our performance is more susceptible to disruptions. A substantial portion of our sales are derived from three selling periodsÂ—Holiday (Christmas), Valentine's Day and Mother's Day. Because of the briefness of these three selling periods, the opportunity for sales to recover in the event of a disruption or other difficulty is limited, and the impact of disruptions and difficulties can be significant. For instance, adverse weather (such as a blizzard or hurricane), a significant interruption in the receipt of products (whether because of vendor or other product problems), or a sharp decline in mall traffic occurring during one of these selling periods could materially impact sales for the affected period and, because of the importance of each of these selling periods, commensurately impact overall sales and earnings. Most of our sales are of products that include diamonds, precious metals and other commodities. Fluctuations in the availability and pricing of commodities could impact our ability to obtain and produce products at favorable prices, and consumer awareness regarding the issue of "conflict diamonds" may affect consumer demand for diamonds. The supply and price of diamonds in the principal world market are significantly influenced by a single entity, which has traditionally controlled the marketing of a substantial majority of the world's supply of diamonds and sells rough diamonds to worldwide diamond cutters at prices determined in its sole discretion. The availability of diamonds also is somewhat dependent on the political conditions in diamond-producing countries and on the continuing supply of raw diamonds. Any sustained interruption in this supply could have an adverse affect on our business. 9 We also are affected by fluctuations in the price of diamonds, gold and other commodities. A significant change in prices of key commodities could adversely affect our business by reducing operating margins or decreasing consumer demand if retail prices are increased significantly. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations impact costs and cash flows associated with our Canadian operations and the acquisition of inventory from international vendors. Our sales are dependent upon mall traffic. Our stores and kiosks are located primarily in shopping malls throughout the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Our success is in part dependent upon the continued popularity of malls as a shopping destination and the ability of malls, their tenants and other mall attractions to generate customer traffic. Accordingly, a significant decline in this popularity, especially if it is sustained, would substantially harm our sales and earnings. We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry. The retail jewelry business is highly competitive and fragmented, and we compete with nationally recognized jewelry chains as well as a large number of independent regional and local jewelry retailers and other types of retailers who sell jewelry and gift items, such as department stores and mass merchandisers. We also compete with internet sellers of jewelry. Because of the breadth and depth of this competition, we are constantly under competitive pressure that both constrains pricing and requires extensive merchandising efforts in order for us to remain competitive. Any failure by us to manage our inventory effectively will negatively impact sales and earnings. We purchase much of our inventory well in advance of each selling period. In the event we misjudge consumer preferences or demand, we will experience lower sales than expected and will have excessive inventory that may need to be written down in value or sold at prices that are less than expected. Because of our dependence upon a small concentrated number of landlords for a substantial number of our locations, any significant erosion of our relationships with those landlords would negatively impact our ability to obtain and retain store locations. We are significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs that allow us to earn a reasonable return on our locations. We depend on the leasing market and our landlords to determine supply, demand, lease cost and operating costs and conditions. We cannot be certain as to when or whether desirable store locations will become or remain available to us at reasonable lease and operating costs. Further, several large landlords dominate the ownership of prime malls, and we are dependent upon maintaining good relations with those landlords in order to obtain and retain store locations on optimal terms. From time to time, we do have disagreements with our landlords and a significant disagreement, if not resolved, could have an adverse impact on our business. Changes in regulatory requirements relating to the extension of credit may increase the cost of or adversely affect our operations. Our operations are affected by numerous U.S. and Canadian federal and state or provincial laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing and enforcement of credit accounts and limitations on the maximum aggregate amount of finance charges that may be charged by a credit provider. Any change in the regulation of credit (including changes in the application of current laws) which would materially limit the availability of credit to our customer base could adversely affect our sales and earnings. 10 Any disruption in, or changes to, our private label credit card arrangement with Citibank, N.A. may adversely affect our ability to provide consumer credit and write credit insurance. Our agreement with Citibank, N.A., which provides financing for our customers to purchase merchandise through private label credit cards, enhances our ability to provide consumer credit and write credit insurance. Any disruption in, or change to, this agreement could have an adverse effect on our business, especially to the extent that it materially limits credit availability to our customer base. Acquisitions and dispositions involve special risk, including the risk that we may not be able to complete proposed acquisitions or dispositions or that such transactions may not be beneficial to us. We have made significant acquisitions and dispositions in the past and may in the future make additional acquisitions and dispositions. Difficulty integrating an acquisition into our existing infrastructure and operations may cause us to fail to realize expected return on investment through revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence and customer reach, and/or other projected benefits from the acquisition. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated cost savings or may be unable to find attractive investment opportunities for funds received in connection with a disposition. Additionally, attractive acquisition or disposition opportunities may not be available at the time or pursuant to terms acceptable to us and we may be unable to complete acquisitions or dispositions. We currently are contingently liable for substantially all of the store operating leases associated with the Bailey Banks & Biddle brand that was sold in November 2007. As those leases are extended, or materially amended, we generally will be released from our contingent obligation. If the purchaser of Bailey Banks & Biddle fails to perform under the leases, we could be liable for any remaining amounts due under the leases, which could be a significant amount and would negatively impact our earnings and financial condition.
