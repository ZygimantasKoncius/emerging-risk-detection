Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as all of the information in this Report and our other past and future filings with the SEC, in evaluating and understanding us and our business. Additional risks not presently known or that we currently deem immaterial may also impact our business operations and the risks identified below may adversely affect our business in ways we do not currently anticipate. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Risks Related to Our Business If we fail to obtain, on a timely basis, the additional financing necessary to fund the procurement and deployment of our second-generation constellation and other related construction costs and ongoing operations, which are generating negative cash flows, we may not be able to continue as a going concern. We must obtain additional financing to fund the procurement and deployment of our second-generation constellation and other related construction costs and our on-going operations, which are currently generating negative cash flows. Due to the worldwide economic crisis and the tight credit market, obtaining suitable financing remains challenging. Our registered public accounting firm's audit report on our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008, and for the year then ended includes a "going concern" explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The "going concern" explanatory paragraph reflects substantial doubt about our ability to obtain this financing in a timely manner. We are pursuing a number of options involving issuance of additional debt, equity or both to obtain the required funding as well as seeking 19 Table of Contents to reduce our internal costs and aggressively grow our revenues. We cannot assure you that the necessary additional financing will be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all. If we fail to obtain the necessary additional financing in a timely manner, the construction of our second-generation satellite constellation, related construction costs and our ongoing operations will be materially adversely impacted. We could default on our commitments to our satellite, launch, ground facilities and other third party vendors, possibly leading to termination of our second-generation construction contracts or other contracts, some of which have substantial termination fees. We may also be required to reduce substantially our ongoing operations or discontinue operations altogether. If we do not procure and deploy our second generation constellation and/or discontinue operations, we may lose our FCC license, international spectrum rights and/or ATC authority in the United States. If we lose our FCC license, rights to international spectrum or ATC authority, we will lose the right to operate our business in those parts of the world and may not be able to continue as a going concern and would be required to sell our satellite business or assets in those areas of the world or cease operations all together. In addition, we may have difficulty maintaining existing relationships, or developing new relationships, with suppliers or vendors as a result of our financial condition. Our suppliers or vendors could choose to provide supplies or services to us on more stringent payment terms than those currently in place, such as by requiring advance payment or payment upon delivery of such supplies or services, which would have an adverse impact on our short-term cash flows. As a result, our ability to retain current customers, attract new customers and maintain contracts that are critical to our operations may be adversely affected. Finally, these events may result in defaults under our current financing arrangements which would permit acceleration of our indebtedness and exercise of remedies by our lenders. We have a short operating history. Our predecessor incurred substantial losses. Our operating results have fluctuated, with operating losses in three of the last five years, and may continue to do so. We acquired the assets of Old Globalstar in December 2003 in a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code. Prior to that time, Old Globalstar incurred substantial losses, including operating losses of $260.7 million in 2003. Since our acquisition of the Globalstar business, we incurred an operating loss of $3.5 million in 2004, had operating profits of $21.9 million in 2005 and $15.7 million in 2006, and incurred an operating loss of $24.6 million in 2007. Largely as a result of problems with our two-way communications services, we incurred an operating loss of $57.7 million in 2008. We expect that our operating results will continue to be volatile, at least until we have deployed and placed into service our second-generation satellite constellation. Our satellites have a limited life and some have failed, which causes our network to be compromised and which materially and adversely affects our business, prospects and profitability. Since the first Old Globalstar satellites were launched in 1998, ten satellites have failed in orbit and have been retired, and we expect others to fail in the future. We consider a satellite "failed" only when it can no longer provide any communications service, and we do not intend to undertake any further efforts to return it to service. Six of these satellite failures have been attributed to anomalies of the S-band antenna. In-orbit failure may result from various causes, including component failure, loss of power or fuel, inability to control positioning of the satellite, solar or other astronomical events, including solar radiation and flares, the quality of construction, gradual degradation of solar panels, the durability of components, and collision with other satellites or space debris. Radiation induced failure of satellite components may result in damage to or loss of a satellite before the end of its currently expected life. As a result of the issues described above, some of our in-orbit satellites may not be fully functioning at any given time. As discussed below, all of our current satellites launched before 2007 20 Table of Contents have experienced degradation or failures of some type, mainly of their S-band downlink communications capabilities. Except for the ten satellites that have been decommissioned, this does not impair their ability to continue to support Simplex data transmissions in the L-band, and accordingly, we do not classify them as "failed." Although we do not incur any direct cash costs related to the failure of a satellite, if a satellite fails, we record an impairment charge reflecting its net book value. There are some remote tools we use to remedy certain types of problems affecting the performance of our satellites, but the physical repair of satellites in space is not feasible. We do not insure our satellites against in-orbit failures, whether such failures are caused by internal or external factors. S-band Antenna Amplifier Degradation The degradation of the S-band antenna amplifier in our satellites launched prior to 2007, has negatively affected our ability to provide two-way voice and data communications at all times and in all locations. The S-band antenna provides the downlink from the satellite to a subscriber's phone or data terminal. Degraded performance of the S-band antenna reduces the call completion rate for two-way voice and data communication between the affected satellites and the subscriber and may reduce the duration of a call. When the S-band antenna on a satellite ceases to be functional, two-way communication is impossible over that satellite, but not for simplex service and over the constellation as a whole. The root cause of the degradation in performance of the S-band antenna amplifiers is unknown, although we believe it may result from the satellites being exposed to radiation over their life in orbit. The S-band antenna amplifier degradation does not affect adversely our one-way Simplex data transmission services, which utilize only the L-band uplink from a subscriber's Simplex terminal to the satellites. In the past, we have reconfigured our constellation and placed less impaired satellites into key orbital positions to maximize our capacity and quality of service. We will continue to do this. We forecast the time and duration of two-way service coverage at any particular location in our service area, and we have made this information available without charge to our customers and service providers, including our wholly owned operating subsidiaries, value added resellers, and IGO's, so that they may work with their subscribers to reduce the impact of the service interruptions in their respective service areas. Nonetheless, we expect the S-band antenna amplifier degradation to continue as our satellites age in orbit. Substantially all of our in-orbit satellites launched prior to 2007 have ceased to be able to provide two-way communications as a result of this degradation. Accordingly, as the number of in-orbit satellites (other than the eight spare satellites launched in 2007) with properly functioning S-band antenna amplifiers has decreased, even with optimized placement in orbit of the eight spare satellites, increasingly larger coverage gaps have occurred and will continue to occur over areas in which we have provided two-way communications service. This has materially adversely affected our ability to attract new subscribers and maintain our existing subscribers for our two-way communications services, equipment sales of two-way communication devices, retail average revenue per unit, or ARPU, and our results of operations and is likely to have a further material adverse effect on each of these in the future. If our subscriber base declines, our ability to attract and retain subscribers at higher rates when our second-generation constellation is placed in service may be affected adversely. During 2008, our ARPU decreased by 24% to $35.19 from $46.26 in 2007. In addition, our service revenue declined from $78.3 million to $61.8 million. We believe that customer reaction to the S-band antenna amplifier degradation and our related price reductions have been the primary causes of the reductions in service revenue. If we are unable to maintain our customer base for two-way communications service, our business and profitability may be further materially and adversely affected. In addition, after our second-generation satellite constellation becomes operational, we may face 21 Table of Contents challenges in maintaining our current subscriber base for two-way communications service because we plan then to increase prices, consistent with market conditions, to reflect our improved two-way service and coverage. Our business plan includes exploiting our ATC license in the United States by combining ATC services with our existing business. If we are unable to accomplish this effectively, our anticipated future revenues and profitability will be reduced and we will lose our investment in developing ATC services. The FCC licenses us to use a portion of our spectrum to provide ATC services in the United States in combination with our existing communication services. If we can integrate ATC services with our existing business, which will require us to make satisfactory arrangements with terrestrial wireless or other communications service providers, we will be able to use the spectrum currently licensed to us to provide an integrated telecommunications offering incorporating both our satellite and ground station system and a terrestrial-based cellular-like system. If successful, this will allow us to address a broader market for our products and services, thereby increasing our revenue and profitability and the value of our business. However, neither we nor any other company has yet successfully integrated a commercial ATC service with satellite services, and we may be unable to do so. Northern Sky Research estimates that development of an independent terrestrial network to provide ATC services could cost $2.5 to $3.0 billion in the United States alone. We do not expect to have sufficient capital resources to develop independently the terrestrial component of an ATC network. Therefore, in the foreseeable future full exploitation of our ATC opportunity will require us to lease portions of our ATC-licensed spectrum to, or form satisfactory partnerships, service contracts, joint ventures or other arrangements with, other telecommunications or spectrum-based service providers. We have entered into an ATC lease agreement with Open Range Communications Inc. We may not be able to establish additional arrangements to exploit our ATC authority at all or on favorable terms and, if such arrangements are established, the other parties may not fulfill their obligations. If we are unable to form additional suitable partnerships or enter into service contracts, joint venture agreements or additional leases, we may not be able to capitalize fully on our plan to deploy ATC services, which would limit our ability to expand our business and reduce our revenues and profitability, and adversely affect the value of our ATC license. In addition, in such event we will lose any resources we have invested in developing ATC services, which may be substantial. The FCC rules governing ATC are relatively new and are subject to interpretation. The scope of ATC services that we will be permitted and required to provide under our existing FCC license is unclear and we may be required to seek additional amendments to our ATC license to execute our business plan. The FCC's rules require ATC service providers to demonstrate that their mobile satellite and ATC services satisfy certain gating criteria, such as constituting an "integrated service offering," and maintain at least one in-orbit spare satellite. The FCC reserves the right to rescind ATC authority if the FCC determines that a licensee has failed to provide an "integrated service offering" or to comply with other gating criteria. It is therefore possible that we could lose our existing or future ATC authority, in which case we could lose all or much of our investment in developing ATC services, as well as future revenues from such services. The development and operation of our ATC system may also infringe on unknown and unidentified intellectual property rights of other persons, which could require us to modify our business plan, thereby increasing our development costs and slowing our time to market. If we are unable to meet the regulatory requirements applicable to ATC services or develop or acquire the required technology, we may not be able to realize our plan to offer ATC services, which would decrease our revenues and profitability. 22 Table of Contents Implementation of our business plan depends on increased demand for wireless communications services via satellite, both for our existing services and products and for new services and products. If this increased demand does not occur, our revenues and profitability may not increase as we expect. Demand for wireless communication services via satellite may not grow, or may even shrink, either generally or in particular geographic markets, for particular types of services or during particular time periods. A lack of demand could impair our ability to sell our services and to develop and successfully market new services, or could exert downward pressure on prices, or both. This, in turn, could decrease our revenues and profitability and adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues and profitability over time. The success of our business plan will depend on a number of factors, including: the level of market acceptance and demand for all of our services; our ability to introduce new products and services that meet this market demand; our ability to retain our existing voice and duplex data customers until we have launched our second-generation satellite constellation; our ability to obtain additional business using our existing spectrum resources both in the United States and internationally; our ability to control the costs of developing an integrated network providing related products and services; our ability to market successfully our new Simplex products and services, especially our SPOT satellite messenger products and services; our ability to develop and deploy innovative network management techniques to permit mobile devices to transition between satellite and terrestrial modes; our ability to limit the effects of further degradation of, and to maintain the capacity and control of, our existing satellite network; our ability to sell the equipment inventory on hand and under commitment to purchase from QUALCOMM; our ability to complete the construction, delivery and launch of our second-generation satellites and, once launched, our ability to maintain their health, capacity and control; the effectiveness of our competitors in developing and offering similar products and services and in persuading our customers to switch service providers; and with the addition of our retail product line, general economic conditions that affect consumer discretionary spending and consumer confidence, which have declined sharply in the current recession. The implementation of our business plan and our ability to return to profitability assumes that we are able to generate sufficient revenue and cash flow as our existing satellite constellation continues to age, and to deploy successfully our second-generation satellite constellation, both of which are contingent on a number of factors. As a result of the factors described above, our customers currently are unable to access our two-way communications service at all times and places. Our ability to generate revenue and positive cash flow, at least until our second- generation satellite constellation is deployed and begins to generate revenue, will depend upon several factors, including: whether we can maintain a sufficient number of our existing two-way communications service customers; 23 Table of Contents whether we can introduce successfully new product and service offerings; and whether we can continue to compete successfully against other mobile satellite service providers. Our ability to generate revenue and cash flow has been adversely impacted by our need to reduce our prices for two-way communications services as we seek to maintain our customer base in the face of the challenges to our two-way services. We have recently implemented a new pricing strategy in the United States and Canada designed to stem further diminution of revenue from two-way services described above. Further, our business plan and our ability to return to profitability assume that we will be able to deploy successfully our second-generation satellite constellation. In order to do so, we are dependent on third parties, such as Thales Alenia Space and our Launch Provider, to build and launch our satellites. The construction of these satellites is technically complex and subject to construction and delivery delays that could result from a variety of causes, including the failure of third-party vendors to perform as anticipated and changes in the technical specifications of the satellites. Although we have entered into contracts with Thales Alenia Space that anticipate launch of our second-generation satellites beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, and we have arranged with Thales Alenia Space for acceleration of a portion of the initial 24 satellites by up to four months, there can be no assurance that the delivery of these satellites will be timely. We have not arranged an alternative source if Thales Alenia Space is unable or unwilling to fulfill these contracts. If Thales Alenia Space fails to deliver these initial satellites in a timely manner, our ability to meet our projected launch schedule would be materially adversely affected, and our operations and business plan, which assume a functioning second-generation satellite constellation by 2010, would be materially adversely affected. We have filed an application with the FCC to modify our constellation license to take account of the technical improvements in our second-generation satellites and to change our approved orbital configuration. There is some risk that the FCC will not grant our application as filed, in which case we might not be able to re-establish our duplex services as soon as planned. During any significant delay in placing new satellites into commercial service, we would not be generating the cash flow expected from our constellation to fund its completion (including procuring replacement satellites) by 2014, and we may be unable to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the event of a significant delay. A satellite delivery delay could also require rescheduling of the anticipated launch dates, and alternative launch slots may not be available within a reasonable period of time, which would also have a material adverse affect on our operations and financial condition. We depend in large part on the efforts of third parties for the retail sale of our services and products. The inability of these third parties to sell our services and products successfully may decrease our revenue and profitability. For each of 2008 and 2007, we derived approximately 86% of our revenue from products and services sold through independent agents, dealers and resellers, including, outside the United States, independent gateway operators. If these third parties are unable to market our products and services successfully, our revenue and profitability may decrease. We depend on independent gateway operators to market our services in important regions around the world. If the independent gateway operators are unable to do this successfully, we will not be able to grow our business in those areas as rapidly as we expect. Although we derive most of our revenue from retail sales to end users in the United States, Canada, a portion of Western Europe, Central America and the northern portion of South America, either directly or through agents, dealers and resellers, we depend on independent gateway operators to purchase, install, operate and maintain gateway equipment, to sell phones and data user terminals, and to market our services in other regions where these independent gateway operators hold exclusive or 24 Table of Contents non-exclusive rights. Not all of the independent gateway operators have been successful and, in some regions, they have not initiated service or sold as much usage as originally anticipated. Some of the independent gateway operators are not earning revenues sufficient to fund their operating costs. If they are unable to continue in business, we will lose the revenue we receive for selling equipment to them and providing services to their customers. Although we have implemented a strategy for the acquisition of certain independent gateway operators when circumstances permit, we may not be able to continue to implement this strategy on favorable terms and may not be able to realize the additional efficiencies that we anticipate from this strategy. In some regions it is impracticable to acquire the independent gateway operators either because local regulatory requirements or business or cultural norms do not permit an acquisition, because the expected revenue increase from an acquisition would be insufficient to justify the transaction, or because the independent gateway operator will not sell at a price acceptable to us. In those regions, our revenue and profits may be adversely affected if those independent gateway operators do not fulfill their own business plans to increase substantially their sales of services and products. Our success in generating sufficient cash from operations to fund a portion of the cost of our second-generation satellite constellation will depend in part on the market acceptance and success of our SPOT satellite messenger and other Simplex products and services, which may not occur. In 2007, we launched new products to expand the scope of our Simplex services. On November 1, 2007, we introduced the SPOT satellite messenger, aimed at both recreational and commercial customers who require personal tracking, emergency location and messaging solutions that operate beyond the range of traditional terrestrial and wireless communications. Although we now have more than a year's experience distributing our SPOT satellite messenger, we cannot predict with certainty the potential longer term demand for the services we offer or the extent to which we will be able to meet that demand. A survey has assessed the potential addressable market for SPOT satellite messenger products and services in North America at 50 million units, but the actual size of the market is unknown and subject to significant uncertainty. Our objective is to capture 2-3% of that market in the next few years, but we cannot assure you that we will reach that goal. Demand for our Simplex offerings in general, in particular geographic markets, for particular types of services or during particular time periods may not enable us to generate sufficient positive cash flow to fund a portion of the cost of our second-generation satellite constellation. Among other things, end user acceptance of our Simplex offerings will depend upon: the actual size of the addressable market; our ability to provide attractive service offerings at competitive prices to our target markets; the cost and availability of user equipment, including the data modems that operate on our network; the effectiveness of our competitors in developing and offering alternate technologies or lower priced services; and general and local economic conditions. Our business plan assumes a rapidly growing subscriber base for Simplex products. If we cannot implement this business plan successfully and gain market acceptance for these planned Simplex products and services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. 25 Table of Contents Because consumers will use SPOT satellite messenger products and services in isolated and, in some cases, dangerous locations, we cannot predict whether users of the device who suffer injury or death may seek to assert claims against us alleging failure of the device to facilitate timely emergency response. Although we will seek to limit our exposure to any such claims through appropriate disclaimers and liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure investors that the disclaimers will be effective, claims will not arise or insurance coverage will be sufficient. We have incurred substantial contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding contractual obligations of over $1.27 billion (a majority of which is denominated in Euros) related to the procurement and deployment of our second-generation satellite constellation and related ground installations, the purchase of mobile phones and related equipment and other contractual obligations. The nature of these purchases requires us to enter into long-term fixed price contracts. We could cancel some of these purchase commitments, subject to the incurrence of specified cancellation penalties. We do not currently have and have not arranged all of the funds necessary to fulfill these purchase commitments and may not be able to obtain them. In addition, our cost of services is comprised primarily of network operating costs, which are generally fixed in nature. Accordingly, we are generally unable to adjust our operating costs or capital expenditures to match fluctuations in our revenue. We must raise additional capital in order to complete our second-generation satellite constellation. We estimate the capital costs of procuring and deploying our second-generation satellite constellation and related upgrades to be approximately $1.26 billion (at a weighted average conversion rate of €1.00=$1.3151 and excluding launch costs for the second 24 satellites, internal costs and capitalized interest). As of December 31, 2008, we had incurred approximately $514.4 million (excluding internal costs, capitalized interest but including $43.5 million which is held in escrow pursuant to the contract for the procurement of our second-generation satellite constellation to secure our payment obligations under that contract) of this amount. We estimate approximately $531.3 million (excluding launch costs related to the second batch of 24 satellites) will be incurred from January 1, 2009 through the third quarter of 2010, when we anticipate the launching of 24 second-generation satellites to be completed. We plan to fund approximately $55.8 million of this amount from cash on hand (including our restricted funds held in escrow as described above) and approximately $509.8 million with cash from other sources including but not limited to the sale of debt, equity or a combination of both or cash flow from operations, if positive. Our cash needs could increase depending on, for example, our operational requirements and continued declines in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. Our cash flow from operations was negative in 2007 and 2008, and we expect this to continue in 2009. Our ability to generate any portion of the required $1.26 billion (at a weighted average conversion rate of €1.00=$1.3151) from operations by late 2010 depends on our ability to generate substantial earnings from our SPOT satellite messenger and other Simplex products and to maintain our current level of revenue from subscribers for two-way communications service. We introduced SPOT satellite messenger products and services to consumers in November 2007; accordingly the longer term commercial success of this product is still uncertain. After 2010, our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to complete construction of our second-generation satellite constellation is based on the continued success of these Simplex product offerings and our ability both to transition our then-existing two-way subscriber base to significantly increased ARPU through rejuvenated two-way service with our new satellites, and to add new two-way subscribers at higher priced service offerings consistent with the enhanced capabilities and increased service quality we expect from our second-generation satellite constellation. 26 Table of Contents We will need to obtain substantial funding from third-party sources to complete the procurement and deployment of our second-generation satellite constellation. This funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, if our future revenues or cash flow are below our expectations, whether as a result of the impact on our two-way subscriber base from degradation of our existing constellation, our failure to generate sufficient revenue from our SPOT satellite messenger and other Simplex products or for any other reason. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and from additional capital sources and are therefore unable to fund the procurement and deployment of our second-generation satellite constellation in the time period described above, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity would be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, if for any other reason we are unable to deploy our second- generation satellite constellation before our current constellation ceases to provide commercially viable service, we are likely to lose subscribers, and will incur a further decline in revenues and profitability as our ability to provide commercially viable service declines. We currently are unable to offer service in important regions of the world due to the absence of gateways in those areas, which is limiting our growth and our ability to compete. Our objective is to establish a worldwide service network, either directly or through independent gateway operators, but to date we have been unable to do so in certain areas of the world and we may not succeed in doing so in the future. We have been unable to finance our own gateways or to find capable independent gateway operators for several important regions and countries, including Eastern and Southern Africa, India, and certain parts of Southeast Asia. In addition to the lack of global service availability, cost-effective roaming is not yet available in certain countries because the independent gateway operators have been unable to reach business arrangements with one another. This could reduce overall demand for our products and services and undermine our value for potential users who require service in these areas. Rapid and significant technological changes in the satellite communications industry may impair our competitive position and require us to make significant additional capital expenditures. The hardware and software we utilize in operating our gateways were designed and manufactured over 10 years ago and portions are becoming obsolete. We have contracted to replace the hardware and software beginning in 2011; however the original equipment may become less reliable as it ages and will be more difficult and expensive to service. Although we maintain inventories of spare parts, it nonetheless may be difficult or impossible to obtain all necessary replacement parts for the hardware before the new equipment and software is fully deployed. We expect to face competition in the future from companies using new technologies and new satellite systems. The space and communications industries are subject to rapid advances and innovations in technology. New technology could render our system obsolete or less competitive by satisfying consumer demand in more attractive ways or through the introduction of incompatible standards. Particular technological developments that could adversely affect us include the deployment by our competitors of new satellites with greater power, greater flexibility, greater efficiency or greater capabilities, as well as continuing improvements in terrestrial wireless technologies. We have had to commit, and must continue to commit, to make significant capital expenditures to keep up with technological changes and remain competitive. Customer acceptance of the services and products that we offer will continually be affected by technology-based differences in our product and service offerings. New technologies may be protected by patents and therefore may not be available to us. A natural disaster could diminish our ability to provide communications service. Natural disasters could damage or destroy our ground stations resulting in a disruption of service to our customers. In addition, the collateral effects of such disasters such as flooding may impair the 27 Table of Contents functioning of our ground equipment. If a natural disaster were to impair or destroy any of our ground facilities, we might be unable to provide service to our customers in the affected area for a period of time. Even if our gateways are not affected by natural disasters, our service could be disrupted if a natural disaster damages the public switch telephone network or terrestrial wireless networks or our ability to connect to the public switch telephone network or terrestrial wireless networks. Such failure or service disruptions could harm our business and results of operations. We may not be able to launch our satellites successfully. Loss of one or more satellites during launch could delay or impair our ability to offer our services or reduce our revenues and launch insurance will not fully cover this risk. We have in the past insured the launch of our satellites, but we do not insure our existing satellites during their remaining in-orbit operational lives. Insurance proceeds would likely be available in the event of a launch failure, but acquiring replacements for any of the satellites will cause a delay in the deployment of our second-generation constellation and any insurance proceeds would not cover lost revenue. We anticipate our launch failure insurance policy to include specified exclusions, deductibles and material change limitations. Some (but not all) exclusions could include damage arising from acts of war, anti-satellite devices and other similar potential risks for which exclusions were customary in the industry at the time the policy was written. If launch insurance rates were to rise substantially, our future launch costs would increase. In addition, in light of increasing costs, the scope of insurance exclusions and limitations on the nature of the losses for which we can obtain insurance, or other business reasons, we may conclude that it does not make business sense to obtain third-party insurance and may decide to pursue other strategies for mitigating the risk of a satellite launch failure, such as purchasing additional spare satellites or obtaining relaunch guaranties from the launch provider. It is also possible that insurance could become unavailable, either generally or for a specific launch vehicle, or that new insurance could be subject to broader exclusions on coverage, in which event we would bear the risk of launch failures. An FCC decision to license a second CDMA operator in our band, or to take other steps that would reduce our existing spectrum allocation or impose additional spectrum sharing agreements on us, could adversely affect our services and operations. Under the FCC's plan for mobile satellite services in our frequency bands, we must share frequencies in the United States with other licensed mobile satellite services operators. To date, there are no other authorized CDMA-based mobile satellite services operators and no pending applications for authorization. However the FCC or other regulatory authorities may require us to share spectrum with other systems that are not currently licensed by the United States or any other jurisdiction. Spectrum values historically have been volatile, which could cause the value of our company to fluctuate. Our business plan may include forming strategic partnerships to maximize value for our spectrum, network assets and combined service offerings in the United States and internationally. Value that we may be able to realize from such partnerships will depend in part on the value ascribed to our spectrum. Valuations of spectrum in other frequency bands historically have been volatile, and we cannot predict at what amount a future partner may be willing to value our spectrum and other assets. In addition, to the extent that the FCC takes action that makes additional spectrum available or promotes the more flexible use or greater availability (e.g., via spectrum leasing or new spectrum sales) of existing satellite or terrestrial spectrum allocations, the availability of such additional spectrum could reduce the value of our spectrum authorizations and business. 28 Table of Contents We face intense competition in all of our markets, which could result in a loss of customers and lower revenues and make it more difficult for us to enter new markets. Satellite-based Competitors There are currently four other satellite operators providing services similar to ours on a global or regional basis: Iridium, Inmarsat and its subsidiary ACeS, SkyTerra, and Thuraya. In addition, ICO Global Communications (Holdings) Limited launched a satellite in 2008 and TerreStar Corporation and SkyTerra plan to launch their new satellites in the next year. The provision of satellite-based products and services is subject to downward price pressure when the capacity exceeds demand. Although we believe there is currently no commercially available product comparable in size, price and functionality to our SPOT satellite messenger, other providers of satellite-based products could introduce their own similar products if the SPOT satellite messenger is successful, which may materially adversely affect our business plan. In addition, we may face competition from new competitors or new technologies. With so many companies targeting many of the same customers, we may not be able to retain successfully our existing customers and attract new customers and as a result may not grow our customer base and revenue. Terrestrial Competitors In addition to our satellite-based competitors, terrestrial wireless voice and data service providers are continuing to expand into rural and remote areas, particularly in less developed countries, and providing the same general types of services and products that we provide through our satellite-based system. Many of these companies have greater resources, greater name recognition and newer technologies than we do. Industry consolidation could adversely affect us by increasing the scale or scope of our competitors and thereby making it more difficult for us to compete. We could lose market share and revenue as a result of increasing competition from the extension of land-based communication services. Although satellite communications services and ground-based communications services are not perfect substitutes, the two compete in certain markets and for certain services. Consumers generally perceive wireless voice communication products and services as cheaper and more convenient than satellite-based ones. ATC Competitors We also expect to compete with a number of other satellite companies that plan to develop ATC integrated networks. For example, SkyTerra and ICO Global have received licenses from the FCC to operate an ATC network. Other competitors are expected to seek approval from the FCC to operate ATC services. Any of these competitors could offer an integrated satellite and terrestrial network before we do, could combine with terrestrial networks that provide them with greater financial or operational flexibility than we have, or could offer an ATC network that customers prefer over ours. The loss of customers, particularly our large customers, may reduce our future revenues. We may lose customers due to competition, consolidation, regulatory developments, business developments affecting our customers or their customers, the constellation degradation or for other reasons. Our top 10 customers for 2008 and 2007 accounted for, in the aggregate, approximately 11% and 16% of our total revenues of $86.1 million and $98.4 million, respectively. For 2008 and 2007, revenues from our largest customer were $1.8 million or 2%, and $6.2 million or 6% of our total revenues, respectively. If we fail to maintain our relationships with our major customers, if we lose them and fail to replace them with other similar customers, or if we experience reduced demand from our major customers, our profitability could be significantly reduced through the loss of these revenues. 29 Table of Contents In addition, we may be required to record additional costs to the extent that amounts due from these customers become uncollectible. More generally, our customers may fail to renew or may cancel their service contracts with us, which could negatively affect future revenues and profitability. Our customers include multiple agencies of the U.S. government. Service sales to U.S. government agencies constituted approximately 12% and 11% of our total service revenue for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Government sales are made pursuant to individual purchase orders placed from time to time by the governmental agencies and are not related to long-term contracts. U.S. government agencies may terminate their business with us at any time without penalty and are subject to changes in government budgets and appropriations. Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which mandates how we may operate our business and may increase our cost of providing services, slow our expansion into new markets and subject our services to additional competitive pressures. Our ownership and operation of wireless communication systems are subject to significant regulation in the United States by the FCC and in foreign jurisdictions by similar local authorities. The rules and regulations of the FCC or these foreign authorities may change and may not continue to permit our operations as presently conducted or as we plan to conduct them. For example, the FCC has cancelled and refused to date to reinstate our license for spectrum in the 2 GHz band and has since licensed this spectrum to other entities for their mobile satellite service systems. Failure to provide services in accordance with the terms of our licenses or failure to operate our satellites, ground stations, or other terrestrial facilities (including those necessary to provide ATC services) as required by our licenses and applicable government regulations could result in the imposition of government sanctions against us, up to and including cancellation of our licenses. Our system requires regulatory authorization in each of the markets in which we or the independent gateway operators provide service. We and the independent gateway operators may not be able to obtain or retain all regulatory approvals needed for operations. For example, the company with which Old Globalstar contracted to establish an independent gateway operation in South Africa was unable to obtain an operating license from the Republic of South Africa and abandoned the business in 2001. Regulatory changes, such as those resulting from judicial decisions or adoption of treaties, legislation or regulation in countries where we operate or intend to operate, may also significantly affect our business. Because regulations in each country are different, we may not be aware if some of the independent gateway operators and/or persons with which we or they do business do not hold the requisite licenses and approvals. Our current regulatory approvals could now be, or could become, insufficient in the view of foreign regulatory authorities. Furthermore, any additional necessary approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all, in all jurisdictions in which we wish to offer services, and applicable restrictions in those jurisdictions could become unduly burdensome. Our operations are subject to certain regulations of the United States State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (i.e., the export of satellites and related technical data), United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (i.e., financial transactions) and the United States Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (i.e., our gateways and phones). These regulations may limit or delay our ability to operate in a particular country. As new laws and regulations are issued, we may be required to modify our business plans or operations. If we fail to comply with these regulations in any country, we could be subject to sanctions that could affect, materially and adversely, our ability to operate in that country. Failure to obtain the authorizations necessary to use our assigned radio frequency spectrum and to distribute our products in certain countries could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue and on our overall competitive position. 30 Table of Contents If we do not develop, acquire and maintain proprietary information and intellectual property rights, it could limit the growth of our business and reduce our market share. Our business depends on technical knowledge, and we believe that our future success is based, in part, on our ability to keep up with new technological developments and incorporate them in our products and services. We own or have the right to use our patents, work products, inventions, designs, software, systems and similar know-how. Although we have taken diligent steps to protect that information, the information may be disclosed to others or others may independently develop similar information, systems and know-how. Protection of our information, systems and know-how may result in litigation, the cost of which could be substantial. Third parties may assert claims that our products or services infringe on their proprietary rights. Any such claims, if made, may prevent or limit our sales of products or services or increase our costs of sales. Thus far, one company has filed a lawsuit against us for allegedly infringing with its patent rights. See "Item 3Legal Proceedings." Additional claims could be made in the future. We license much of the software we require to support critical gateway operations from third parties, including QUALCOMM and Space Systems/Loral Inc. This software was developed or customized specifically for our use. We also license software to support customer service functions, such as billing, from third parties which developed or customized it specifically for our use. If the third party licensors were to cease to support and service the software, or the licenses were to no longer be available on commercially reasonable terms, it may be difficult, expensive or impossible to obtain such services from alternative vendors. Replacing such software could be difficult, time consuming and expensive, and might require us to obtain substitute technology with lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost. We face special risks by doing business in developing markets, including currency and expropriation risks, which could increase our costs or reduce our revenues in these areas. Although our most economically important geographic markets currently are the United States and Canada, we have substantial markets for our mobile satellite services in, and our business plan includes, developing countries or regions that are underserved by existing telecommunications systems, such as rural Venezuela, Brazil and Central America. Developing countries are more likely than industrialized countries to experience market, currency and interest rate fluctuations and may have higher inflation. In addition, these countries present risks relating to government policy, price, wage and exchange controls, social instability, expropriation and other adverse economic, political and diplomatic conditions. Although we receive a majority of our revenues in U.S. dollars, and our independent gateway operators are required to pay us in U.S. dollars, limited availability of U.S. currency in some local markets or governmental controls on the export of currency may prevent an independent gateway operator from making payments in U.S. dollars or delay the availability of payment due to foreign bank currency processing and approval. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations may affect our ability to control the prices charged for the independent gateway operators' services. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial results. Our operations involve transactions in a variety of currencies. Sales denominated in foreign currencies primarily involve the Canadian dollar and the Euro. A substantial majority of our obligations, including the funds held in escrow to secure our payment obligations under the contract for construction of our second-generation satellite constellation, are denominated in Euros. Accordingly, our operating results may be significantly affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates for these currencies, and increases in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar have effectively substantially increased the Euro-denominated costs of procuring our second-generation satellite 31 Table of Contents constellation and related ground facilities. Further declines in the dollar will exacerbate this problem. A 1% decline in the dollar vis-à-vis the Euro would increase our committed purchase obligations by approximately $5.9 million. Approximately 36% and 37% of our total sales were to retail customers in Canada, Europe, Venezuela and Brazil (which we added in the first quarter of 2008) during 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our results of operations for 2008 and 2007 reflected losses of $4.5 million and $8.2 million, respectively, on foreign currency transactions. Our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates has increased significantly as a result of our satellite contracts. We may be unable to offset unfavorable currency movements as they adversely affect our revenue and expenses or to hedge them effectively. Our inability to do so could have a substantial negative impact on our operating results and cash flows. If we become subject to unanticipated foreign tax liabilities, it could materially increase our costs. We operate in various foreign tax jurisdictions. We believe that we have complied in all material respects with our obligations to pay taxes in these jurisdictions. However, our position is subject to review and possible challenge by the taxing authorities of these jurisdictions. If the applicable taxing authorities were to challenge successfully our current tax positions, or if there were changes in the manner in which we conduct our activities, we could become subject to material unanticipated tax liabilities. We may also become subject to additional tax liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws, which could in certain circumstances have a retroactive effect. As a result of our acquisition of an independent gateway operator in Brazil during 2008, we are exposed to potential pre-acquisition tax liabilities estimated at approximately $10.5 million, for which we are fully indemnified by the seller. We may also be exposed to potential pre-acquisition liabilities for which we may not be fully indemnified by the seller or the seller may fail to perform its indemnification obligations. We rely on a limited number of key vendors for timely supply of equipment and services. If our key vendors fail to provide equipment and services to us, we may face difficulties in finding alternative sources and may not be able to operate our business successfully. We depend on QUALCOMM as the exclusive manufacturer of phones using the IS 41 CDMA North American standard, which incorporates QUALCOMM proprietary technology. We expect QUALCOMM to terminate its business relationship with us when its current contractual obligations are completed in approximately two years. In addition, we currently have a maintenance and support contract with QUALCOMM that ends in 2010. If QUALCOMM terminates any one of these relationships, we may not be able to find a replacement supplier or perform the maintenance and support ourselves. Although we have contracted with Hughes and Ericsson to provide new hardware and software for our ground component, there could be a substantial period of time in which their products or services are not available and QUALCOMM no longer supports its products and services. We depend on Axonn L.L.C. to produce and sell the data modems through which we provide our Simplex service, including our SPOT satellite messenger products, which incorporate Axonn proprietary technology. Axonn is currently our sole source for obtaining these data modems. If Axonn were to cease producing and selling these data modems, in order to continue to expand our Simplex service, we would either have to acquire from Axonn the right to have the modems manufactured by another vendor or develop a modem that did not rely on Axonn's proprietary technology. We have no long-term commitments from Axonn for the production and sale of these data modems. 32 Table of Contents Pursuing strategic transactions may cause us to incur additional risks. We may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic transactions on an opportunistic basis, although no new transactions that would be financially significant to us are probable at this time. We may face costs and risks arising from any such transactions, including integrating a new business into our business or managing a joint venture. These may include legal, organizational, financial and other costs and risks. In addition, if we were to choose to engage in any major business combination or similar strategic transaction, we may require significant external financing in connection with the transaction. Depending on market conditions, investor perceptions of us and other factors, we may not be able to obtain capital on acceptable terms, in acceptable amounts or at appropriate times to implement any such transaction. Any such financing, if obtained, may further dilute our existing stockholders. Our indebtedness could impair our ability to react to changes in our business and may limit our ability to use debt to fund future capital needs. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition. If the $200.0 million in committed facilities under our restated and amended credit agreement had been drawn fully at December 31, 2008, our indebtedness would have been $329.0 million. This would have resulted in annual interest expense of approximately $36.2 million, assuming an interest rate of 11.0%. In addition, we anticipate incurring additional indebtedness in connection with our future business plans. Our indebtedness could: require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to principal payments on our debt in years when the debt matures, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate expenditures; result in an event of default if we fail to comply with the restrictive covenants contained in our credit agreement, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable; increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions because our debt could mature at a time when those conditions make it difficult to refinance and our cash flow is insufficient to repay the debt in full, forcing us to sell assets at disadvantageous prices or to default on the debt; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, competition and/or changes in our business or our industry by limiting our ability to incur additional debt, to make acquisitions and divestitures or to engage in transactions that could be beneficial to us; restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, introducing new products or services or exploiting business opportunities; and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt or greater financial resources. Furthermore, if an event of default were to occur with respect to our credit agreement or other indebtedness, our creditors could accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness. Our indebtedness under our credit agreement is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries and the lenders could foreclose on these assets to repay the indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance indebtedness obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. 33 Table of Contents These alternative measures may not be successful or feasible. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to sell assets. Even if we could consummate those sales, the proceeds that we realize from them may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. We plan to incur additional indebtedness or other obligations in the future, which would exacerbate the risks discussed above. Our credit agreement permits us to incur, in addition to the $200.0 million of revolving credit and delayed draw term loans that Thermo Funding Company LLC, or Thermo Funding, has committed to advance under the credit agreement, other indebtedness under certain conditions, including up to $250.0 million of additional equally and ratably secured, pari passu, term loans, up to $200.0 million of unsecured debt and up to $25.0 million of purchase money indebtedness or capitalized leases. We may incur this additional indebtedness only if no event of default under our credit agreement then exists and if we are in pro forma compliance with all of the financial covenants of our credit agreement. Our credit agreement also permits us to incur obligations that do not constitute "indebtedness" as defined in the credit agreement, including obligations to satellite vendors that are not evidenced by a note and not secured by assets other than those purchased with such obligations. To the extent additional debt or other obligations are added to our currently anticipated debt levels, the substantial indebtedness risks described above would increase. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such indebtedness, which may not be successful. Restrictive covenants in our credit agreement impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility. Our credit agreement contains a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to: incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders; make investments, acquisitions or capital expenditures; repurchase or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; grant liens on our assets; incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us; enter into transactions with our affiliates; incur obligations to vendors of satellites; merge or consolidate with other entities or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and transfer or sell assets. Complying with these restrictive covenants, as well as those that may be contained in any agreements governing future indebtedness, may impair our ability to finance our operations or capital needs or to take advantage of other favorable business opportunities. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants will depend on our future performance, which may be affected by events beyond our control. If we violate any of these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, we would be in default under the agreement and payment of the indebtedness could be accelerated. The acceleration of our indebtedness under one agreement may permit acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on 34 Table of Contents terms that are acceptable to us. If our indebtedness is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the common stock and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business plan and compete against companies who are not subject to such restrictions. Furthermore, our ability to draw on our credit facility is subject to conditions, including the absence of a material adverse change after September 30, 2007 in our business or financial condition, other than a change resulting from existing and future first-generation satellite constellation degradation or failure issues. We are a defendant in a shareholder class action lawsuit arising out of our initial public offering in 2006 and we may be involved in additional litigation in the future. On February 9, 2007, the first of three purported class action lawsuits was filed against us, our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and our Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that our registration statement related to our initial public offering ("IPO") in November 2006 contained material misstatements and omissions. The Court consolidated the three cases as Ladmen Partners, Inc. v. Globalstar, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:07-CV-0976 (LAP), and appointed Connecticut Laborers' Pension Fund as lead plaintiff. On September 30, 2008, the court granted our motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint with prejudice. The plaintiffs (now appellants) appealed and filed their brief on January 29, 2009. Our brief was filed on March 30, 2009. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in this lawsuit. Failure to prevail in any or all actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the future. In addition, we are currently, and in the past have been, and in the future may become, subject to other litigation. Litigation is often expensive and diverts management's attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Recessionary indicators and continued volatility in global economic conditions and the financial markets have adversely affected and may continue to affect adversely sales of our SPOT satellite messenger product and reduce our ability to raise additional capital in order to complete our second-generation constellation. The volatility and disruption to the financial markets has reached unprecedented levels and has significantly adversely impacted global economic conditions. As a result, consumer confidence and demand have declined substantially. These conditions could lead to further reduced consumer spending in the foreseeable future, especially for discretionary travel and related products. A substantial portion of the potential addressable market for our SPOT satellite messenger products and services relates to recreational users, such as mountain climbers, campers, kayakers, sport fishermen and wilderness hikers. These potential customers may reduce their activities due to economic conditions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. These conditions also have materially impacted liquidity in the capital and credit markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive or unavailable. Continued uncertainty may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing or make it difficult or more costly to raise capital through the issuance of our equity or debt securities. These disruptions have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock. Failure to satisfy NASDAQ Global Select Market listing requirements may result in our common stock being removed from listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Our Common Stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "GSAT." For continued inclusion on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, we must generally maintain, 35 Table of Contents among other requirements, either (a) shareholders' equity of at least $10 million, a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share and a market value of our public float of at least $5 million; or (b) market capitalization of at least $50 million, a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share and a market value of our public float of at least $15 million. On March 6, 2009, the closing bid price of our common stock was $0.37 and our public float was $48.0 million. NASDAQ has suspended enforcement, through July 20, 2009, of the rules requiring a minimum closing bid price and a minimum market value of public float. After July 20, 2009, however, if we fail to meet the minimum closing bid price or the minimum market value standards described above for at least 30 consecutive trading days, our Common Stock could be at risk of being removed from listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. If our Common Stock were removed from listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, our Common Stock may be transferred to the NASDAQ Capital Market if we satisfy the listing criteria for the NASDAQ Capital Market, or trading of our Common Stock may be conducted in the over-the-counter market in the so-called "pink sheets" or, if available, the National Association of Securities Dealer's "Electronic Bulletin Board." Consequently, broker-dealers may be less willing or able to sell and/or make a market in our Common Stock, which may make it more difficult for shareholders to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our Common Stock. Removal of our Common Stock from listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market may also make it more difficult for us to raise capital through the sale of our securities. In addition, if our Common Stock is not listed on a U.S. national stock exchange, such as NASDAQ, or approved for quotation and trading on a national automated dealer quotation system or established automated over-the-counter trading market, holders of our 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes will have the option to require us to repurchase the Notes, which we may not have sufficient financial resources to do. We do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Any future dividend payments are within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, business opportunities, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. We may not generate sufficient cash from operations in the future to pay dividends on our common stock. Our credit agreement currently prohibits the payment of cash dividends. The market price of our common stock is volatile and there is a limited market for our shares. The trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include: actual or anticipated variations in our operating results; further failure in the performance of our current or future satellites or a delay in the launch of our second-generation satellites; failure to obtain adequate financing in a timely manner; changes in financial estimates by research analysts, or any failure by us to meet or exceed any such estimates, or changes in the recommendations of any research analysts that elect to follow our common stock or the common stock of our competitors; actual or anticipated changes in economic, political or market conditions, such as recessions or international currency fluctuations; actual or anticipated changes in the regulatory environment affecting our industry; actual or anticipated sales of common stock by our controlling stockholder; changes in the market valuations of our industry peers; and 36 Table of Contents announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. You may be unable to resell your shares of our common stock at or above the initial purchase price. Additionally, because we are a controlled company there is a limited market for our common stock and we cannot assure you that a trading market will develop further or be maintained. Trading volume for our common stock historically has been low. Sales of significant amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price of our stock. The future issuance of additional shares of our common stock could cause dilution of ownership interests and adversely affect our stock price. We may in the future issue our previously authorized and unissued securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our current stockholders. We are currently authorized to issue 800 million shares of common stock, of which approximately 136.6 million were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2008 and 663.4 million were available for future issuance, of which approximately 27.1 million shares are reserved for specific future issuances. The potential issuance of such additional shares of common stock, whether directly or pursuant to any conversion right of any convertible securities, may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock for capital raising or other business purposes. Future sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. We may issue shares of preferred stock or debt securities with greater rights than our common stock. Subject to the rules of The NASDAQ Global Select Market, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from holders of our common stock. Currently, there are 100 million shares of preferred stock authorized but none issued. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends, priority and liquidation premiums and may have greater voting rights than holders of our common stock. If persons engage in short sales of our common stock, the price of our common stock may decline. Selling short is a technique used by a stockholder to take advantage of an anticipated decline in the price of a security. A significant number of short sales or a large volume of other sales within a relatively short period of time can create downward pressure on the market price of a security. Further sales of common stock could cause even greater declines in the price of our common stock due to the number of additional shares available in the market, which could encourage short sales that could further undermine the value of our common stock. Holders of our securities could, therefore, experience a decline in the value of their investment as a result of short sales of our common stock. Provisions in our charter documents and credit agreement and provisions of Delaware law may discourage takeovers, which could affect the rights of holders of our common stock. Provisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and our credit agreement could hamper a third party's acquisition of us or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions include: the absence of cumulative voting in the election of our directors, which means that the holders of a majority of our common stock may elect all of the directors standing for election; 37 Table of Contents the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting rights or with rights senior to those of the common stock without any further vote or action by the holders of our common stock; the division of our board of directors into three separate classes serving staggered three-year terms; the ability of our stockholders, at such time when Thermo does not own a majority of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, to remove our directors only for cause and only by the vote of at least 662/3% of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors; prohibitions, at such time when Thermo does not own a majority of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, on our stockholders acting by written consent; prohibitions on our stockholders calling special meetings of stockholders or filling vacancies on our board of directors; the requirement, at such time when Thermo does not own a majority of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, that our stockholders must obtain a super-majority vote to amend or repeal our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws; change of control provisions in our credit agreement, which provide that a change of control will constitute an event of default and, unless waived by the lenders, will result in the acceleration of the maturity of all indebtedness under the credit agreement; change of control provisions relating to our 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes, which provide that a change of control will permit holders of the Notes to demand immediate repayment; and change of control provisions in our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, which provide that a change of control may accelerate the vesting of all outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock. We also are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder. This provision does not apply to Thermo, which became our principal stockholder prior to our initial public offering. These provisions also could make it more difficult for you and our other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions, and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. We are controlled by Thermo, whose interests may conflict with yours. As of December 31, 2008, Thermo owned approximately 48% of our outstanding common stock. Thermo is able to control the election of all of the members of our board of directors and the vote on substantially all other matters, including significant corporate transactions such as the approval of a merger or other transaction involving our sale. We have depended substantially on Thermo to provide capital to finance our business. In 2006 and 2007, Thermo Funding purchased an aggregate of $200 million of our Common Stock at prices substantially above market. On December 17, 2007, Thermo Funding assumed all of the obligations and was assigned all of the rights (other than indemnification rights) of the administrative agent and the lenders under our amended and restated credit agreement. As of December 31, 2008, we were indebted to Thermo Funding under this credit agreement in the amount of $166.1 million, and we borrowed an additional $7.8 million under this credit agreement in 2009. These loans are secured by a first lien on 38 Table of Contents our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries, other than our FCC licenses. Thermo is not obligated to provide any additional capital to us. Thermo is controlled by James Monroe III, our chairman and chief executive officer. Through Thermo, Mr. Monroe holds equity interests in, and serves as an executive officer or director of, a diverse group of privately-owned businesses not otherwise related to us. Although Mr. Monroe receives no compensation from us, he has advised us that he intends to devote whatever portion of his time is necessary to perform his duties as our chairman and chief executive officer. We do reimburse Thermo and Mr. Monroe for certain expenses they incur in connection with our business. The interests of Thermo may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Thermo may take actions it believes will benefit its equity investment in us or loans to us even though such actions might not be in your best interests as a holder of our common stock. As a "controlled company," as defined in the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, we qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Thermo owns Common Stock representing more than a majority of the voting power in election of our directors. As a result, we are considered a "controlled company" within the meaning of the corporate governance standards in the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. Under these rules, a "controlled company" may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors, the requirement that it have a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities and the requirement that it have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities. We have elected to be treated as a controlled company and thus utilize these exemptions. As a result, we do not have a majority of independent directors nor do we have compensation and nominating/corporate governance committees consisting entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, you do not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ Marketplace corporate governance requirements. Our pre-emptive rights offering, which we may commence in the future, is not in strict compliance with the technical requirements of our prior certificate of incorporation. Our certificate of incorporation as in effect when we entered into the irrevocable standby stock purchase agreement with Thermo Funding provided that stockholders who are accredited investors (as defined under the Securities Act) were entitled to pre-emptive rights with respect to the transaction with Thermo Funding. We may offer our stockholders as of June 15, 2006 who are accredited investors the opportunity to participate in the transaction contemplated by the irrevocable standby stock purchase agreement with Thermo Funding on a pro rata basis on substantially the same terms as Thermo Funding. Some of our stockholders could allege that the offering does not comply fully with the terms of our prior certificate of incorporation. Although we believe any variance from the requirements of our former certificate of incorporation is immaterial and that we had valid reasons for delaying the pre-emptive rights offering until after our initial public offering, a court may not agree with our position if these stockholders allege that we have violated their pre-emptive rights. In that case, we can not predict the type of remedy the court could award such stockholders. The pre-emptive rights offering, which we are required to make to our existing stockholders, will be done on a registered basis, and may negatively affect the trading price of our stock. The pre-emptive rights offering will be made pursuant to a registration statement filed with, and potentially reviewed by, the SEC. After giving effect to waivers that we have already received, up to 785,328 shares of our Common Stock may be purchased if the pre-emptive rights offering is fully subscribed. Such shares may be purchased at approximately $16.17 per share, regardless of the trading 39 Table of Contents price of our Common Stock. The nature of the pre-emptive rights offering may negatively affect the trading price of our Common Stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not Applicable
