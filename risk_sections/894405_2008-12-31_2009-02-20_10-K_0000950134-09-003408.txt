ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Â— continued As previously mentioned, the highly competitive industry in which we operate could impact the viability of contributing employers. The effect of any one or combination of these business risks, which are outside our control, has the potential to affect the funding status of the multiemployer pension plans, potential withdrawal liabilities and our future contribution requirements. Our information technology systems are subject to certain risks that are beyond our control. We depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems in operating our business. These systems include our communications and data processing systems. Our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards. However, they are still vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins and similar events. To mitigate the potential for such occurrences to disrupt business operations at our corporate headquarters, we have implemented various systems including redundant telecommunication facilities; a fire suppression system to protect our on-site data center; and a generator that is able to adequately supply power to the headquarters building in the event of power outages. We have a catastrophic disaster recovery plan and alternate processing capability, which is designed so that critical data processes should be fully operational within 48 hours. This plan provides for work space, phones, and desktop computers for employees who are critical to basic operations within 48 hours of a catastrophe which renders our corporate headquarters unusable. An emergency communications Web site has also been constructed to provide information to our employees and customers during such a disaster. We have business interruption insurance, including, in certain circumstances, insurance against terrorist attacks under the federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which would offset losses up to certain coverage limits in the event of a catastrophe. However, a significant system failure, security breach, disruption by a virus or other damage could still interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation and cause a loss of customers. Our results of operations can be impacted by seasonal fluctuations or adverse weather conditions. We can be impacted by seasonal fluctuations which affect tonnage and shipment levels. Freight shipments, operating costs and earnings can also be affected adversely by inclement weather conditions. We are also subject to risks and uncertainties that affect many other businesses, including: Any liability resulting from and the cost of defending against class-action litigation, such as alleged violations of anti-trust laws, wage-and-hour and discrimination claims, and any other legal proceedings; Widespread outbreak of an illness or communicable disease or public health crisis; and Operational or market disruptions arising from natural calamities, such as hurricanes, and from illegal acts including terrorist attacks. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome resulting from these risks and uncertainties. ITEM 1B.
