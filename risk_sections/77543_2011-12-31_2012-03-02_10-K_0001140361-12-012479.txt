ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We are subject to a number of risks, including those summarized below. Such risks could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See our disclosure under “Forward-looking Statements” on page 3. We may not fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog. As of December 31, 2011, our backlog of uncompleted construction work was approximately $6.1 billion. We include a construction project in our backlog at such time as a contract is awarded or a letter of commitment is obtained and adequate construction funding is in place. The revenue projected in our backlog may not be realized or, if realized, may not result in profits. For example, if a project reflected in our backlog is terminated, suspended or reduced in scope, it would result in a reduction to our backlog which could reduce, potentially to a material extent, the revenues and profits realized. If a customer cancels a project, we may be reimbursed for certain costs and profit thereon but typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog. Significant cancellations or delays of projects in our backlog could have a material effect on future revenues, profits, and cash flows. Current economic conditions could adversely affect our operations. The deterioration of economic and financial market conditions in the United States and overseas throughout 2009-2011, including severe disruptions in the credit markets, could continue to adversely affect our results of operations in future periods. The continued instability in the financial markets has made it difficult for certain of our customers, including private owners and state and local governments, to access the credit markets to obtain financing or refinancing, as the case may be, to fund new construction projects on satisfactory terms or at all. State and local governments continue to face potentially significant budget shortfalls as a result of declining tax and other revenues, which may cause them to defer or cancel planned infrastructure projects. During 2011, we have encountered increased levels of deferrals and delays related to new construction projects. Difficulty in obtaining adequate financing due to the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets may significantly increase the rate at which our customers defer, delay or cancel proposed new construction projects. Such deferrals, delays or cancellations could have an adverse impact on our future operating results. Instability in the financial markets may also impact a customers’ ability to pay us on a timely basis, or at all, for work on projects already under construction in accordance with the contract terms. Customer financing may be subject to periodic renewals and extensions of credit by the lender. As credit markets remain tight and difficult economic conditions persist, lenders may be unwilling to continue renewing or extending credit to a customer. Such deferral, delay or cancellation of credit by the lender could impact the customer’s ability to pay us, which could have an adverse impact on our future operating results. A significant portion of our operations are concentrated in California and New York. As a result, we are more susceptible to fluctuations caused by adverse economic or other conditions in these regions as opposed to others. Reductions in the level of consumer spending within the non-residential building industry, the level of federal, state and local government spending for infrastructure and other public projects, and the level of U.S. government’s funding with respect to construction projects in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guam could adversely affect the number of projects available to us in the future. With regard to the non-residential building industry, consumer spending is discretionary and may decline during economic downturns when consumers have less disposable income. Even an uncertain economic outlook may adversely affect consumer and private industry spending in various business operations, as consumers may spend less in anticipation of a potential economic downturn. Decreased spending in the non-residential building markets could deter new projects within the industry and the expansion or renovation of existing facilities. With regard to infrastructure and other public works spending, civil construction markets are dependent on the amount of infrastructure work funded by various governmental agencies which, in turn, depends on the condition of the existing infrastructure, the need for new or expanded infrastructure and federal, state or local government spending levels. A slowdown in economic activity in any of the markets that we serve may result in less spending on public works projects. In addition, a decrease or delay in government funding of infrastructure projects or delays in the implementation of voter-approved bond measures could decrease the number of civil construction projects available and limit our ability to obtain new contracts, which could reduce revenues within our Civil segment. In addition, budget shortfalls and credit rating downgrades in California and other states in which the Company is involved in significant infrastructure projects and any long-term impairment in the ability of state and local governments to finance construction projects by raising capital in the municipal bond market could curtail or delay the funding of future projects. Our Building segment also is involved in significant construction projects for public works projects including healthcare facilities, educational facilities, and municipal and government facilities primarily in California and the southeastern United States. These projects also are dependent upon funding by various federal, state and local governmental agencies. A decrease in government funding of public healthcare and education facilities, particularly in those regions, could decrease the number and/or size of construction projects available and limit our ability to obtain new contracts in these markets, which could further reduce our revenues and earnings. 16 Index With regard to the U.S. Government’s funding of construction projects in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guam, the United States federal government has approved various spending bills for the reconstruction and defense of Iraq and Afghanistan and has allocated significant funds to the defense of United States interests around the world from the threat of terrorism. The United States federal government has also approved funds for development in conjunction with the relocation of military personnel into Guam. A decrease in government funding of these projects or a decision by the United States federal government to reduce or eliminate the use of outside contractors to perform this work would decrease the number of projects available to us and limit our ability to obtain new contracts in this area. Economic, political and other risks associated with our international operations involve risks not faced by our domestic competitors, which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. We derived approximately 5.6% (or $208.0 million) of our revenues and approximately $28.4 million of income from construction operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 from our work on projects located outside of the United States, including projects in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guam. We expect non-U.S. projects to continue to be a significant contribution to our revenues and earnings for the foreseeable future. Our international operations expose us to risks inherent in doing business in certain hostile regions outside the United States, including: political risks, risks of loss due to civil disturbances, guerilla activities and insurrection; acts of terrorism and acts of war; unstable economic, financial and market conditions; potential incompatibility with foreign subcontractors and vendors; foreign currency controls and fluctuations; trade restrictions; variations in taxes; and changes in labor conditions, labor strikes and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. Failure to successfully manage risks associated with our international operations could result in higher operating costs than anticipated or could delay or limit our ability to generate revenues and income from construction operations in key international markets. We are subject to significant legal proceedings, which, if determined adversely to us, could harm our reputation, preclude us from bidding on future projects and/or have a material effect on us. We also may invest significant working capital on projects while legal proceedings are being settled. We are involved in various lawsuits, including the legal proceedings described under Item 3 -- “Legal Proceedings.” Litigation is inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict what the final outcome will be of any legal proceeding. A final judgment against us would require us to record the related liability and fund the payment of the judgment and, if such adverse judgment is significant, it could have a material adverse effect on us. Legal proceedings resulting in judgments or findings against us may harm our reputation and prospects for future contract awards. We occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional cost exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material effect on our liquidity and financial results. Our contracts require us to perform extra or change order work, which can result in disputes and adversely affect our working capital, profits and cash flows. Our contracts generally require us to perform extra, or change order, work as directed by the customer even if the customer has not agreed in advance on the scope or price of the work to be performed. This process can result in disputes over whether the work performed is beyond the scope of the work included in the original project plans and specifications or, if the customer agrees that the work performed qualifies as extra work, the price the customer is willing to pay for the extra work. Even when the customer agrees to pay for the extra work, we may be required to fund the cost of such work for a lengthy period of time until the change order is approved and funded by the customer. 17 Index Also, unapproved change orders, contract disputes or claims cause us to incur costs that cannot be billed currently and therefore may be reflected as "costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings" in our balance sheet. See Note 1(d) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. To the extent our actual recoveries with respect to unapproved change orders, contract disputes or claims are lower than our estimates, the amount of any shortfall will reduce our revenues and the amount of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings recorded on our balance sheet, and could have a material effect on our working capital, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, as we include unapproved change orders in our estimates of revenues and costs to complete a project, our profitability may be diluted via the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for contract revenues. Any delay caused by the extra work may also adversely impact the timely scheduling of other project work and our ability to meet specified contract milestone dates. Increased regulation of the hospitality and gaming industry could reduce the number of future hospitality and gaming projects available, which, in turn, could adversely affect our future earnings. The hospitality and gaming industry is regulated extensively by federal and state regulatory bodies, including state gaming commissions, the National Indian Gaming Commission and federal and state taxing and law enforcement agencies. From time to time, legislation is proposed in the legislatures of some of these jurisdictions that, if enacted, could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of the hospitality and gaming industry. Legislation of this type may be enacted in the future. The United States federal government has also previously considered a federal tax on casino revenues and may consider such a tax in the future. In addition, companies that operate in the hospitality and gaming industry are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. New legislation or hospitality and gaming regulations could deter future hospitality and gaming construction projects in jurisdictions in which we derive significant revenues. As a result, the enactment of any such new legislation or regulations could adversely affect our future earnings. If we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, revenues or costs on a contract, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on that contract. We generally enter into four principal types of contracts with our clients: fixed price contracts, cost plus fee contracts, guaranteed maximum price contracts, and construction management contracts. We derive a significant portion of our Civil, Specialty Contractors and Management Services segment revenues and backlog from fixed price contracts. ● Fixed price and certain design-build contracts require us to perform the contract for a fixed price irrespective of our actual costs. As a result, we realize a profit on these contracts only if we successfully control our costs and avoid cost overruns. ● Cost plus fee contracts provide for reimbursement of the costs required to complete a project, but generally have a lower base fee and an incentive fee based on cost and/or schedule performance. If our costs exceed the revenues available under such a contract or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract, we may not receive reimbursement for these costs. ● Guaranteed maximum price contracts provide for a cost plus fee arrangement up to a maximum agreed-upon price. These contracts also place the risk on us for cost overruns that exceed the guaranteed maximum price. ● Construction management contracts are those under which we agree to manage a project for a customer for an agreed upon fee, which may be fixed or may vary based upon negotiated factors. Profitability on these types of contracts is impacted by changes in the scope of work or design issues, which could cause cost overruns beyond our control and limit profits on these contracts. Cost overruns, whether due to inefficiency, faulty estimates or other factors, result in lower profit or a loss on a project. If our estimates of the overall risks, revenues or costs prove inaccurate or circumstances change, we may incur a lower profit or a loss on that contract. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting for contract revenues may result in material adjustments, which could result in a charge against our earnings. We recognize contract revenues using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, estimated contract revenues are recognized by applying the percentage of completion of the project for the period to the total estimated revenues for the contract. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Total contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum on a quarterly basis as the work progresses and as change orders are approved. Adjustments based upon the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues in the period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase or a reduction in or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, as applicable. Such credits or charges could be material and could cause our results to fluctuate materially from period to period. 18 Index We are subject to a number of risks as a U.S. government contractor, which could either harm our reputation, result in fines or penalties against us and/or adversely impact our financial condition. We are a provider of services to U.S. government agencies and therefore are exposed to risks associated with government contracting. We must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of government contracts which affect how we do business with our U.S. government customers and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulations allow our U.S. government customers to terminate our contracts for the failure to comply with regulatory requirements not directly related to performance and in certain cases, require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations. Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract terminations, suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. U.S. government agencies generally can terminate or modify their contracts with us at their convenience and some government contracts must be renewed annually at the U.S. government’s sole discretion. If a government agency terminates or fails to renew a contract, our backlog may be reduced. If a government agency terminates a contract due to our unsatisfactory performance, it could result in liability to us and harm our ability to compete for future contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, or DCAA, routinely audit our U.S. government contracts and contractors’ administration processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also review the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies, including our purchasing, property, estimating, and information systems. Only costs allowable under federal regulations may be properly charged to our government contracts and any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded or otherwise properly credited to the U.S. government in subsequent invoices. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes or systems is found not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government oversight and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome to an audit by the DCAA or another agency could cause our results to differ materially from those anticipated. If an investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. In addition, we would suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Our participation in construction joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners. As part of our business, we enter into joint venture arrangements typically to jointly bid on and execute particular projects, thereby reducing our financial or operational risk with respect to such projects. Success on these joint projects depends in large part on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations. We and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner’s shortfall. Further, if we are unable to adequately address our partner’s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm our reputation, and reduce our profit on a project (or in some cases a loss). 19 Index Our pension plan is underfunded and we may be required to make significant future contributions to the plan. Our defined benefit pension plan and our supplemental retirement plan are non-contributory pension plans covering many of our employees. Benefits under these plans were frozen as of June 1, 2004. As of December 31, 2011, these plans were underfunded by approximately $38.5 million. We are required to make cash contributions to our pension and supplemental retirement plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by employee benefit and tax laws. The amount of any such required contributions is determined based on an annual actuarial valuation of the plan as performed by the plans’ actuaries. During 2011, we contributed $6.2 million in cash to our defined benefit pension plan and supplemental retirement plan. The amount of our future contributions will depend upon asset returns, then-current discount rates and a number of other factors, and, as a result, the amount we may elect or be required to contribute to these plans in the future may vary significantly. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Critical Accounting Policies--Defined Benefit Retirement Plan." The construction services industry is highly schedule driven, and our failure to meet schedule requirements of our contracts could adversely affect our reputation and/or expose us to financial liability. Many of our contracts are subject to specific completion schedule requirements and subject us to liquidated damages in the event the construction schedules are not achieved. Our failure to meet schedule requirements could subject us not only to liquidated damages, but could further subject us to liability for our customer’s actual cost arising out of our delay and cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within our industry and customer base. Competition for new project awards is intense and our failure to compete effectively could reduce our market share and profits. New project awards are often determined through either a competitive bid basis or on a negotiated basis. Bid or negotiated contracts with public or private owners are generally awarded based upon price, but many times take into account other factors, such as shorter project schedules or prior experience with the customer. Within our industry, we compete with many national, regional and local construction firms. Some of these competitors have achieved greater market penetration than we have in the markets in which we compete, and some have greater financial and other resources than we do. As a result, we may need to accept lower contract margins or more fixed price or unit price contracts in order for us to compete against competitors that have the ability to accept awards at lower prices or have a pre-existing relationship with the customer. If we are unable to compete successfully in such markets, our relative market share and profits could be reduced. We will require substantial personnel, including engineers, project managers, and specialty subcontractor resources to execute and perform on our contracts in backlog. The successful execution of our business strategies is also dependent upon our ability to attract and retain key officers. Our ability to execute and perform on our contracts in backlog depends in large part upon our ability to hire and retain highly skilled personnel, including engineering, and project management. In addition, our construction projects require a significant amount of trade labor resources, such as carpenters, masons and other skilled workers, as well as certain specialty subcontractor skills. In the event we are unable to attract, hire and retain the requisite personnel and subcontractors necessary to execute and perform on our contract backlog, we may experience delays in completing projects in accordance with project schedules, which may have a material effect on our financial results and harm our reputation. Further, the increased demand for personnel and specialty subcontractors may result in higher costs which could cause us to exceed the budget on a project, which in turn may have a material effect on our results of operations and harm our relationships with our customers. In addition, if we lack the personnel and specialty subcontractors necessary to perform on our current contract backlog, we may find it necessary to curtail our pursuit of new projects. Although the risk has been mitigated with the specialty contracting capabilities that we acquired during 2011, we will still rely on significant external specialty subcontractors to perform our projects. The execution of our business strategies also substantially depends on our ability to retain the continued service of several key members of our management. Losing the services of these executives could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement can be found. The majority of these executives are not bound by employment agreements with us nor do we maintain key person life insurance policies for these executives. 20 Index An inability to obtain bonding could limit the number of projects we are able to pursue. As is customary in the construction business, we often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance under construction contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety market. Surety companies consider such factors in relation to the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. The surety industry has undergone significant changes with several companies withdrawing completely from the industry or significantly reducing their bonding commitment. In addition, certain reinsurers of surety risk have limited their participation in this market. Therefore, we could be unable to obtain surety bonds, when required, which could adversely affect our future results of operations and revenues. The process of managing and integrating the recent acquisitions into our Company may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial, operational and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the operation, development and expansion of our existing business. During 2011 we completed an acquisition strategy, in which we acquired Superior Gunite, Fisk, Anderson, Frontier-Kemper, Lunda, WDF, FSE, Nagelbush and Becho. To the extent that we experience unforeseen difficulties in the integration of these recent acquisitions, we may also have difficulty achieving our operating, strategic and financial objectives. Acquisitions also may involve a number of special financial, business and operational risks, such as: ● difficulties in integrating diverse corporate cultures and management styles; ● additional or conflicting government regulation; ● disparate company policies and practices; ● client relationship issues; ● customer relationship issues as a result of our general contractor competitors employing our newly acquired specialty contractors; ● diversion of our management’s time, attention and resources; ● decreased utilization during the integration process; ● loss of key existing or acquired personnel; ● increased costs to improve or coordinate managerial, operational, financial and administrative systems; ● dilutive issuances of equity securities, including convertible debt securities to finance acquisitions; ● the assumption of legal liabilities; and ● amortization of acquired intangible assets. In connection with mergers and acquisitions, we have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become impaired and adversely affect our operating results. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our mergers and acquisitions have been accounted for under the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method, the total purchase price we pay is allocated to the acquired company’s tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the date of completion of the merger or acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over those estimated fair values is recorded as goodwill. We test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter of each year, and between these periods if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that the goodwill or intangible assets should be evaluated. At December 31, 2011, the carrying value of the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in mergers and acquisitions totaled $959.4 million and represents 26.6% of our total assets of $3.6 billion. To the extent the value of the goodwill or other intangible assets becomes impaired in the future, we will be required to incur non-cash charges to the Consolidated Statements of Operations relating to such impairment. In 2008, the Company incurred a $224.5 million non-cash impairment charge pertaining to our annual impairment test. Conflicts of interest may arise involving certain of our directors. We have engaged in joint ventures, primarily in civil construction, with O&G Industries, Inc., a Connecticut corporation, whose Vice Chairman is Raymond R. Oneglia, one of our directors. As of December 31, 2011, the Company has a 30% interest in a joint venture with O&G as the sponsor for a highway reconstruction project with an estimated total contract value of approximately $357 million and an estimated completion in 2017. In accordance with the Company’s policy, the terms of this joint venture and any of our joint ventures with any affiliate have been and will be subject to review and approval by our Audit Committee. As in any joint venture, we could have disagreements with our joint venture partner over the operation of a joint venture or a joint venture could be involved in disputes with third parties, where we may or may not have an identity of interest with our joint venture partner. These relationships also may create conflicts of interest with respect to new business and other corporate opportunities. 21 Index Ronald N. Tutor’s ownership interest in the Company, along with his management position and his right to designate up to two nominees to serve as members of our Board of Directors, provides him with significant influence over corporate matters and may make a third party’s acquisition of the Company (or its stock or assets) more difficult. As of December 31, 2011, Mr. Tutor and two trusts controlled by Mr. Tutor (the “Tutor Group”) owned approximately 22.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. In addition, Mr. Tutor is the chairman and chief executive officer of the Company and has the right to designate up to two nominees for election as members of the Company’s Board of Directors. As of the date of this Form 10-K, none of the current directors have been appointed by Mr. Tutor. Mr. Tutor has advised the Board that should he choose to designate a person for appointment to the Board at a time when the Board already includes eleven members, he would support a temporary expansion of the Board to twelve members to accommodate such additional member. Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement dated April 2, 2008 and amended by Amendments No. 1, 2, and 3 dated September 17, 2010, June 2, 2011 and September 13, 2011, respectively, by and among Tutor Perini Corporation, Mr. Tutor and certain shareholders of Tutor-Saliba Corporation signatory thereto (the “Amended Shareholders Agreement”) such expansion would continue until the next meeting of shareholders at which directors are elected, at which time the size of the Board would be reduced back to eleven members and the slate of nominees for election adjusted accordingly. Additionally, under the Amended Shareholders Agreement Mr. Tutor has the right to designate two nominees for election to the Board only for so long as the Tutor Group owns at least 22.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock and one nominee if the Tutor Group owns less than 22.5% but more than 11.25% of the outstanding shares of common stock. The Amended Shareholders Agreement also imposes significant limits on Mr. Tutor’s right to vote the shares of our common stock held by the Tutor Group or to take specified actions that may facilitate an unsolicited acquisition of control of the Company by Mr. Tutor or his affiliates. Mr. Tutor will nonetheless still be able to exert significant influence over the outcome of a range of corporate matters, including significant corporate transactions requiring a shareholder vote, such as a merger or a sale of the Company or its assets. This concentration of ownership and influence in management and Board decision-making also could harm the price of our common stock by, among other things, discouraging a potential acquirer from seeking to acquire shares of our common stock (whether by making a tender offer or otherwise) or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company. Our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by work stoppages and other labor problems. We are a signatory to numerous local and regional collective bargaining agreements, both directly and through trade associations. If we or our trade associations are unable to negotiate with any of our unions, we might experience strikes, work stoppages or increased operating costs as a result of higher than anticipated wages or benefits. If our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or our non-unionized employees become unionized, we could experience a disruption of our operations and higher ongoing labor costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt agreements, in particular under our $300 million senior unsecured notes and our $200 million term loan under our revolving credit facility. We currently have and expect to continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2011, we have a total debt of approximately $672.5 million, consisting of $298.0 million of senior unsecured notes (net of unamortized debt discount of $2.0 million) (the “Senior Notes”), a $200 million term loan (the “Term Loan”) under our revolving credit facility which has been paid down to $185 million at December 31, 2011, and $189.5 million of other debt. We may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Our substantial indebtedness may: · make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on the Senior Notes, Term Loan and our other indebtedness; 22 Index · limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes; · limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes; · require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; · limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; · place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and · increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We are subject to restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility and the indenture for our $300 million senior unsecured notes that could limit our flexibility in managing the business. Our revolving credit facility imposes operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions include, among other things, limitations on our ability to: · create liens or other encumbrances; · enter into certain types of transactions with our affiliates; · make certain capital expenditures; · make investments, loans or other guarantees; · sell or otherwise dispose of a portion of our assets; or · merge or consolidate with another entity. In addition, our revolving credit facility prohibits us from incurring debt from other sources without the consent of our lenders. Our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum net worth, minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum leverage ratios. Our ability to borrow funds for any purpose is dependent upon satisfying these tests. Our Senior Notes also impose operating and financial restrictions on us including, among other things, the following limitations on our ability to: · incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock; · pay dividends on, or make distributions in respect of, our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock; · make certain investments or other restricted payments; · sell certain assets; · create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; · merge, consolidate or transfer or dispose of substantially all of their assets; or · engage in certain transactions with affiliates If we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or fail to comply with any of the other restrictions contained in these agreements, an event of default could occur. An event of default, if not waived by our lenders, could result in an acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness, causing such debt to become immediately due and payable. If such an acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay such indebtedness on a timely basis. Since indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and Senior Notes is secured by substantially all of our assets, acceleration of this debt could result in foreclosure of those assets. In the event of a foreclosure, we would be unable to conduct our business and may be forced to discontinue ongoing operations. Funds associated with auction rate securities may not be liquid or readily available. As discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements entitled “Fair Value Measurements” included in this report, our investment securities primarily consist of auction rate securities which are not currently liquid or readily available to convert to cash. In conjunction with our estimates of fair value at December 31, 2011, we deemed our investment in auction rate securities to be impaired by $4.8 million in 2011. This impairment was deemed to be other-than-temporary, thereby resulting in a charge to income. If the auction rate securities market continues to remain relatively illiquid, it is possible that we will be required to further adjust the fair value of our auction rate securities. If we determine that the decline in the fair value of our auction rate securities is other-than-temporary, it would result in additional impairment charges being recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, which could be material and which could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, the lack of liquidity associated with these investments may require us to access our revolving credit facility until some or all of our auction rate securities are liquidated. 23 Index We retain a certain level of self-insured risk for workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability and subcontractor default insurance. Therefore, large self-insured losses, associated with several insurable events, could adversely affect our operating results. We self-insure for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from workers' compensation, general liability, automobile liability and certain events of subcontractor default. We maintain insurance coverage with licensed insurance carriers which limits our aggregate exposure to excessive loss experience in a given policy year. In addition, we maintain insurance coverage above the amounts for which we self-insure. We accrue currently for estimated incurred losses and expenses, and periodically evaluate and adjust our claims accrued liability to reflect our experience. However, if excessive loss experience should occur in a policy year or years, ultimate results may differ materially from our estimates, which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flow. Although we believe the level of our insurance coverage should be sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims, it is possible that one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. Also, there are some types of losses such as from hurricanes, terrorism, wars, or earthquakes where insurance is limited and/or not economically justifiable. If an uninsured loss occurs, it could adversely affect our operating results and cash flow. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 24 Index
