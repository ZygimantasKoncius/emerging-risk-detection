Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in shares of our common stock involves various risks. Before deciding to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the items included as exhibits. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks or by other risks that have not been identified or that we may believe are immaterial or unlikely. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Our primary market area depends substantially on the gaming industry, and a downturn in that industry could hurt our business and our prospects. Our business is concentrated in the Lawrenceburg, Indiana, area. Lawrenceburg is the site of a riverboat casino that opened in 1996. The economy of the Lawrenceburg metropolitan area significantly depends on services and industries related to gaming and tourism. Any event that negatively and materially impacts the gaming and tourism industry will adversely impact the Lawrenceburg economy. Gaming revenue is vulnerable to fluctuations in the national economy. A prolonged downturn in the national economy could have a significant adverse effect on the economy of the Lawrenceburg area. Virtually any development or event that could dissuade travel or spending related to gaming and tourism, whether inside or outside of Lawrenceburg, could adversely affect the Lawrenceburg economy. Consequently, the Lawrenceburg economy is more susceptible than the economies of other cities to issues such as higher gasoline and other fuel prices, unemployment levels, recession, rising interest rates, and other economic conditions, whether domestic or foreign. 17 Table of Contents A deterioration in economic conditions generally, and a slowdown in gaming and tourism activities in particular, could result in the following consequences, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and expose us to a greater risk of loss:  Loan delinquencies may increase;  Problem assets and foreclosures may increase;  Demand for our products and services may decline; and  Collateral for loans made by us may decline in value, reducing the amount of money that our customers may borrow against the collateral, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our loans. An expansion of permissible gaming activities in other states, particularly in Kentucky and/or Ohio, may lead to a decline in gaming revenue in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, which could hurt our business and our prospects. Lawrenceburg, Indiana competes with other areas of the country for gaming revenue, and it is possible that the expansion of gaming operations in other states, as a result of changes in laws or otherwise, could significantly reduce gaming revenue in the Lawrenceburg area. This is particularly true if gaming operations were to be authorized in Kentucky and/or Ohio, states from which the Lawrenceburg casino generally draws substantial year-round clientele. Kentucky and/or Ohio legislative proposals could permit gaming activities. The establishment of casino gaming in Kentucky and/or Ohio, or other states, could have a substantial adverse effect on gaming revenue in Lawrenceburg which would adversely affect the Lawrenceburg economy and our business. We rely heavily on municipal deposits as a source of funds and a reduced level of those deposits may hurt our profits. Historically, municipal deposits, consisting primarily of tax revenues from the local river boat casino operations, have been a significant source of funds for our lending and investment activities. At June 30, 2008, $127.5 million, or 39.7% of our total deposits, consisted of municipal deposits. Municipal deposits are generally short-term deposits and are generally considered rate-sensitive instruments. Consequently, if our municipal deposits decrease to a level where we would need to resort to other sources of funds for our lending and investment activities, such as borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, the interest expense associated with these other funding sources may be higher than the rates we pay on the municipal deposits, which would hurt our profits. Our income is subject to inherent risk. Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by our interest-earning assets (consisting primarily of loans and, to a lesser extent, securities) and the interest expense generated by our interest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of deposits and, to a lesser extent, wholesale borrowings). The level of net interest income is a function of the average balance of our interest-earning assets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are affected by such external factors as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (the FOMC) and market interest rates. The cost of our deposits and short-term wholesale borrowings is largely based on short-term interest rates, the level of which is driven by the FOMC. However, the yields on our loans and securities are typically based on intermediate-term or long-term interest rates, which are set by the market and generally vary daily. The level of net 18 Table of Contents interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates, and the pace at which such movements occur. If the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-earning assets, the result could be a reduction in net interest income and with it, a reduction in our earnings. Our net interest income and earnings would be similarly impacted were the interest rates on its interest-earning assets to decline more quickly than the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, such changes in interest rates could affect our ability to originate loans and attract and retain deposits, the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and the average life of our loan and securities portfolios. Changes in interest rates could also have an effect on the slope of the yield curve. A flat to inverted yield curve could cause our net interest income and net interest margin to contract, which could have a material adverse effect on our net income and cash flows and the value of our assets. Changes in interest rates particularly affect the value of our securities portfolio. Generally, the value of fixed-rate securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of equity, net of tax. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on stockholders equity. In addition, we invest in callable securities that expose us to reinvestment risk, particularly during periods of falling market interest rates when issuers of callable securities tend to call or redeem their securities. Reinvestment risk is the risk that we may have to reinvest the proceeds from called securities at lower rates of return than the rates earned on the called securities. Our increased emphasis on multi-family residential and nonresidential real estate and land lending may expose us to increased lending risks. At June 30, 2008, $116.9 million, or 40.3%, of our loan portfolio consisted of multi-family residential and nonresidential real estate and land loans. We have grown our loan portfolio in recent years, particularly with respect to multi-family residential and nonresidential real estate and land loans and intend to continue to emphasize these types of lending. These types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the borrowers. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. In addition, since such loans generally entail greater credit risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future to account for the likely increase in probable incurred credit losses associated with the growth of such loans. Also, many of our multi-family residential and nonresidential real estate and land borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. At June 30, 2008, our largest multi-family residential, nonresidential real estate, or land lending relationship was a $6.0 million commercial real estate loan relationship. This loan relationship was within our maximum lending limit to one borrower at June 30, 2008. If we do not achieve profitability on new branches, the new branches may hurt our earnings. We cannot assure you that our branch expansion strategy and our branch upgrading will increase our earnings in the short term or within a reasonable period of time, if at all. Numerous factors will affect our branch expansion strategy, such as our ability to select suitable branch locations, real estate acquisition costs, competition, interest rates, managerial resources, our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, the effectiveness of our marketing strategy and our ability to attract deposits. It takes time for a new branch to generate significant deposits and loan volume to offset expenses, some of which, like salaries and occupancy expense, are relatively fixed costs. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in increasing the volume of our loans and deposits by expanding our branch network. Building and staffing new branch offices will increase our operating expenses. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to manage the costs and implementation risks associated with this strategy so that expansion of our branch network will be profitable. 19 Table of Contents Strong competition within our market areas could hurt our profits and slow growth. We face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. In particular, several financial institutions have recently opened new offices or branches in Dearborn County, Indiana. This competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and at times has forced us to offer higher deposit rates. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which would reduce net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult to grow loans and deposits. As of June 30, 2007, the most recent date for which information is available, we held 36.26% of the deposits in Dearborn County. Competition also makes it more difficult to hire and retain experienced employees. Some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market areas. We operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations. We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OTS, our primary federal regulator, and by the FDIC, as insurer of our deposits. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage, and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of United Community Bank rather than for holders of United Community Bancorp common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. A decline in our return on equity as a result of the capital we raised in our March 2006 stock offering may negatively impact the value of our common stock. Return on equity, which equals net income divided by average equity, is a ratio used by many investors to compare the performance of a particular company with other companies. For the year ended June 30, 2008, our return on equity was (2.67)%. Over time, we intend to use the net proceeds from our March 2006 stock offering to increase earnings per share and book value per share, without assuming undue risk, with the goal of achieving a return on equity that is competitive with other publicly held subsidiaries of mutual holding companies. This goal could take a number of years to achieve, and we cannot assure you that it will be attained. Consequently, you should not expect a competitive return on equity in the near future. Failure to achieve a competitive return on equity might make an investment in our common stock unattractive to some investors and might cause our common stock to trade at lower prices than comparable companies with higher returns on equity. United Community MHCs majority control of United Community Bancorps common stock enables it to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of stockholders including preventing sale or merger transactions or a second-step conversion transaction you may find advantageous. United Community MHC owns a majority of United Community Bancorps common stock and, through its board of directors, exercises voting control over most matters put to a vote of stockholders. The same directors and officers who will manage United Community Bancorp and United Community Bank also manage United Community MHC. As a federally chartered mutual holding company, the board of directors of United Community MHC must ensure that the interests of depositors of United Community Bank are represented and considered in matters put to a vote of stockholders of United Community Bancorp. Therefore, the votes cast by United Community MHC may not be in your personal best interests as a stockholder. For example, United Community MHC may exercise its voting control to defeat a stockholder nominee for election to the board of directors of United Community Bancorp. In addition, stockholders are not able to force a merger or second-step conversion transaction 20 Table of Contents without the consent of United Community MHC. Some stockholders may desire a sale or merger transaction, since stockholders typically receive a premium for their shares, or a second-step conversion transaction, since fully converted institutions tend to trade at higher multiples than mutual holding companies. OTS policy on remutualization transactions could prohibit acquisition of United Community Bancorp, which may adversely affect our stock price. Current OTS regulations permit a mutual holding company to be acquired by a mutual institution in a remutualization transaction. The possibility of a remutualization transaction has recently resulted in a degree of takeover speculation for mutual holding companies that is reflected in the per share price of mutual holding companies common stock. However, the OTS has issued a policy statement indicating that it views remutualization transactions as raising significant issues concerning disparate treatment of minority stockholders and mutual members of the target entity and raising issues concerning the effect on the mutual members of the acquiring entity. Under certain circumstances, the OTS intends to give these issues special scrutiny and reject applications providing for the remutualization of a mutual holding company unless the applicant can clearly demonstrate that the OTSs concerns are not warranted in the particular case. Should the OTS prohibit or otherwise restrict these transactions in the future, our per share stock price may be adversely affected. OTS regulations and anti-takeover provisions in our charter restrict the accumulation of United Community Bancorps common stock, which may adversely affect our stock price. OTS regulations provide that for a period of three years following the date of the completion of the Reorganization, no person, acting alone or together with associates or in a group of persons acting in concert, may directly or indirectly offer to acquire or acquire the beneficial ownership of more than 10.0% of our common stock without the prior written approval of the OTS. In addition, United Community Bancorps charter provides that, for a period of five years from the date of the reorganization, no person, other than United Community MHC, may acquire directly or indirectly the beneficial ownership of more than 10.0% of any class of any equity security of United Community Bancorp. In the event a person acquires shares in violation of this charter provision, all shares beneficially owned by such person in excess of 10.0% will be considered excess shares and will not be counted as shares entitled to vote or counted as voting shares in connection with any matters submitted to the stockholders for a vote. These factors make it more difficult and less attractive for stockholders to acquire a significant amount of our common stock, which may adversely affect our stock price. Item 1B.
