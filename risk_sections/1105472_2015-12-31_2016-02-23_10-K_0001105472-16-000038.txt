Item 1A. Risk FactorsInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before buying our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline materially and you could lose all or part of your investment.Our quarterly revenue and operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, which could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial statements and the trading price of our common stock.Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. The primary factors that may affect our revenues and operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:•consolidation within the telecommunications industry, including acquisitions of or by our customers;•general economic conditions in our markets, both domestic and international, as well as the level of discretionary IT spending;•competitive conditions in our markets, including the effects of new entrants, consolidation, technological innovation and substantial price discounting;•fluctuation in demand for our products and services, and the timing and size of customer orders;•fluctuations in foreign exchange rates;•cancellation or deferral of existing customer orders or the renegotiation of existing contractual commitments;•mix of product configurations sold;•length and variability of the sales cycle for our products;•application of complex revenue recognition accounting rules to our customer arrangements;•timing of revenue recognition;•changes in our pricing policies, the pricing policies of our competitors and the prices of the components of our products;•market acceptance of new products, product enhancements and services that we offer;•the quality and level of our execution of our business strategy and operating plan, and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs;13Table of Contents•new product announcements, introductions and enhancements by us or our competitors, which could result in deferrals of customer orders;•our ability to develop, introduce, ship and successfully deliver new products and product enhancements that meet customer requirements in a timely manner;•our reliance on contract manufacturers for the production and shipment of our hardware products;•our or our contract manufacturers' ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components or materials;•our ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products;•variability and unpredictability in the rate of growth in the markets in which we compete;•costs related to acquisitions; and•corporate restructurings.Equipment purchases by communications service providers and enterprises continue to be unpredictable. As with other telecommunications product suppliers, we typically recognize a portion of our revenue in a given quarter from sales booked and shipped in the last weeks of that quarter. As a result, delays in customer orders may result in delays in shipments and recognition of revenue beyond the end of a given quarter. Additionally, it can be difficult for us to predict the timing of receipt of major customer orders, and we are unable to control timing decisions made by our customers. Consequently, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict even in the short term and a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter, or in some cases, that year. Therefore, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance we may provide to the market, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could also occur even if we meet our publicly stated revenue and/or earnings guidance.A significant portion of our operating expenses is fixed in the short term. If revenues for a particular quarter are below expectations, we may not be able to reduce costs and expenses proportionally for that quarter. Any such revenue shortfall would, therefore, have a significant effect on our operating results for that quarter.We have incurred net losses and may incur additional net losses.We incurred net losses in each of the first three quarters of 2015 and fiscal year 2015, as well as in fiscal years 2014 and 2013. We may incur additional net losses in future quarters and years. Our revenues may not grow and we may never generate sufficient revenues to sustain profitability.We will not be successful if we do not grow our customer base, especially since our revenue has historically been generated from a limited number of customers and the per-order revenue from orders placed by the majority of our new customers is generally lower than the per-order revenue generated from our historical sales. Additionally, if we are unable to generate recurring business from our existing customers, our consolidated financial statements could be materially and adversely affected.Prior to our acquisition of Network Equipment Technologies, Inc. ("NET") in August 2012, we had shipped our products to a limited number of customers. Since the acquisition of NET, as well as our acquisition of Performance Technologies, Incorporated ("PT") in February 2014, the number of customers to whom we have shipped our products has increased significantly. However, due to the nature of certain of our new product offerings, the per-order revenue from orders placed by the majority of our new customers is generally lower than the per-order revenue generated from our historical sales.Our future success will depend on our ability to attract additional customers beyond our current customer base. One customer, AT&T, contributed more than 10% of our revenue in each of the past three years, representing approximately 13% of our revenue in 2015, 19% of our revenue in 2014 and 15% of our revenue in 2013. Factors that may affect our ability to grow our customer base include but are not limited to the following:•economic conditions that discourage potential new customers from making the capital investments required to adopt new technologies;•deterioration in the general financial condition of service providers and enterprises, or their ability to raise capital or access lending sources;•new product introductions by our competitors; and•the development of our channel partner program.14Table of ContentsIf we are unable to expand our customer base, we will be forced to rely on generating recurring revenue from existing customers, which may not be successful. We expect to derive an increasing percentage of our revenue from engagements with our value-added resellers ("VAR") and global system integration partners; however, in the foreseeable future, the majority of our revenue will continue to depend on sales of our products to a limited number of existing customers or sales to customers with lower per-order revenue than those generated from our historical sales. Factors that may affect our ability to generate recurring revenues from our existing customers include but are not limited to the following:•customer willingness to implement our products;•the timing of industry transitions to new network technologies;•acquisitions of or by our customers;•delays or difficulties that we may incur in completing the development and introduction of our planned products or product enhancements;•failure of our products to perform as expected; and•difficulties we may incur in meeting customers' delivery requirements or with software development, hardware design, manufacturing or marketing of our products and/or services.The loss of any significant customer, or any substantial reduction in purchase orders or deferral of purchasing decisions from these customers, could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.We continue to enhance our sales strategy, which we expect will include more partner sales engagements to resell our products and services through authorized Sonus distributors, value added resellers, system integrators and other channel partners. Disruptions to, or our failure to effectively develop and manage, these partners and the processes and procedures that support them could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products and services. If we do not have adequate personnel, experience and resources to manage the relationships with these partners and to fulfill our responsibilities under such arrangements, such shortcomings could lead to the decrease of the sales of our products and services and our operating results could suffer.We continue to enhance our sales strategy, which we expect will include more partner sales engagements to resell our products and services through authorized Sonus distributors, value added resellers, system integrators and other channel partners. Our future success is dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of distributors, value added resellers, system integrators and other channel partners. We may also need to pursue strategic partnerships with vendors who have broader technology or product offerings in order to compete with end-to-end solution providers. In addition, many of the enterprise markets we are pursuing require a broad network of resale partners in order to achieve effective distribution.Many of our distribution and channel partners sell competitive products and services and the loss of, or reduction in sales by, these partners could materially reduce our revenues. Our sales through channel partners typically involve the use of our products as components of a larger solution being implemented by the systems integrator. In these instances, the purchase and sale of our products are dependent on the channel partner, who typically controls the timing, prioritization and implementation of the project. Project delays, changes in priority or solution re-design decisions by the systems integrator can adversely affect our product sales. If we fail to maintain relationships with our distribution, VAR and systems integration partners; fail to develop new relationships with other partners in new markets; fail to manage, train or provide incentives to our existing partners effectively; or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our products and services may decrease and our operating results could suffer. Moreover, if we do not have adequate personnel, experience and resources to manage the relationships with our partners and to fulfill our responsibilities under such arrangements, any shortcomings could have a material adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial statements.In addition, we recognize some of our revenue based on a sell-through model using information provided by our partners. If those partners provide us with inaccurate or untimely information, the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely affected. We may also experience financial failure of our partners, which could result in our inability to collect accounts receivable in full.As the telecommunications industry and the requirements of our current and potential customers evolve, we are redirecting certain of our resources to more readily respond to the changing environment through the research and development of innovative new products and the improvement of existing products. If our strategic plan is not aligned with the direction our customers take as they invest in the evolution of their networks, customers may not buy our products or use our services.Success in our industry requires large investments in technology and creates exposure to rapid technological and market changes. We spend a significant amount of time, money and resources both developing new technology, products and solutions and acquiring new businesses or business assets, as applicable, such as NET in August 2012 and PT in February 2014. In 15Table of ContentsJanuary 2015, we acquired from Treq Labs, Inc. ("Treq") certain assets related to Treq's business of designing, developing, marketing, selling, servicing and maintaining software-defined networking ("SDN") technology, SDN controller software and SDN management software (the "SDN Business"). Our strategic plan includes a significant shift in our investments from mature technologies that previously generated significant revenue for us toward certain next-generation technologies, as well as working with channel partners to sell our products. In order for us to be successful, our technologies, products and solutions must be accepted by relevant standardization bodies and by the industry as a whole. Our choices of specific technologies to pursue, and those to de-emphasize, may prove to be inconsistent with our customers' investment spending. Our success also depends upon our ability to integrate new and acquired products and services, as well as our ability to enhance our existing products and services. Moreover, if we invest in the development of technologies, products and solutions that do not function as expected, are not adopted by the industry, are not ready in time, are not accepted by our customers as quickly as anticipated or are not successful in the marketplace, our sales and earnings may suffer and, as a result, our stock price could decline. As technology advances, we may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to developments in the market for our products, or new industry standards may emerge and could render our existing or future products and services obsolete. If our products and services become technologically obsolete or if we are unable to develop successor products and services that are accepted by our customers, we may be unable to sell our products and services in the marketplace and face declines in sales. We may also experience difficulties with software development, hardware design, manufacturing or marketing that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements.We believe the telecommunications industry is in the early stages of a major architectural shift to the virtualization of networks. If the architectural shift does not occur, if it does not occur at the pace we predict, or if the products and services we have developed are not attractive to our customers after such shift takes place, our revenues could decline.We believe the telecommunications industry is in the early stages of transitioning to the virtualization of networks, and we are developing products and services that we believe will be attractive to our customers and potential customers who make that shift. While we anticipate that the industry shift to a software-centric cloud-based architecture is all but certain to happen, fundamental changes like this often take time to accelerate. In addition, our customers may adapt to such changes at varying rates. As our customers take time to determine their future network architectures, we may encounter delayed timing of orders, deferred purchasing decisions and reduced expenditures. These longer decision cycles and reduced expenditures may negatively impact our revenues, or make it difficult for us to accurately predict our revenues, either of which could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial statements and cause our stock price to decline.In 2012, the macro-environment for our media gateway trunking business faced significant declining revenues that happened faster than we were anticipating. In the past three years, we continued to experience significant declines in customer spending in our media gateway trunking business, and these declines have continued to date. Even though we continue to transform our company from a media gateway trunking business to an SBC and DSC business, a portion of our current revenue remains dependent upon the commercial success of our voice infrastructure products, which we believe will remain true for the foreseeable future. If the market for these products continues to significantly decline and if our SBC and DSC sales do not accelerate as quickly as we forecast, our operating results could suffer.While we continue to transform our company from a media gateway trunking business to a Session Border Controller ("SBC") and Diameter Signaling Controller ("DSC") business, a portion of our current revenue still depends upon the commercial success of our TDM-to-IP and our all-IP voice infrastructure products and solutions, and we believe this will remain true for the foreseeable future. If the market for these products continues to significantly decline and if our SBC and DSC sales do not accelerate as quickly as we forecast, our operating results could suffer.Restructuring activities could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy.We recorded net restructuring expense of $13.2 million in the aggregate in 2015, 2014 and 2013, comprised of $12.5 million for severance and related costs, $0.5 million for the consolidation of certain facilities and $0.2 million for the write-off of assets associated with the headcount reduction and facilities consolidations. We initiated a new restructuring plan in April 2015 pursuant to which we reduced our workforce by approximately 150 positions, or 12.5% of our worldwide workforce.These restructurings and any future restructurings, should it become necessary for us to continue to restructure our business due to worldwide market conditions or other factors that reduce the demand for our products and services, could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy in a number of ways, including through:•loss of key employees;•diversion of management's attention from normal daily operations of the business;•diminished ability to respond to customer requirements related to both products and services;16Table of Contents•decrease in cash and profits related to severance payments and facility termination costs;•disruption of our engineering and manufacturing processes, which could adversely affect our ability to introduce new products and to deliver products both on a timely basis and in accordance with the highest quality standards; and/or•reduced ability to execute effectively internal administrative processes, including the implementation of key information technology programs.If we fail to realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions of PT and the SDN Business on a timely basis, or at all, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions of PT and/or the SDN Business on a timely basis, or at all, for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to the following:•problems or delays in assimilating or transitioning to us the acquired assets, operations, systems, processes, controls, technologies, products or personnel;•loss of acquired customer accounts;•unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions;•failure to identify in the due diligence process or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities we assumed in the acquisitions, which could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes due, significant issues with product quality or development or other adverse effects on our business or consolidated financial statements;•multiple or overlapping product lines as a result of the acquisitions that are offered, priced and supported differently, which could cause customer confusion and delays;•higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products;•diversion of management’s attention from our core business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations from the acquisitions;•adverse effects on existing business relationships of Sonus, PT and/or the SDN Business with respective suppliers, licensors, contract manufacturers, customers, distributors, resellers and industry experts;•significant impairment, exit and/or restructuring charges if the products or technologies acquired in the acquisitions do not meet our sales expectations or are unsuccessful;•insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisitions;•risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;•potential loss of the employees we acquired in the acquisitions or our own employees; and/or•failure to properly integrate internal controls and financial systems of the combined companies.If we are not able to successfully manage these issues, the anticipated benefits and efficiencies of the PT and/or the SDN Business acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and our ability to compete, our revenue and gross margins and our results of operations may be adversely affected.Any future investments, mergers or acquisitions we make or enter into, as applicable, could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and seriously harm our financial condition.We are not currently a party to any material pending merger or acquisition agreements. However, we may merge with or acquire additional businesses, products or technologies in the future. No assurance can be given that any future merger or acquisition will be successful or will not materially and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. We continue to review opportunities to merge with or acquire other businesses or technologies that would add to our existing product line, complement and enhance our current products, expand the breadth of our markets, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. If we enter into a merger or make acquisitions in the future, we could, among other things:•issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders' percentage ownership;•incur debt or assume liabilities;•reduce significantly our cash and investments;•incur significant impairment charges related to the write-off of goodwill and intangible assets;•incur significant amortization expenses related to intangible assets; and/or•incur large and immediate write-offs for in-process research and development and stock-based compensation.Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we would be successful in overcoming problems in connection with our past or future acquisitions. Our inability to do so could significantly harm our business, revenues, and results of operations.17Table of ContentsIf in the future we do not have a sufficient number of shares available to issue to our employees, the limited number of shares we could issue may impact our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel.We historically have used stock options and restricted stock as a significant component of our employee compensation program in order to align our employees' interests with the interests of our stockholders, encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation packages. In 2007, our stockholders approved our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2007 Plan"), which includes a limited amount of shares to be granted under such plan. Our stockholders approved amendments to the 2007 Plan in June 2010, June 2013, December 2014 and June 2015.If our stockholders do not approve future amendments that we determine are needed to the 2007 Plan or adopt a new stock incentive plan, the limited number of shares available for use as equity incentives to employees may make it more difficult for us to attract, retain and motivate key personnel.Worldwide efforts to contain capital spending, general uncertainty as to slow economic growth during the current post-recessionary global economy, the possibility of another recession and a continued weakened global economy could have a material adverse effect on us.One factor that significantly affects our operating results is the impact of economic conditions on the willingness of our current and potential customers to make capital investments. Given the general uncertainty and slow economic growth during the current post-recessionary global economy, we believe that customers have tried to maintain or improve profitability through cost control and constrained capital spending, which places additional pressure on IT departments to demonstrate acceptable return on investment. Some of our current or prospective customers may cancel or delay spending on the development or roll-out of capital and technology projects with us due to economic uncertainty and, consequently, our results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, current uncertain worldwide economic and political environments make it increasingly difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand, which could result in an inability to satisfy demand for our products and a loss of market share. Our revenues are likely to decline in such circumstances and our profit margins could erode, or we could incur significant losses.Moreover, economic conditions worldwide may contribute to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries, as well as to specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in:•reduced demand for our products and services as a result of our customers choosing to refrain from building capital intensive networks;•increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors, but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products;•risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•excess facilities and manufacturing capacity; and/or•higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense.Continuing turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world, including terrorist activities and military actions, as well as political and economic issues in many regions, continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. Our operating results and our ability to expand into other international markets may also be affected by changing economic conditions particularly germane to that sector or to particular customer markets within that sector.If we fail to compete successfully against telecommunications equipment and networking companies, our ability to increase our revenues and achieve profitability will be impaired.Competition in the telecommunications market is intense. This market has historically been dominated by large incumbent telecommunications equipment companies, such as Ericsson LM Telephone Company and Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., both of which are our direct competitors. We also face competition from other telecommunications and networking companies, including Alcatel Lucent, ALOE Systems Inc., AudioCodes Ltd., Avaya Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Dialogic Inc., F5 Networks, Inc., GENBAND Inc., Metaswitch Networks Corporation, Mitel Networks Corporation, Nokia Systems Network (NSN), Oracle Corporation, Sansay, Inc., Technicolor SA and ZTE Corporation, all of which design competing products. These or other competitors may also merge, intensifying competition. Additional competitors with significant financial resources may enter our markets and further intensify competition.Many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater selling and marketing, technical, manufacturing, financial and other resources than we have. Further, some of our competitors sell significant amounts of other products to our 18Table of Contentscurrent and prospective customers and have the ability to offer lower prices to win business. Our competitors' broad product portfolios, coupled with already existing relationships, may cause our customers to buy our competitors' products or harm our ability to attract new customers.To compete effectively, we must deliver innovative products that:•provide extremely high reliability and quality;•deploy and scale easily and efficiently;•interoperate with existing network infrastructures and multivendor solutions;•provide effective network management;•are accompanied by comprehensive customer support and professional services;•provide a cost-effective and space-efficient solution for enterprises and service providers; and•meet price competition from low cost equipment providers.If we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, we could experience price reductions, order cancellations and loss of customers and revenues, and our operating results could be adversely affected.If we do not anticipate and meet specific customer requirements or if our products do not interoperate with our customers' existing networks, we may not retain current customers or attract new customers.To achieve market acceptance for our products, we must effectively anticipate, and adapt in a timely manner to, customer requirements and offer products and services that meet changing customer demands. Prospective customers may require product features and capabilities that our current products do not have. The introduction of new or enhanced products also requires that we carefully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet anticipated customer demand. If we fail to develop products and offer services that satisfy customer requirements or if we fail to effectively manage the transition from older products, our ability to create or increase demand for our products and services could be seriously harmed and we may lose current and prospective customers.Many of our customers will require that our products be designed to interface with their existing networks, each of which may have different specifications. Issues caused by an unanticipated lack of interoperability may result in significant warranty, support and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our hardware and software development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems. If our products do not interoperate with those of our customers' networks, installations could be delayed or orders for our products could be canceled, which would seriously harm our gross margins and result in loss of revenues or customers. Additionally, our customers may decide to devote a significant portion of their budgets to evolving technology as they consider national or worldwide build-outs. Therefore, if the demand for our products is not strong and if our target customers do not adopt, purchase and successfully deploy our current or planned products, our revenues will not grow.Our large customers have substantial negotiating leverage, and they may require that we agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business.Large communications service providers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us. These customers may, among other things, require us to develop additional features, require penalties for failure to deliver such features, require us to partner with a certain reseller before purchasing our products and/or seek discounted product and/or service pricing. As we sell more products to this class of customer, we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that are less beneficial to us, which may affect the timing of revenue recognition, amount of deferred revenues or product and service margins and may adversely affect our financial position and cash flows in certain reporting periods.Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.The market for technology stocks has been, and will likely continue to be, volatile. The following factors, among others, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly:•addition or loss of any major customer;•continued significant declines in customer spending in the media gateway trunking business;•consolidation and competition in the telecommunications industry;19Table of Contents•changes in the financial condition or anticipated capital expenditure purchases of any existing or potential major customer;•economic conditions for the telecommunications, networking and related industries;•quarterly variations in our bookings, revenues and operating results;•changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;•speculation in the press or investment community;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new products or acquisitions, distribution partnerships, joint ventures, mergers or capital commitments;•activism by any single large stockholder or combination of stockholders;•sales of common stock or other securities by us or by our stockholders in the future;•securities and other litigation;•repurchases under our stock buyback program;•announcement of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or similar event; and/or•emergence or adoption of new technologies or industry standards.Furthermore, brokerage firms often do not permit stocks trading below $5.00 per share to be sold short, but often permit short-selling of shares which are traded at higher prices. As a result, to the extent our per-share trading price is consistently above $5.00, investors may short our stock. This may increase the volatility of our stock price.Our credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (“Bank of America”), as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto, first dated as of June 27, 2014 and as amended on June 26, 2015 (the “Credit Agreement”), contains financial and operating restrictions that may limit our access to credit. If we fail to comply with covenants in the Credit Agreement, we may be required to repay any potential indebtedness thereunder, which may have an adverse effect on our liquidity. In addition, if we are unable to extend, renew or replace the Credit Agreement by the maturity date of June 30, 2016, on favorable terms, or at all, our business, operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.The Credit Agreement provides us with a revolving credit facility of up to $15 million. Provisions in the Credit Agreement impose limitations on our ability to, among other things:•incur additional indebtedness;•create liens; •enter into transactions with affiliates;•dispose of assets;•make certain investments; and•merge or consolidate.In addition, we are required to meet certain financial covenants customary for financings of this type. Our failure to comply with these covenants may result in the declaration of an event of default, which could cause us to be unable to borrow under the Credit Agreement or result in the acceleration of the maturity of indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement at such time. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment or we may not have the ability to borrow or obtain sufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We are also subject to a 0.15% commitment fee on any unused commitments available for borrowing.Furthermore, while we had no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2015, we may wish to draw on this facility in the future. We may be prevented from borrowing, however, if we are unable to extend, renew or replace the Credit Agreement by the maturity date of June 30, 2016, on favorable terms, or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and cause our business, operations and financial condition to suffer.Our business could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property; additionally, in some jurisdictions, our rights may not be as strong as we currently enjoy in the United States.We rely on a combination of security countermeasures within our deployed products, as well as patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. The legal systems of many foreign countries do not protect or honor intellectual property rights to the same extent as the legal system of the United States. It may be very difficult, time-consuming and costly for us to attempt 20Table of Contentsto enforce our intellectual property rights, especially in these foreign jurisdictions. If competitors are able to use our technology, our ability to compete effectively could be harmed.Claims that our current or future products infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others could adversely affect our ability to sell those products and cause us to incur additional costs.Substantial litigation over intellectual property rights exists in the telecommunications industry. We expect that we could be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as our revenue increases, the number of competitors grows and/or the functionality of products and technology in different industry segments overlaps. Third parties may currently have, or may eventually be issued, patents on which our current or future products or technologies may allegedly infringe. For example, there has been an increase in the industry of third-party infringement claims brought by Non-Practicing Entities, also known as patent trolls.In addition, we and our customers have received inquiries from intellectual property owners and may become subject to claims that we or our customers allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Any parties asserting that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights could force us to license their patents for substantial royalty payments or to defend ourselves and possibly our customers or contract manufacturers in litigation. These claims and any resulting licensing arrangement or lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant royalty payments or liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:•stop selling, incorporating or using our products that use the challenged intellectual property;•obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available at acceptable prices, on acceptable terms, or at all; or•redesign those products that use any allegedly infringing technology.Patent litigation, regardless of its outcome, will likely result in the expenditure of significant financial resources and the diversion of management’s time and resources. In addition, patent litigation may cause negative publicity, adversely impact prospective customers, cause product shipment delays, prohibit us from manufacturing, marketing or selling our current or future products, require us to develop non-infringing technology, make substantial payments to third parties or enter into royalty or license agreements, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If a third party's claim of infringement against us in a particular patent litigation is successful, and we could not develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost-effective basis, our revenue may decrease substantially and we could be exposed to significant liability. A court could enter orders that temporarily, preliminarily or permanently enjoin us or our customers from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our current or future products, or could enter an order mandating that we undertake certain remedial activities. Although historically our costs to defend lawsuits relating to indemnification provisions in our product agreements have been insignificant, the costs may be significant in future periods.We may face risks related to litigation that could result in significant legal expenses and settlement or damage awards.From time to time, we are subject to claims and litigation regarding intellectual property rights or other claims, which could seriously harm our business and require us to incur significant costs. On April 6, 2015, Ming Huang, a purported shareholder of ours, filed a Class Action Complaint (Civil Action No. 3:15-02407), alleging violations of the federal securities laws (the "Complaint") in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (the "Court"), against us and two of our officers, Raymond P. Dolan, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark T. Greenquist, our Chief Financial Officer (collectively, the "Defendants"). On September 21, 2015, in response to motions subsequently filed with the Court by four other purported shareholders of ours seeking status as lead plaintiff, the Court appointed Richard Sousa as lead plaintiff (the "Plaintiff") in this case. The Plaintiff claims to represent purchasers of our common stock during the period from October 23, 2014 and March 25, 2015, and seeks unspecified damages. The principal allegation contained in the Complaint is that the Defendants made misleading forward-looking statements concerning our first quarter of 2015 financial performance. On September 22, 2015, we filed a Motion to Transfer this case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (the "Motion to Transfer"). The Plaintiff filed his opposition to the Motion to Transfer on October 5, 2015, and we filed a reply to the Motion to Transfer on October 13, 2015. In the past, we have also been named as a defendant in other securities class action and derivative lawsuits. We are generally obliged, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify our current and former directors and officers who are named as defendants in these lawsuits. Defending against litigation may require significant attention and resources of management. Regardless of the outcome, such litigation could result in significant legal expenses.21Table of ContentsWe may also be subject to employment claims in connection with employee terminations. In addition, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with us may claim that we have engaged in unfair hiring practices. These claims may result in material litigation. We could incur substantial costs defending ourselves or our employees against those claims, regardless of their merits. Further, defending ourselves from those types of claims could divert our management's attention from our operations. The cost of employment claims may also rise as a result of our increasing international expansion.If we are a party to material litigation and if the defenses we claim are ultimately unsuccessful, or if we are unable to achieve a favorable settlement, we could be liable for large damage awards that could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.Actions that may be taken by significant stockholders may divert the time and attention of our Board of Directors and management from our business operations.Campaigns by significant investors to effect changes at publicly-traded companies continue to be prevalent. There can be no assurance that one or more current or future stockholders will not pursue actions to effect changes in our management and strategic direction, including through the solicitation of proxies from our stockholders. If a proxy contest were to be pursued by any stockholder, it could result in substantial expense to us, consume significant attention of our management and Board of Directors, and disrupt our business.Delaware law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders.Some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated by-laws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that may be deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors but that a stockholder may consider favorable. These include provisions:•authorizing the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock;•limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders;•prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent;•permitting the Board of Directors to increase the size of the Board and to fill vacancies;•providing indemnification to our directors and officers;•controlling the procedures for conduct and scheduling of Board and stockholder meetings;•requiring a super-majority vote of our stockholders to amend our amended and restated by-laws and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation; and•establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers or changes in control of us or our management.As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated by-laws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. Although we believe that our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and provisions of Delaware law provide an opportunity for the Board of Directors to assure that our stockholders realize full value for their investment, they could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that some stockholders may consider beneficial.We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.Because a portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we often sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials from sources outside the United States.22Table of ContentsWe may face risks associated with our international expansion that could impair our ability to grow our international revenues. If we fail to manage the operational and financial risks associated with our international operations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.We have expanded, and expect to continue to expand, our operations in international and emerging markets. International operations are a significant part of our business, and such operations will continue to require significant management attention and financial resources to successfully develop direct and indirect international sales and support channels. In addition, our international operations are subject to other inherent risks, including:•reliance on channel partners;•greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer collection cycles;•difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations;•impacts of differing technical standards outside the United States;•compliance with international trade, customs and export control regulations;•reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;•foreign government regulations limiting or prohibiting potential sales or increasing the cost of doing business in such markets, including reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets to new competitors or the introduction of new technologies;•challenging pricing environments in highly competitive new markets;•foreign currency exchange controls, restrictions on repatriation of cash and changes in currency exchange rates;•potentially adverse tax consequences; and•political, social and economic instability, including as a result of the fragility of global financial markets, health pandemics or epidemics and/or acts of war or terrorism.Our international revenue, both as a percentage of total revenue and absolute dollars, may vary from one period to the next, and accordingly, current data may not be indicative of future periods. If we are unable to support our business operations in international and emerging markets, or their further expansion, while balancing the higher operational and financial risks associated with these markets, our business and consolidated financial statements could be harmed.In addition, we may not be able to develop international market demand for our products, which could impair our ability to grow our revenues. In many international markets, long-standing relationships between potential customers and their local suppliers and protective regulations, including local content requirements and approvals, create barriers to entry. We have limited experience marketing, distributing and supporting our products in certain international locations and, to do so, we expect that we will need to develop versions of our products that comply with local standards. Moreover, difficulties in foreign financial markets and economies and of foreign financial institutions, particularly in emerging markets, could adversely affect demand from customers in the affected countries.We depend upon contract manufacturers and any disruption in these relationships may cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships. Additionally, in the event we elect to consolidate and/or change any of our manufacturers, qualifying a new contract manufacturer to commence commercial scale production or consolidating to a reduced number of contract manufacturers are expensive and time-consuming activities and could affect our business.While we currently work with three contract manufacturers, we primarily rely upon one large global manufacturer to assemble our products according to our specifications and to fulfill orders on a timely basis. Reliance on a third-party manufacturer involves a number of risks, including a lack of control over the manufacturing process, inventory management and the potential absence or unavailability of adequate capacity. We do not have the internal manufacturing capabilities to meet our customers' demands. Any difficulties or failures to perform by our contract manufacturers could cause delays in customer product shipments or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations.In connection with the acquisition of PT in 2014, we increased the number of contract manufacturers we worked with from three to four contract manufacturers. However, by December 31, 2014, we had reduced the number of contract manufacturers to three. Additionally, we switched from one single-source manufacturer to another in 2009, as well as in 2011. Any future changes to or consolidations of our current contract manufacturers could lead to material shortages or delays in the supply of our products. In the event we elect to continue to consolidate and/or change any of our manufacturers, qualifying a new contract manufacturer to commence commercial scale production or consolidating to a reduced number of contract manufacturers are expensive and time-consuming activities and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our products. If a change in contract manufacturers results in delays in our fulfillment of customer orders or if a contract manufacturer fails to make timely delivery of orders, we may lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships.23Table of ContentsWe and our contract manufacturers rely on single or limited sources for supply of some components of our products and if we fail to adequately predict our manufacturing requirements or if our supply of any of these components is disrupted, we will be unable to ship our products.We and our contract manufacturers currently purchase several key components of our products, including commercial digital signal processors, from single or limited sources. Single-source and limited source manufacturing arrangements are of a nature that ordinarily accompanies the type of business we conduct. Nevertheless, depending upon the component, there may or may not be alternative sources of substitutes. We purchase these components on a purchase order basis. If we overestimate our component and finished goods requirements, we could have excess inventory, which would increase our costs. If we underestimate our requirements, we may not have an adequate supply, which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenues. Additionally, if any of our contract manufacturers underestimates our requirements, they may not have an adequate supply, which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments. If any of our sole or limited source suppliers experiences capacity constraints, work stoppages or other reductions or disruptions in output, they may not be able to meet, or may choose not to meet, our delivery schedules. Moreover, we have agreed to compensate our contract manufacturers in the event of termination or cancellation of orders, discontinuance of product or excess material.We currently do not have long-term supply contracts with our component suppliers and they are not required to supply us with products for any specified periods, in any specified quantities or at any set price, except as may be specified in a particular purchase order. In the event of a disruption or delay in supply, or inability to obtain products, we may not be able to develop an alternate source in a timely manner or at favorable prices, or at all. While we regularly monitor our inventory of supplies, a failure to find acceptable alternative sources could hurt our ability to deliver high-quality products to our customers and negatively affect our operating margins.Reliance on our suppliers exposes us to potential supplier production difficulties, quality variations and unforeseen price increases. Our customers rely upon our ability to meet committed delivery dates, and any disruption in the supply of key components would seriously adversely affect our ability to meet these dates and could result in loss of customers, harm to our ability to attract new customers, or legal action by our customers. Defense-expedite rated orders from the U.S. federal government, which by law receive priority, can also interrupt scheduled shipments to our other customers. Additionally, any unforeseen price increases could reduce our profitability or force us to increase our prices, which could result in a loss of customers or harm our ability to attract new customers and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.Our customer contracts also generally allow customers to reschedule delivery dates or cancel orders within certain time frames before shipment without penalty and outside those times frames with a penalty. Because of these and other factors, there are risks of excesses or inadequate inventory that could negatively affect our expenses, revenue and earnings.The market for some of our products depends on the availability and demand for other vendors' products.Some of our products, particularly those addressing the Unified Communications market, are designed to function with other vendors' products. In these cases, demand for our products is dependent upon the availability, demand for, and sales of the other vendors' products, as well as the degree to which our products successfully interoperate with the other vendors' products and add value to the solution being provided to the customer. If the other vendors change the design of their products, delay the issuance of new releases, fail to adequately market their products, or are otherwise unsuccessful in building a market for their products, the demand for our products will be adversely affected.If we fail to hire and retain needed personnel, the implementation of our business plan could slow or our future growth could be jeopardized.Our business depends upon highly skilled technical, managerial, engineering, sales, marketing and customer support personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially during times of economic recovery or growth. Any failure to hire, assimilate in a timely manner and retain needed qualified personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, could impair our growth and make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions.Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers who have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely on to implement our business plan. With the exception of certain key employees based in the European Union, none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term. The loss 24Table of Contentsof the services of any of our officers or key employees could delay the development and introduction of, and negatively impact our ability to sell, our products and achieve our business objectives.We had five executive departures in 2015: the departures of our Vice President, Finance, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer; our Vice President and General Manager, Products; our Vice President and General Manager, Global Services; our Chief Information Officer; and our Vice President, Global Marketing. We had one executive departure in 2014: the departure of our Executive Vice President of Strategy and Go-to-Market. We had two executive departures in 2013: the departures of our Senior Vice President, Global Services and Systems Management and our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. While we have since hired replacements and/or promoted certain individuals, there is always a risk of uncertainty and instability relating to our ability to find highly qualified successors for certain executive positions and to transition the duties and responsibilities of any departing key executive in an orderly manner.If we are not able to obtain necessary licenses or on-going maintenance and support of third-party technology at acceptable prices, on acceptable terms, or at all, it could harm our operating results or business.We have incorporated third-party licensed technology, including open source software, into our current products. From time to time, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements. Third-party licenses and on-going maintenance and support may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or may be available to us but only at significantly escalated pricing. Additionally, we may not be able to replace the functionality provided by third-party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete, defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated. The inability to maintain or re-license any third-party licenses required in our current products or to obtain any new third-party licenses to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost, and delay or prevent us from making these products or enhancements, any of which could seriously harm the competitiveness of our products. Any significant interruption in the availability of these third-party software products or defects in these products could harm our sales unless and until we can secure an alternative source. Although we believe there are adequate alternate sources for the technology licensed to us, such alternate sources may not provide us with the same functionality as that currently provided to us.We test our products before they are deployed. However, because our larger scale products are sophisticated and designed to be deployed in complex networks, they may have errors or defects that we find only after full deployment, which could seriously harm our business.Our larger scale products are sophisticated and are designed to be deployed in large and complex networks. We test our products before they are deployed. However, because of the nature of our products, they can only be fully tested when substantially deployed in very large networks with high volumes of traffic. Some of our customers may discover errors or defects in the software or hardware, or the products may not operate as expected after full deployment. As we continue to expand our distribution channel through distributors and resellers, we will need to rely on and support their service and support organizations. If we are unable to fix errors or other performance problems that may be identified after full deployment of our products, we could experience:•loss of, or delay in, revenues or increased expense;•loss of customers and market share;•failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance for our products;•increased service, support and warranty costs and a diversion of development resources; and/or•costly and time-consuming legal actions by our customers.Because our larger scale products are deployed in large, complex networks around the world, failure to establish a support infrastructure and maintain required support levels could seriously harm our business.Our larger scale products are deployed in large and complex networks around the world. Our customers expect us to establish a support infrastructure and maintain demanding support standards to ensure that their networks maintain high levels of availability and performance. To continue to support our customers with these larger scale products, our support organization will need to provide service and support at a high level throughout the world. If we are unable to provide the expected level of support and service to our customers, we could experience:•loss of customers and market share;•failure to attract new customers in new markets and geographies;•increased service, support and warranty costs and a diversion of development resources; and/or25Table of Contents•network performance penalties.A portion of our revenue is generated from sales to U.S. federal government agencies. Disruptions to, or our failure to effectively develop, manage and maintain our government customer relationships could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from the sales of certain of our products. Further, such government sales are subject to potential delays and cutbacks, require specific testing efforts, and impose significant compliance obligations.A portion of our total revenue from product sales comes from contracts with U.S. federal government agencies. None of our current government contracts include long-term purchase commitments. Government sales is a relatively new line of business for us due to our acquisition of NET in August 2012 and our acquisition of PT in February 2014, and disruptions to, or our failure to effectively develop, manage and maintain our government customer relationships, could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from the sales of our products.A majority of NET's government sales involve products that have or will soon reach the end of their life cycles, and such government sales for these older products have declined substantially in recent periods. While governmental agencies have purchased and are evaluating some of our new products for broader deployment, this new line of business may not develop quickly, if at all, or be sufficient to offset future declines in sales of these legacy products. Spending by government customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget.Among the factors that could impact federal government spending and which would reduce our federal government contracting and subcontracting business are a significant decline in, or reapportioning of, spending by the federal government; changes, delays or cancellations of federal government programs or requirements; the adoption of new laws or regulations that affect companies that provide services to the federal government; federal government shutdowns or other delays in the government appropriations process; changes in the political climate, including with regard to the funding of products we provide; and general economic conditions. The loss or significant curtailment of any government contract or subcontracts, whether due to our performance or due to interruptions of or changes in governmental funding for such contracts or subcontracts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The Department of Defense ("DOD") has issued specific requirements for IP networking products for features and interoperability. In order for a vendor's product to be used to connect to the DOD network, that product must pass a series of significant tests and be certified by the Joint Interoperability Test Command (“JITC”). Certain of our products are already certified by JITC, including the Sonus SBC 5110 and the Sonus SBC 5210 session border controllers, as well as the VX900 VoIP Secure Voice Gateway. However, if we are unable to obtain JITC certification as needed, our DOD sales, and hence our revenue and results of operations, may suffer.Consolidation in the telecommunications industry could harm our business.The telecommunications industry has experienced consolidation, including the acquisition of Aruba Networks, Inc. by HP Inc. in May 2015, the acquisition of Mavenir Systems, Inc. by Mitel Networks Corporation in April 2015, the acquisition of Riverbed Technology, Inc. by Thoma Bravo, a private equity investment firm, in April 2015, the acquisition of Dialogic Inc. by Novacap TMT IV, L.P. in 2014 and the acquisitions of Acme Packet, Inc. and Tekelec by Oracle Corporation in 2013, and we expect this trend to continue. Consolidation among our customers may cause delays or reductions in capital expenditure plans and/or increased competitive pricing pressures as the number of available customers declines and the relative purchasing power of customers increases in relation to suppliers. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business.We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in fragile financial markets, which could result in material losses.Due to our reliance on significant customers, we are dependent on the continued financial strength of our customers. If one or more of our significant customers experience financial difficulties, it could result in uncollectable accounts receivable and our loss of significant customers and anticipated revenue.Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 to 60 days. We monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seeking to limit such open credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. However, there can be no assurance that our open credit customers will pay the amounts they owe to us or that the reserves we maintain will be adequate to cover such credit exposure. Our customers' failure to pay and/or our failure to maintain sufficient reserves could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, in the event that turmoil in the credit 26Table of Contentsmarkets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers' ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial statements.A portion of our sales is derived through our distributors. As distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and end-user customers, they generally represent sources of increased credit risk.The hardware products that we purchase from our third-party vendors have life cycles, and some of those products have reached the end of their life cycles. If we are unable to correctly estimate future requirements for these products, it could harm our operating results or business.Some of the hardware products that we purchase from our third-party vendors have reached the end of their life cycles. It may be difficult for us to maintain appropriate levels of the discontinued hardware to adequately ensure that we do not have a shortage or surplus of inventory of these products. If we do not correctly forecast the demand for such hardware, we could have excess inventory and may need to write off the costs related to such purchases. The write-off of surplus inventory could materially and adversely affect our operating results. However, if we underestimate our forecast and our customers place orders to purchase more products than are available, we may not have sufficient inventory to support their needs. If we are unable to provide our customers with enough of these products, it could make it difficult to retain certain customers, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Man-made problems, such as computer viruses, hacking or terrorism, and natural disasters may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.Despite our implementation of network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. Any attack on our servers could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements. Additionally, the information systems of our customers could be compromised due to computer viruses, break-ins and hacking, which could lead to unauthorized tampering with our products and may result in, among other things, the disruption of our customers' business, errors or defects occurring in the software due to such unauthorized tampering, and our products not operating as expected after such unauthorized tampering. Such consequences could affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements. Efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the Internet or undermine our own security efforts may be met with resistance. In addition, the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the economies of the United States and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business and consolidated financial statements. Likewise, events such as work stoppages or widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts. Such disruptions or uncertainties could result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.Natural catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, fire, floods, or tornadoes, may also affect our or our customers' operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, one of our offices is located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. These facilities are located near the San Francisco Bay where the water table is quite close to the surface and where tenants in nearby facilities have experienced water intrusion problems. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake or flood, could have a material adverse effect on our business in this location.A breach of the security of our information systems or those of our third-party providers could adversely affect our operating results.We rely upon the security of our information systems and, in certain circumstances, those of our third-party providers, such as vendors, consultants and contract manufacturers, to protect our proprietary information and information of our customers. Despite our security procedures and those of our third-party providers, our information systems and those of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to threats such as computer hacking, cyber-terrorism or other unauthorized attempts by third parties to access, modify or delete our or our customers' proprietary information. Information technology system failures, including a breach of our or our third-party providers' data security measures, or the theft or loss of laptops, other mobile devices or electronic records used to back up our systems or our third-party providers' systems, could result in an unintentional disclosure of customer, employee, or our information or otherwise disrupt our ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing, among other things, delays in the fulfillment or cancellation of customer orders or disruptions in the manufacture or shipment of products or delivery of services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. These types of security breaches could also create exposure to lawsuits, regulatory investigations, increased legal liability and/or reputational damage. Such consequences could be exacerbated if we or our third-party providers are unable to adequately recover critical systems following a systems failure.27Table of ContentsFailure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could impair our ability to report accurate financial results and could seriously harm our business.Even an effective internal control system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations - including the possibility of the circumvention or overriding of controls - and therefore, can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. The failure or circumvention of our controls, policies and procedures could impair our ability to report accurate financial results and could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.Any changes to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may cause adverse fluctuations in our reported results of operations or affect how we conduct our business.A change in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements, taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation rules have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. The change to existing rules, future changes, if any, or the need for us to modify a current tax position may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. For example, a new revenue recognition standard was issued in 2014 that will be effective for companies in 2018, and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Changes in our business strategy related to product and maintenance offerings and pricing could affect revenue recognition.Our business strategy and competition within the industry could exert pricing pressure on our product and maintenance offerings. Changes in our product or maintenance offerings or packages and related pricing could affect the amount of revenue recognized in a reporting period.If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.Under generally accepted accounting principles, we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our intangible assets increased by approximately $11 million in 2015 as a result of our acquisition of the SDN Business, $17 million in 2014 as a result of our acquisition of PT and $17 million in 2012 as a result of our acquisition of NET. Goodwill, which increased by approximately $1 million as a result of our acquisition of the SDN Business, $7 million as a result of our acquisition of PT (net of the reduction of goodwill related to the sale of PT's Multi-Protocol Server business) and $27 million as a result of our acquisition of NET, is tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include significant underperformance relative to plan or long-term projections, strategic changes in business strategy, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant change in circumstances relative to a large customer, significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and decline in our market capitalization to below net book value.Failure by our strategic partners or by us in integrating products provided by our strategic partners could harm our business.Our solutions include the integration of products supplied by strategic partners, who offer complementary products and services. We rely on these strategic partners in the timely and successful deployment of our solutions to our customers. If the products provided by these partners have defects or do not operate as expected, if the services provided by these partners are not completed in a timely manner, or if we do not effectively integrate and support products supplied by these strategic partners, then we may have difficulty with the deployment of our solutions that may result in:•loss of, or delay in, revenues;•increased service, support and warranty costs and a diversion of development resources; and•network performance penalties.In addition to cooperating with our strategic partners on specific customer projects, we also may compete in some areas with these same partners. If these strategic partners fail to perform or choose not to cooperate with us on certain projects, in addition to the effects described above, we could experience:•loss of customers and market share; and28Table of Contents•failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance for our products.Our use and reliance upon research and development resources in India may expose us to unanticipated costs and/or liabilities.We have a material office in Bangalore, India. The employees at this facility consist principally of research and development personnel. There is no assurance that our reliance upon development resources in India will enable us to achieve meaningful cost reductions or greater resource efficiency. Further, our development efforts and other operations in India involve significant risks, including:•difficulty hiring and retaining appropriate engineering and management resources due to intense competition for such resources and resulting wage inflation;•knowledge transfer related to our technology and resulting exposure to misappropriation of intellectual property or information that is proprietary to us, our customers and other third parties;•heightened exposure to changes in economic, security and political conditions in India; and•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and tax compliance in India.Difficulties resulting from the factors noted above and other risks related to our operations in India could increase our expenses, impair our development efforts, harm our competitive position and damage our reputation.Failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the UK Bribery Act could subject us to significant civil or criminal penalties.We earn a significant portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign direct and indirect operations. As a result, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the "FCPA"), and the UK Bribery Act of 2010 (the "UKBA"), which are laws that prohibit bribery in the conduct of business. The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect the transactions of the company. The FCPA applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. The UKBA is much broader and prohibits all bribery, in both the public and private sectors. Although the UKBA does not contain a separate financial records provision, such a requirement is captured under other UK legislation. Under the FCPA and the UKBA, U.S. companies, their subsidiaries, employees, senior officers and/or directors may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. In addition, the U.S. government or the UK government, as applicable, may seek to hold us liable for successor liability violations committed by companies in which we acquire. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA and the UKBA, governmental authorities in the United States and the United Kingdom, as applicable, could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and consolidated financial statements.Compliance with new regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.In August 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals (referred to as "conflict minerals" regardless of their actual country of origin) in their products. These metals, which include tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten, are central to the technology industry and are present in our products as component parts. As a result, we are required to investigate and disclose whether or not the conflict minerals that are used in our products originated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. There are various costs associated with these investigation and disclosure requirements, in addition to the potential costs of changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such activities. In addition, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement or if we are unable to replace any conflict minerals used in our products that are sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, as there may not be any acceptable alternative sources of the conflict minerals in question or alternative materials that have the properties we need for our products. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier and we may have to write off inventory in the event that it cannot be sold. These changes could also have an adverse impact in our ability to manufacture and market our products.29Table of ContentsWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability, require a license from the U.S. government or impair our ability to compete in international markets.Our products are subject to U.S. export controls and may be exported outside the United States only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products. Under these laws and regulations, we are responsible for obtaining all necessary licenses or other approvals, if required, for exports of hardware, software and technology, as well as the provision of service. Obtaining export licenses can be difficult and time-consuming, and in some cases a license may not be available on a timely basis or at all.In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers' ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether. Any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.Regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future prospects.The telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications industry. Currently, there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or delivery of voice services on IP networks. We could be adversely affected by regulation of IP networks and commerce in any country where we operate, including the United States. Such regulations could include matters such as voice over the Internet or using Internet protocol, encryption technology, and access charges for service providers. The adoption of such regulations could decrease demand for our products, and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.Item 1B.
