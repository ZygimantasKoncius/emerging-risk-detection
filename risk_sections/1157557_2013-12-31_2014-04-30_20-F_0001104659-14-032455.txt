Risk factors  Risks relating to Cemig  We are controlled by the State Government, which may have interests that are different from those of investors. On December 31, we had 47 holders of common shares registered in the United States, holding a total of 8,832,711 common shares. We also had 350 holders of preferred shares registered in the United States, holding a total of 331,393,532 preferred shares. These figures do not include the 199,896,466 preferred shares and 741,165 common shares represented by ADRs. Although our by-laws do not make any restriction on a change in our control, under the legislation of Minas Gerais State such a change will require a state law authorizing the change of control. Because we are a company controlled by the State, the sale of more than 50% of the voting stock of Cemig by the state government, or any other transaction that could transfer the control of the company (in whole or in part), requires approval by legislation specifically authorizing this change, made by the legislative power of Minas Gerais, approved by a minimum 60% of the members of the State Assembly. Such authorization must also be approved by the local citizens in a referendum. On April 15, 2010, Lazard Asset Management LLC notified us that it had acquired 17,497,213 shares, or 5.01% of the total shares issued by Cemig. On February 4, 2011, Lazard Asset Management LLC notified us that it had increased its holding in Cemig to 7.46%, a total of 28,673,232 shares. On January 20, 2012, Lazard Asset Management LLC notified us that it holds 28,266,233 shares, or 4.14% of the Companys total shares in circulation. On June 18, 2010 AGC Energia notified occurrence of the transfer of shares under the Share Purchase Agreements signed by Southern and AGC Energia, with AGC as consenting party, on November 12, 2009. AGC Energia acquired from Southern 98,321,592 common shares issued by Cemig, representing 32.96% of the voting capital and 14.41% of the total share capital. AGC Energia emphasized that this transaction does not change the stockholding control or the administrative structure of Cemig. 105 Table of Contents On August 1, 2011, AGC Energia and the State of Minas Gerais entered into a stockholders agreement (recognized by Cemig and with BNDESPar as the third beneficiary), under which AGC Energia has the right to appoint Cemigs Chief Business Development Officer, subject to approval by the State of Minas Gerais. For more information, see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements. On March 26, 2013 the FIA Dinâmica Energia Fund notified us that it had acquired 19,074,800 common shares, equivalent at that time to 5.1% of the voting stock of Cemig. We are not aware of any other significant alterations in percentage stockholding by holders of our shares amounting to 5% or more of our voting shares in circulation during the last three years. Related Party Transactions The principal balances and transactions with related parties of Cemig and its subsidiaries and jointly-controlled subsidiaries are: · Transactions in electricity between generators and distributors are through auctions organized by the federal government; transport of electricity by transmission companies take place under the centralized operation of the National Electricity System Operator (ONS). These transactions thus take place on terms equivalent to those of arms length transactions. · Injection of the credits of the CRC into a Receivables Fund in senior and subordinated units. See more information in Explanatory Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. · Private issue of R$ 120 in non-convertible debentures, updated by the IGPM inflation index, for completion of the Irapé hydroelectric plant, with redemption 25 years from the issue date.

The amounts are estimated as a percentage of the Companys payroll. · Contribution by the sponsor to the employees Health Plan and Dental Plan. · Rental of the head office building. Item 8. Financial Information Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information Please refer to our financial statements that appear beginning on page F-1 of this document as well as Item 3, Key InformationSelected Consolidated Financial Data. Legal Proceedings We are a party to certain administrative and court proceedings involving tax, regulatory, consumer, administrative, environmental, labor obligations and other liabilities relating to our business. In accordance with IFRS, we record and disclose the aggregate amounts of the proceedings that we have determined a loss to probable, and disclose the aggregate amounts of the proceedings that we have determined a loss to be possible;  in both cases, to the extent these amounts can be reasonably estimated. For more information regarding such contingencies, see Notes to our consolidated financial statements. (i) Regulatory Matters Cemig and Cemig Distribution are parties in 215 lawsuits seeking to nullify the clause in the Electricity Supply Contracts for public illumination, signed with various municipalities in our concession area. Claims also seek restitution of the difference representing the amounts charged in the last 20 years, in the event that the courts recognize that these amounts were unduly charged. Proceedings are based on an alleged mistake in estimating time used for the calculation of the consumption of electricity by public illumination paid 106 Table of Contents for by the Public Illumination Contribution (CIP). On December 31, 2013, the amount involved in this action was, approximately, R$1.3 billion, and we have assessed the chances of loss as possible. Cemig Generation and Transmission filed an application for an order of mandamus to be included as a defendant party in a lawsuit brought by AES Sul against Aneel, seeking the annulment of Aneel Dispatch 288/2002 which sets the guidelines for interpretation of Aneel Resolution 290/2000, and thus change the situation of AES Sul Distribuidora, from creditor to debtor of Mercado Atacadista de Energia (MAE), predecessor of CCEE. Our application to be joined as a defendant was based on the fact that if AES Sul were to be successful in this lawsuit and were found to be a creditor of CCEE, Cemig Generation and Transmission will have to pay the amount applied for by AES Sul. Cemig Generation and Transmission obtained an interim remedy to suspend the deposit that had been ordered in the process of financial settlement, for the historic amount, and was also admitted as a defendant party. As of December 31, 2013, the amount involved in this action was R$146 million, and we have assessed the chances of loss as possible. Cemig Generation and Transmission and its subsidiaries are represented by the Brazilian Association of Independent Power Producers - APINE in a lawsuit in which the association intended to be judicially declared invalidity of Articles 2 and 3 CNPE Resolution 3 , 06/03/2013 which provide, in summary, that the National System Operator - ONS may additionally indicated by the computer programs, dispatching energy resources or change the direction of the exchange between submarkets and that the additional cost of the order will be divided among all market agents, proportionally to the energy sold. Such determinations represent burden to generators agents in the market, which led, by their associations, including the APINE, to court questioning the legality of this Resolution. The lawsuit is at the first level of trial. On December 31, 2013, the amount involved in this action, considering Cemig Generation and Transmission and its subsidiaries, as disclosed in the financial report of Cemig, was, approximately, R$109 million, and we have assessed the chance of loss as possible. Cemig Generation and Transmission filed an injunction against an act of the Minister of Mines and Energy seeking to ensure the right on the extension of the concession period of the Hydropower Plant Jaguara (HPP Jaguara), pursuant to Section 4 of the Agreement Concession No. 007/1997, in accordance to the original Concession Agreement, prior to Law No. 12.783/2013. We obtained an injunction provision, still in force, to keep the commercial exploitation of UHE Jaguara until this injunction is dismissed. On December 31, 2013, we have assessed the chance of loss as possible, considering it is a leading case in the discussion of the judiciary on the extension of concessions. Rate Increases Cemig Distribution is a party, together with Aneel, in a civil public action brought by the Public Attorneys Office seeking to prevent the exclusion of consumers from being classified in the Low Income Residential Tariffs subclass and also to require Cemig Distribution to pay double the amount overpaid by the low income consumers. The lower court found in favor of the Public Attorneys Office, and Cemig Distribution and Aneel appealed to the Regional Federal Appeals Court (Tribunal Regional Federal). The decision of the appeals court on the proceeding has been pending since March 2008. On December 31, 2013, the amount involved in this action was, approximately, R$142.4 million, and we have assessed the chance of loss as possible. Cemig Distribution is a defendant in several lawsuits and, in particular, in a public civil action brought by the Municipal Association for Protection of the Consumer and the Environment (Associação Municipal de Proteção ao Consumidor e ao Meio Ambiente  Amprocom), which is challenging the tariff readjustment applied after 2002 and its methodology and seeking the restitution, to all consumers who were damaged in the processes of periodic review and annual adjustment of electricity tariffs in the period from 2002 to 2009, of the amounts that were allegedly unduly charged. On December 31, 2013, the amount involved in these actions was R$182.4 million, and we have assessed the chances of loss as possible. (ii) Taxes and Other Contributions CEMIG and its subsidiaries are parties in several administrative and judicial tax-related proceedings concerning the imposition of state sales tax (Imposto Sobre a Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços, or ICMS), rural real estate ownership tax (Imposto Sobre a Propriedade Territorial Rural, or ITR), contribution for social integration (Programa de Integração Social, or PIS), PASEP and COFINS (which are taxes on gross sales revenue), the Social Contribution on Net Profit (Contribuição Social Sobre o Lucro Líquido, or CSLL), and federal income tax (Imposto de Renda da Pessoa Jurídica, or IRPJ), among others. In 2006, CEMIG, Cemig Generation and Transmission and Cemig Distribution advanced funds to some of their employees in exchange for their rights to future payments, referred to as the Anuênio. No income tax or social security contributions were collected in connection with those payments, since it is our opinion that they are not applicable. The Brazilian Federal Revenue Service, however, has initiated an administrative proceeding seeking to levy taxes on such payments. In order to avoid the risk of imposition of penalties, we filed two writs of mandamus which were decided unfavorably to us in the lower court. We filed the appropriate appeals and are still waiting for resolution from the upper court. On December 31, 2013, the amount involved in these actions was, approximately, R$218.8 million, and we have assessed the chance of loss as possible, in view of the indemnity nature of the advance payments made to the employees and the absence of specific case law in the upper court. We emphasize that, in 107 Table of Contents relation to Income Tax, both the Superior Court of Justice (STJ) and the Regional Federal Court (TRF) adopt the position that there is tax levied on payments arising from the suppression of employees collective bargaining rights when agreed through a collective agreement, since such amounts are considered indemnities. The INSS initiated an administrative proceeding against CEMIG in 2006 alleging non-payment of the social security contribution on the amounts paid to the Companys employees and directors as profit-sharing in the period 2000 to 2004. In 2007, we filed a writ of mandamus seeking declaration that such profit-sharing payments were not subject to social security contributions. We received a partially favorable decision in 2008, which declared the non-applicability of the contribution of social security on the profit-sharing amounts paid for employees and its applicability on the profit-sharing amounts paid to directors. We have appealed the decision and are waiting for the upper court to decide. On December 31, 2012, the amount involved in this action was assessed as approximately R$519 thousands, which relates only to the judicial deposit made of social security contributions on profit-sharing amounts paid to directors, and we have assessed the chance of loss as possible. However, despite lower court decision being favorable to the Company, the ground used is contrary to higher courts current position, what led us to re-assess the amount involved in this action. On December 31, 2013, the amount involved in this action was, approximately, R$130.9 million, which relates to the payment of social security contributions on profit sharing paid to directors and employees, and we have assessed the chance of loss as possible. The Brazilian Federal Revenue Service has initiated several administrative proceedings against CEMIG, Cemig Generation and Transmission and Cemig Distribution, in relation to the social security contributions allegedly owed in connection with employee profit share payments, the Workers Food Program (PAT), the auxiliary contribution for education, overtime payments, risk exposure compensation payments, Sest/Senat, and compensation penalty payments. We have presented defenses and await judgment. On December 31, 2013, proceedings where we assessed the chances of loss as possible totaled, approximately, R$693.3 million, and proceedings where we assessed the chances of loss as probable totaled, approximately, R$12.5 million. Cemig and Cemig Distribution were, jointly with various consumers, parties in various administrative and judicial proceedings related to ICMS matters, in which were discussed the non-applicability of ICMS over (i) Tarifa de Uso do Sistema da Distribuição (TUSD); (ii) unused portions of hired electricity availability; and (iii) the transfer of excess electricity in the period of rationing of electricity. Except for the proceedings initiated by the consumers against the State of Minas Gerais, Cemig and Cemig Distribuition, where, on December 31, 2013, we assessed the chances of loss as possible totaled, approximately, R$1.1 million, most of such proceedings were dismisses with an agreement entered by and among the State of Minas Gerais, Cemig and Cemig Distribuition, which resulted in sizable reduction in accrued amounts as described below. On December 31, 2013, proceedings related to the non-applicability of ICMS over unused portions of hired electricity availability, where we assessed the chances of loss as possible totaled, approximately, R$1.1 million. December 31, 2013, proceedings related to the impact of ICMS on TUSD, where we assessed the chances of loss as possible totaled, approximately, R$0.002 million. On December 31, 2013, proceedings related to ICMS tax on the transfer of excess electricity in the period of rationing of electricity, where we assessed the chances of loss as probable totaled, approximately, R$ 0.007 million, and proceedings where we assessed the chances of loss as possible totaled, approximately, R$ 1.8 million. CEMIG, Cemig Generation and Transmission and Cemig Distribution are parties in several administrative proceedings the final decisions in which have refused offsetting of credits of IRPJ, CSLL, PIS and COFINS. We are contesting the related tax postings made by the federal tax authority. On December 31, 2013, proceedings where we assessed the chances of loss as probable totaled, approximately, R$ 0.059 million, and proceedings where we have assessed the chances of loss as possible, totaled, approximately, R$302.2 million. CEMIG is a party in judicial proceeding concerning applications for restitution and offsetting of tax credits for the corporate tax returns for 1997 to 2000, and overpayments shown in the corresponding tax receipts and tax returns filed. On December 31, 2013, the amount involved in this judicial proceeding was approximately R$363.1 million, and we have assessed the chances of loss as possible. Contractual Claims Cemig Distribuition is a party in judicial proceedings concerning economic and financial rebalancing of some construction agreements related to the Programa Nacional de Universalização do Acesso e Uso de Energia Elétrica  Luz para Todos. On December 31, 2013, the amount involved in this judicial proceeding was approximately R$ 155.2 million, and we have assessed the chances of loss as possible. 108 Table of Contents (iii) Labor Obligations CEMIG, Cemig Generation and Transmission and Cemig Distribution are defendants in several claims filed by employees and outsourced workers. Most of these claims relate to overtime and compensation for occupational hazards. In addition to these actions, there are others relating to outsourcing of labor, readjustment of retirement pension payments by Forluz, and salary adjustments. Under Brazilian employment laws, claimants must file any claim for unpaid services within two years after the termination of the contract (limited to rights which arose no more than five years prior to the claim). On December 31, 2013, proceedings where we assessed the chances of loss as probable totaled, approximately, R$146.2 million, and proceedings where we assessed the chances of loss as possible totaled, approximately, R$330.4 million. In June 2007 a judgment was rendered against Cemig in a public civil action, brought by the Public Attorneys Office for Employment Matters in early 2003, to prevent the Company from using outsourced labor for its end-activities. The judgment ordered the payment of moral damages and collective fines in the amount of R$ 0.3 million and gave the Company nine months to cease to contract employees through outsourced companies as intermediaries. In March 2008 the Higher Appeals Court gave an interim decision suspending the effects of the previous judgment until a final decision had been given. In October 2012, Higher Appeals Court reversed the judgment and the judgment of the Regional Labor Court absolving Cemig from paying moral damages and collective fines fixed. However, In November 2013, Higher Appeals Court, in a motion filed by the Public Ministry of Labor, has revised its decision and ordered the payment of moral damages and collective fines in the amount of R$ 0.15 million.Since the issue involves interpretation on the constitutionality of an article of the Concessions Law (Law 8987/95) there is a possibility of reversal of the decision in the Higher Appeals Courts Employment Issies Session (Seção de Dissídios Individuais), as well as in the Federal Supreme Court (STF). On December 31, 2013, the amount involved in this action, in the event we do not comply with the order for specific performance, moral damages and fees was, approximately, R$59 million and we have assessed the chances of loss as possible. It should be added that the amount stated considers the moral damages of R$ 0.15 million, and the total amount will only be payable only upon reversal of the decision and if the Company does not comply with the order to replace outsourced labor within the specified period, of nine months. We believe it is unlikely that any payment obligations will be imposed. (iv) Environmental Matters CEMIG, Cemig Generation and Transmission, Southern Electric and FEAM are defendants in a public civil action filed on February 5, 2007 by the Regional Environmental Association of Patrocínio, which involves a claim for indemnifying and redressing environmental damages caused by the Nova Ponte Hydroelectric Power Plant. We have presented a defense and are awaiting judgement. As of December 31, 2013, the amount involved in this action was R$1.8 billion, and we assessed the chance of loss as possible. The Minas Gerais Public Attorney filed class actions against CEMIG and Cemig Generation and Transmission seeking an order against the companies to invest at least 0.5% of its total operational revenue per year from 1997 onward, on the protection and environmental preservation of the water tables of the municipalities in which our generation plants are located and indemnify the State of Minas Gerais proportionaly for the environmental damage caused as a result of Cemigs failure to comply with the law of the State of Minas Gerais No. 12.503/97. In four of these actions, judgment was granted partly in favor of the Public Attorneys Office of Minas Gerais, in the lower courts, with CEMIG and Cemig Generation and Transmission being ordered to invest 0.5% per year of the gross operational revenue since 1997 on measures for environmental preservation and protection of the water tables in Ouro Preto, Uberaba, Água Comprida, Campo Florido, Delta, Veríssimo, Ponte Nova and Araxá. We have filed an appeal with the STJ and the STF, since the actions involve Federal Law and constitutional matters. On December 31, 2013, the amount involved in these seven actions was R$107.7 million, and we assessed the chance of loss as possible. Additionally, CEMIG, Cemig Generation and Transmission and Cemig Distribuition are party to another number of administrative and judicial proceedings and claims involving environmental matters, regarding certain protected areas, environmental licenses and remediation of environmental damages, among others. On December 31, 2013, the amount involved in these proceedings where we assessed the chance of loss as probable totaled, approximately, R$1.2 million, and where we assessed the chance of loss as possible (i.e. on the date of the financial statements an obligation was assessed as being more unlikely than likely) totaled, approximately, R$4 million. These proceedings also include several other public civil actions in which the amounts involved cannot be precisely assessed, in our view, most of these lawsuits are related to alleged environmental damages and require indemnity, remediation of damaged areas and compensation measures that will be defined in the course of the proceedings, by expertise verification of the values involved. Also, since public civil actions relate to collective rights, individual actions may be filed seeking reparations or damages arising from judicial decisions to be issued under the these civil suits. Property and liability CEMIG, Cemig Generation and Transmission and Cemig Distribution are party in several administrative and judicial proceedings and claims, mainly as a defendant, relating to real property and indemnification due to accidents taking place in the ordinary course of the business. On December 31, 2013, proceedings where we assessed the chances of loss as probable (i.e. for which on the date of the financial statements an obligation were assessed as being more likely than not) totaled, approximately, 109 Table of Contents R$26.7 million, and proceedings where we assessed the chances of loss as possible (i.e. on the date of the financial statements an obligation was assessed as being more unlikely than likely) totaled, approximately, R$122.7 million. Additionally, Cemig Distribution is a defendant in fourteen legal actions in which the plaintiffs seek indemnity for pain and suffering and property damages related to the accident that took place on February 27, 2011, in the town of Bandeira do Sul, which resulted from coiled metal carnival decorations being thrown over electricity distribution cables, causing a short-circuit which severed medium-voltage cables and resulted, when the cables hit the ground, in the death of 16 people, with dozens of other people injured. Two legal actions filed involve 29 family members of 14 of the people who died and 2 that were injuried. In spite of the fact that the accident did not arise from any action or position taken by the Company, on December 31, 2013, we have assessed the chances of loss in two of the actions as probable (i.e. for which on the date of the financial statements an obligation were assessed as being more likely than not) and the amount involved totaled, approximately, R$5.8 million. On December 31, 2013, the amount involved in the twelve other actions was approximately R$3.6 million, and we have assessed the chances of loss as possible (i.e. on the date of the financial statements an obligation was assessed as being more unlikely than likely). The greater significance of these actions for CEMIG is not related to their financial impacts, but to the negative exposure of the Companys image, since the accident was widely publicized by the media. Consumer claims Cemig Distribution is a defendant in several administrative and judicial proceedings, on subjects related to the provision of electricity distribution service in actions brought by consumers, by the Federal Public Attorneys Office and by other consumer defense bodies, with claims varying from finding of irregularities in electricity consumption metering to disconnection for lack of payment of bills, to arrangements to pay bills by installment, indemnity for pain and suffering and property damages due to accidental disconnections, indemnity for material damages arising from burning domestic electrical appliances and others. On December 31, 2013, the amount involved in these proceedings where we assessed the chance of loss as probable (i.e. for which on the date of the financial statements an obligation were assessed as being more likely than not) totaled, approximately, R$27.7 million, and where we assessed the chances of loss as possible (i.e. on the date of the financial statements an obligation was assessed as being more unlikely than likely) totaled, approximately, R$31.2 million. Dividend Policy and Payments Obligatory DividendPriority and Amount of Dividends Under our by-laws, we are required to pay to our shareholders, as obligatory dividends, 50% of the net income of each fiscal year ending December 31, determined in accordance with IFRS, Our preferred shares have priority in the allocation of the obligatory dividend for the period in question, The order of priority of the dividends distribution is as follows: · The annual minimum dividend for the preferred shares: These have preference in the event of reimbursement of shares, and have an annual minimum dividend equal to the greater of the following: · 10% of their par value; or · 3% of the shareholders equity associated with it, · The dividends on the common shares, up to the minimum percentage for the preferred shares. If a portion of the obligatory dividend remains after the payment of the common dividend, the remaining funds are to be distributed on an equal, pro rata basis with respect to all preferred shares and common shares. Without prejudice to the obligatory dividend, beginning in fiscal year 2005, every two years, or shorter period if the Companys cash position permits, we will distribute extraordinary dividends, up to the limit of the cash available, as determined by the Board of Directors, under the Companys Strategic Guidelines Plan and the dividend policy specified in that plan. The annual dividends declared shall be paid in two equal installments, the first by June 30 and the second by December 30 of each year. The extraordinary dividends shall be paid as decided by the Board of Directors. Under the Brazilian Corporate Law, the Board of Directors may declare interim dividends, in the form of interest on capital, to be paid from retained earnings, income reserves or income reported in semi-annual or quarterly financial statements. Any interim dividend paid may be set off against the amount of the obligatory dividend payable for the fiscal year in which the interim dividend was paid. 110 Table of Contents In the fiscal years in which we do not have sufficient income to pay dividends to our preferred and common shareholders, the State of Minas Gerais guarantees a minimum dividend of 6% of the par value of the preferred or common shares, respectively, per year to all shares of the Company issued up to August 5, 2004 and held by individuals. Amounts Available for Distribution The amount available for distribution is calculated on the basis of the financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting practices adopted in Brazil and the procedures described below. The obligatory dividend is calculated on the basis of adjusted net income, defined as net income after addition or subtraction of: (a) amounts allocated to the legal reserve, (b) amounts allocated to the formation of the contingency reserves and reversal of these reserves formed in previous fiscal years, and (c) any unrealized income transferred to the unrealized income reserve account, and any amounts previously posted to this reserve account which have been realized in the fiscal year and used to offset losses. We are obliged to maintain a legal reserve, to which 5% of the net income of each fiscal year that wont to 20% of the Companys social capital. However, we are not obliged to make any allocation to the legal reserve in relation to any fiscal year in which the sum of the legal reserve and the other established capital reserves exceeds 30% of the Companys total paid-in capital. Any net losses may be charged against the legal reserve. Under the Brazilian Corporate Law, income in subsidiaries or affiliated companies reported by the equity method, and income on term sales, realizable after the end of the next fiscal year, are also considered to be unrealized income. The total of income reserves (with the exception of the reserve for contingencies relating to expected losses and the unrealized income reserve), the legal reserve, the special reserves, the reserve for investment projects, and retained earnings may not be greater than the Companys registered capital. The amount in excess of our registered capital must be used to increase our registered capital or be distributed as cash dividends. Under the Brazilian Corporate Law and our by-laws, dividends not claimed within three years from the date on which they are distributed revert to us. Interest on Capital Under Brazilian law we may pay interest on capital as an alternative for the distribution of dividends to shareholders, Funds distributed as interest on equity qualify within the calculation of minimum dividend established in the by-laws. These amounts may be paid in cash; and the Company may treat them as an expense for purposes of the calculation of the income tax and social contribution, The total amount paid in interest on capital is limited to the result of application to the Companys shareholders equity of the Long Term Interest Rate (TJLP), published by BNDES and may not exceed the greater of (i) 50% of the net income (before taxes for social contribution on net profits, income tax, and the deduction of the interest attributable to shareholders equity) for the period in respect of which the payment is made or (ii) 50% of retained earnings as of the date of the beginning of the period in respect of which the payment is made. Shareholders who are not resident in Brazil must register with the Brazilian Central Bank so that the foreign currency proceeds of their dividend, interest on equity payments, or of sale or other amounts relating to their shares, may be remitted to them outside Brazil. The preferred shares underlying our Preferred ADSs and the common shares underlying our Common ADSs are held in Brazil by the custodian bank, as agent for the depositary bank, which is the registered owner of the shares. Currency Exchange Payments of cash dividends and distributions, if any, will be made in reais to the custodian on behalf of the depositary bank, which will then convert such proceeds into U.S. dollars and will cause such U.S. dollars to be delivered to the depositary bank for distribution to holders of ADRs. In the event that the custodian is unable to immediately convert the reais received as dividends into U.S. dollars, the amount of U.S. dollars payable to holders of ADRs may be adversely affected by devaluations of the real that occur before such dividends are converted and remitted. The real depreciated approximately 15,3% relative to the U.S. dollar in 2013, See Item 3, Key InformationRisk FactorsRisks Relating to Brazil The Federal Government exercises significant influence on the Brazilian economy, Political and economic conditions can have a direct impact on our business, Dividends in respect of the preferred shares and common shares paid to holders who are not Brazilian residents, including holders of Preferred ADSs and Common ADSs, are generally not subject to Brazilian withholding tax, although in general payments of interest on capital are subject to withholding tax. See Item 10, Additional InformationTaxationBrazilian Tax ConsiderationsTaxation of Dividends and U.S. Tax ConsiderationsTaxation of Distributions. There is no specific record date upon which the depositary bank will determine the exchange rate to be used in connection with converting cash dividends or 111 Table of Contents other cash distributions. Pursuant to the Deposit Agreements, the depositary bank will arrange for the funds to be converted into U.S. dollars upon receipt of notice of cash dividends or other cash distributions. History of Dividend Payments The table below gives the history of recent declarations of dividends and Interest on Equity to holders of our common and preferred shares. In each case the payment takes place in the year following the year for the results of which the dividend was declared. For the periods indicated, the dividends paid per common share and per preferred share are the same. Please see the section Item 3  Material information  Selected Consolidated Financial Information.

The payment was made on January 15, 2014. On February 14, 2014, payment of interest for the First, Second and Third Series of the Third Debenture Issue was approved, in the amount of R$ 106,418. This payment was made on February 17, 2014. On February 14, the Executive Board of Cemig D approved payment of interest on the First, Second and Third Series of the Companys Third Issue, in the amount of R$ 128,798, to holders of debentures in circulation. This payment was made on February 17, 2014. On April 4, 2014 Cemig D extended part of its debt via renewal of loan transactions totaling R$ 200 million, contracted with Banco do Brasil. The maturity date of April 4, 2014 was extended to April 4, 2015. The interest on the loan is 108.5% of the CDI Rate, p.a. On April 8, 2014 Cemig D made its seventh issue of commercial promissory notes in the domestic market, for a total of R$ 1.210 billion, paying remuneration of 105.0% of the CDI Rate, p.a., with maturity on April 3, 2015. The proceeds were used for payment of debt, and for capital investment expenditure on works to expand, renew and improve the Companys electricity distribution structure. The notes are guaranteed by Cemig. b) Cemig and the EPM group form a consortium to participate in the process of sale of the Colombian electricity utility Isagén On March 7, 2014, Cemig informed the market of the formation of a consortium with the Colombian utility company 112 Table of Contents Empresas Públicas de Medellín (EPM), to take part in the process of privatization of the company Isagén. c) Increase of Cemigs interest in Madeira Energia On March 11, 2014, the investment fund Fundo de Investimento em Participações Melbourne  FIP Melbourne  in which Cemig Geração e Transmissão S.A. (Cemig GT) is a unit holder, as Purchaser, represented by Banco Modal S.A., signed a share purchase agreement with Andrade Gutierrez Participações S.A. (AGP), as Vendor, governing the purchase, subject to certain conditions, of 83% (eighty three per cent) of the total share capital and 49% (forty nine per cent) of the voting shares in SAAG Investimentos S.A. (SAAG). By the completion date of the transaction (the Closing Date), SAAG will own 12.4% of Madeira Energia S.A. (Mesa). The transaction was the subject of a decision by the Board of Directors of Cemig GT on March 6, 2014. The acquisition will be structured through Equity Investment Funds (FIPs), and other vehicles, in which Cemig GT will have minority stockholdings. Thus Cemig will not have more than 50% of the voting stock in any vehicle, and no more than 50% of the net asset value of any of the FIPs, thus preserving the private-sector nature of the structure. The price of this acquisition will be R$ 835,385, which will undergo monetary adjustment by the IPCA (Índice Nacional de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo, or Amplified National Consumer Price) inflation Index from December 31, 2013 up to the Closing Date, augmented by any capital injections by AGP in SAAG up to the Closing Date less any dividends declared by SAAG to AGP up to the Closing Date. Conclusion of the transaction is subject to other conditions precedent, including approvals by the Brazilian monopolies authority, Cade (Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica, or Cade) and the Brazilian electricity regulator, Aneel. d) Decree Nº 8203/14  Receipt of funding from Energy Development Account (CDE) On March 7, 2014 the federal government issued Decree Nº 8203/14, which alters Decree Nº 7891/13, to include neutralization of the involuntary exposure of the distribution concession holders to the spot market, extending the principle of passthrough of funds from the Energy Development Account (Conta de Desenvolvimento Energético, or CDE) into the coverage period of January 2014. The amount of the funding from the CDE to be reimbursed to the subsidiary Cemig D, according to Aneel Dispatch Nº 515/14, relating to the electricity purchased in January 2014, is R$ 91.338 million. e) Result of the 2014 Tariff Adjustment of Cemig D (Distribution) On Monday, April 7, 2014 the Brazilian electricity regulator, Aneel (Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica, or National Electricity Agency) published the Annual Tariff Adjustment (Índice de Reajuste Tarifário, or IRT) to be applied to the tariffs charged to consumers for supply of electricity by Cemigs wholly-owned Distribution subsidiary Cemig Distribuição S.A. (Cemig D). The new rates increased the amount charged to the consumer for supply of electricity by an average of 16.33%, as from April 8, 2014. The considerable scale of the adjustment mainly arises from expenditures on purchase of electricity for resale, due to the adverse hydrological conditions which caused major use of Brazils thermal generation plants. The 2014 annual tariff adjustment involved an administrative appeal judged by Aneel regarding 2013 tariff revision process, which approved and increment the value considered for asset base, market distributed, migration of customers and other financial items.

The shares price and ADSs price were adjusted to the new number of shares, after the stock dividend. Since July 12, 2002, our shares have been traded on the LATIBEX, under the ticker symbol XCMIG, The LATIBEX is an electronic trading market created in 1999 by the Madrid Stock Exchange in order to facilitate the trading market of Latin American Securities in Euros. Trading on the BM&Bovespa The preferred shares and common shares are traded on the BM&FBovespa, the only Brazilian stock exchange that trades shares. Trading on the BM&FBovespa is limited to brokerage firms and a limited number of authorized entities. The CVM and BM&FBovespa have discretionary authority to suspend trading in shares of a particular issuer under certain circumstances. If you were to trade in the preferred shares or common shares on the BM&FBovespa, your trade would settle in three business days after the trade date. Delivery of and payment for shares is made through the facilities of a separate clearinghouse, which maintains accounts for brokerage firms. The seller is ordinarily required to deliver the shares to the exchange on the second business day following the trade date. The clearinghouse for the BM&FBovespa is Companhia Brasileira de Liquidação e Custódia (CBLC). In order to better control volatility, the BM&FBovespa has adopted a circuit breaker system pursuant to which trading sessions may be suspended (i) for a period of 30 minutes whenever the index of this stock exchange falls more than 10% from the index registered for the previous day; (ii) for one hour if the index of this stock exchange falls 15% or more from the index registered for the previous day, after the reopening of trading; and (iii) for a certain period of time to be defined by the BM&FBovespa, if the index of this stock exchange falls 20% or more from the index registered for the previous day, after the reopening of trading. The BM&FBovespa is less liquid than the NYSE and other major exchanges in the world. As of December 31, 2013, the aggregate market capitalization of the 454 companies listed on the BM&FBovespa was equivalent to approximately R$2.50 trillion and the 10 largest companies listed on the BM&FBovespa represented approximately 50% of the total market capitalization of all listed companies. Although any of the outstanding shares of a listed company may be traded on a Brazilian stock exchange, in most cases fewer than half of the listed shares are actually available for trading by the public. The remainder of these shares is held by small groups of controlling persons, governmental entities or one principal shareholder. Our preferred shares and common shares have daily liquidity on the BM&FBovespa and have had no suspension of trading in the past five years other than due to BM&FBovespa utilizing circuit breakers on a few occasions in 2008 with respect to the trading of all shares on the BM&FBovespa. We have been a member of Special Corporate Governance Level 1 of the BM&FBovespa since October 2001. The rules regarding such corporate governance segment are comprised by the Special Corporate Governance Level 1 Regulations (Regulamento do Nível 1 de Governança Corporativa), which were amended on March 21, 2011 by BM&FBovespa and approved by the CVM. Such revised set of rules became effective on May 10, 2011. Among the obligations that are contemplated by such regulations, we are required to: · present our consolidated statements of financial position, Standardized Financial Statements- DFP, consolidated income statement, quarterly financial statements  ITR, and the Reference Form (Formulário de Referência); 115 Table of Contents · include, in the notes to our quaterly financial statements, a note regarding related party transactions, containing the disclosure provided in the applicable accounting rules to annual financial statements; · disclose in the Reference Form, any direct or indirect ownership interest per type and class exceeding 5% of each type and class of the Companys capital stock, to the level of individual shareholders, once the Company has been provided with such information; · disclose the amount of free float shares and their respective percentage in relation to total shares outstanding, which shall be of at least 25% of shares representing our capital stock; · disclose, by December 10th of each year, an annual timetable of corporate events, containing, at a minimum, the date of (a) acts and corporate events, (b) public meetings with analysts and other applicable parties, and (c) disclosure of financial information scheduled for the next fiscal year, Any changes in scheduled events must be informed to the BM&FBovespa and to the public at least 5 days in advance; · hold at least one annual meeting with market analysts and any other applicable parties; · prepare, disclose and submit to the BM&FBovespa, a securities trading policy and a code of conduct establishing the values and principles that guide the Company; · establish that the term of office of our board of directors shall not exceed two years, with reelection being permitted; · have different persons occupying the positions of chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer or main executive officer of our company; and · adopt mechanisms that provide for capital dispersion in any public share offerings; · include in our by-laws the mandatory provisions required by the BM&FBovespa by May 10, 2014 (which we have already complied with); Disclosure of Trading by Insiders Brazilian securities regulations require our controlling shareholders, management, members of our Fiscal Council and any other technical or advisory body to disclose to us, the CVM and the BM&FBovespa the number and types of securities issued by us, our subsidiaries and our controlling companies that are held by them or by persons closely related to them and any changes in their respective ownership positions during the preceding 12 months, The information regarding the trading of such securities (amount, price and date of acquisition) must be provided to the CVM and the BM&FBovespa by the Company within 10 days of the end of the month in which they have occurred or of the month in which the managers of the Company were empowered. Disclosure of Material Developments Under the Brazilian securities legislation, we are required to publicize any material act or fact related to our business, to the Brazilian Securities Commission (CVM) and to BM&FBovespa (the São Paulo Stock Exchange). We are also required to publish an announcement of such material acts or facts. An act or fact is considered material if it has a material impact on: the price of our securities; the decision of investors to buy, sell or hold our securities; or the decision of investors to exercise any rights as holder of any of our securities. Under extraordinary circumstances, material acts or facts may in practice not be disclosed if the controlling stockholders or the management believes that revealing them would put the Companys legitimate interests at risk. Trading on Brazilian stock exchanges by persons non-resident in Brazil is subject to limitations under the Brazilian law on foreign investment. See the section Item 10. Additional information  Foreign exchange controls. Regulation of Brazilian Securities Markets The Brazilian securities markets are principally governed by Law No 6,385, dated December 7, 1976, and the Brazilian Corporate Law, each as amended and supplemented, and by regulations issued by the CVM, the CMN, and the Central Bank, which has, among other powers, licensing authority over brokerage firms, and which regulates foreign investments and foreign exchange transactions. 116 Table of Contents Under the Brazilian Corporate Law, a corporation is either publicly owned, such as we are, or closely held (companhia fechada). All publicly owned companies, including us, are registered with the CVM and are subject to reporting requirements. Our shares are traded on the BM&FBovespa, but may be traded privately subject to certain limitations. The Brazilian OTC market consists of direct trades and trades between individuals in which a financial institution registered with the CVM serves as intermediary. We have the option to ask that trading in our securities on the BM&FBovespa be suspended in anticipation of a material announcement. Trading may also be suspended on the initiative of the BM&FBovespa or the CVM based on or due to, among other reasons, a belief that a company has provided inadequate information regarding a material event or has provided inadequate responses to inquiries by the CVM or the stock exchange. Brazilian law provides general restrictions on unfair trading practices and market manipulation, although in Brazil there may be fewer instances of enforcement actions and judicial precedent is less well defined than in certain other countries. Trading on the BM&FBovespa by non-residents of Brazil is subject to limitations under Brazilian foreign investment and tax legislation. The Brazilian custodian for the preferred shares or the common shares must obtain registration from the Central Bank of Brazil to be eligible to remit for the remittance of funds U.S. dollars abroad for payments of dividends, any other cash disbursements, or upon the disposition of the shares and sales proceeds thereof. In the event that a holder of Preferred ADSs exchanges its Preferred ADSs for preferred shares or a holder of Common ADSs exchanges its Common ADSs for common shares, the holder will be entitled to continue to rely on the depositary banks certificate of registration for five business days after the exchange. Thereafter, the holder may not be able to obtain and remit U.S. dollars abroad upon the disposition of the preferred shares or common shares, or distributions relating to the preferred shares or common shares, unless the holder qualifies for and obtains a new certificate of registration. See Item 10. Additional InformationExchange Controls. Item 10. Additional Information Memorandum and Articles of Association By-laws We are a state-controlled company registered under the laws of Brazil. The registration number given to us by the Board of Trade of Minas Gerais (Junta Comercial do Estado de Minas Gerais) is 31300040127. Set forth below is a brief summary of certain significant provisions of (i) our by-laws, as amended by our general and special shareholders meeting on December 26, 2013 and (ii) Brazilian Corporate Law. The description of our by-laws contained herein does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to our by-laws, which have been filed as an exhibit to this annual report. Objects and purpose As described in Clause 1 of its by-laws, Cemig was incorporated with four main objects: (i) to build, operate and commercially operate systems of generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity, and related services; (ii) to operate in the various fields of energy, from whatever source, with a view to economic and commercial operation; (iii) to provide consultancy services within its field of operation to companies in and outside Brazil; and (iv) to carry out activities directly or indirectly related to its objects, including the development and commercial operation of telecommunication and information systems. Preferred Shares Holders of preferred shares have the right to receive annual minimum dividends in an amount equal to the greater of 10% of the par value of each preferred share or 3% of the net worth value associated with each preferred share. Holders of our preferred shares also will have priority over any other class of shares if we decide to redeem shares. A preferred share does not entitle its owner to vote at the general shareholders meetings. 117 Table of Contents Share Subscription Shares purchased by the State Government, which must constitute at all times the majority of our voting shares, are paid for in accordance with the Brazilian Corporate Law. Shares purchased by other shareholders (whether natural persons or companies) shall be paid for in accordance with the decision resulting from the general meeting of shareholders that addresses the matter. Article 171 of the Brazilian Corporate Law provides that each shareholder has a general preemptive right to subscribe for new shares or convertible securities issued in any capital increase, in proportion to that shareholders shareholding, except in the event of the exercise of any option to acquire shares of our capital stock. Shareholders must exercise their preemptive rights within 30 days after the publication of the notice of capital increase. In the event of a capital increase, holders of Preferred ADSs, which represent preferred shares, and holders of Common ADSs, which represent common shares, would have preemptive rights to subscribe only to newly issued preferred shares or common shares, as the case may be, in proportion to their shareholdings but may not be able to exercise these rights because of U.S. securities law limitations. See Item 3, Risk FactorsRisks Relating to the Preferred Shares, Preferred ADSs, Common shares and Common ADSsYou may not be able to exercise preemptive rights with respect to our securities. Non-controlling Shareholders Our by-laws provide that the preferred and minority common shareholders are entitled to elect one member and an alternate to the Board of Directors, respectively, in a separate voting, as more fully described in Rights of ShareholdersRights of Minority Shareholders. Dividends For a discussion of our dividend policy, see Item 8, Financial InformationDividend Policy and Payments. General Meetings of Stockholders General Meetings of Stockholders are held for the purposes specified in law, as stated in the Brazilian Corporate Law. Ordinary General Meetings are held within the first four months of the business year, and must be called with 15 days prior notice. The Brazilian Corporate Law also specifies that the following actions may be taken only at a General Meeting of Stockholders: · any change in the by-laws; · increase or reduction in the Companys issued share capital, and subscription of new shares; · election and/or dismissal of members of the Board of Directors or of the Fiscal Council; · authorization for issue of convertible debentures or any other convertible securities; · suspension of exercise of the rights of a stockholder who has violated Brazilian Corporation Law or the by-laws; · approval of any merger with or absorption of or by another company in which we are not the surviving company or the spin-off; · acceptance or rejection of the valuation of in-kind contributions offered by a stockholder in consideration for issuance of shares; · approval of transformation of the Company into a limited liability company or into any other form of corporate entity; · approval of any dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the appointment or dismissal of the respective liquidator and/or review of the reports prepared by him or her; · any action relating to bankruptcy or concordata; · approval of the financial statements on an annual basis; · issuance of founders shares; or 118 Table of Contents · cancellation of registry with the CVM as a publicly-held company or delisting of our common shares from the BM&FBovespa, except in the case of a public tender offer for privatization. As a general rule, the affirmative vote of stockholders representing at least the majority of our issued common shares in circulation, present in person or represented by proxy at a General Meeting of Stockholders, is required to approve or ratify any proposed measure. Abstentions are not taken into account. However, the affirmative vote of stockholders representing one half of our issued shares in circulation is required, for any decision to: · create preferred shares or disproportionately increase an existing class of preferred shares in relation to the other classes of shares, unless such action is provided for in, or authorized by, our by-laws; · modify a preference, privilege or condition in terms of redemption or amortization conferred on one or more classes of preferred shares; or create a new class with greater privileges than those of the existing classes of preferred shares; · reduce the percentage of mandatory dividends; · make any change to the Companys corporate objects; · cause the Company to absorb or to be absorbed by, or to merge with, another company; · spin off a portion of our assets or liabilities; · approve our participation in a group of companies; · apply for cancellation of liquidation status; · approve dissolution of the Company; · approve the creation of founders shares; and/or · approve the absorption of all of our shares by another company in such a way that we become a wholly-owned subsidiary of that other company. Stockholders may be represented at a stockholders meeting by a person holding power of attorney from the stockholder, appointed no more than one year prior to the meeting. To be eligible to represent a stockholder in a General Meeting of Stockholders, the person holding power of attorney must be a stockholder, or one of our executive officers or one of the members of the Board of Directors, or an attorney-at-law. In a publicly held corporation, such as ours, the party holding the Power of Attorney may also be a financial institution. Subject to the provisions of the Brazilian Corporate Law and our by-laws, our Board of Directors may ordinarily call our General Meetings of Stockholders.

Under Brazilian Corporate Law, members of the Board of Directors of a company usually have certain duties equivalent to those imposed by the laws of the majority of the States of the USA, including duty of loyalty to the company, duty not to trade in their own personal interest, and the duty to pay proper attention in the management of the companys business. The Members of our Board of Directors and our Executive Board may be held liable for failure in these duties to us and to our stockholders, and may be subject to legal action in proceedings brought by government bodies or by our stockholders. There are no provisions in our bylaws relating to: (i) power for a board member to vote on proposals or contracts in which he or she has a material interest; (ii) powers that may be exercised by our board members to take on loans; (iii) retirement age for members of the Board of Directors; or (iv) the number of shares necessary for qualification of board members. The Chair and Vice-Chair of the Board of Directors must be chosen by their peers, at the first meeting of the Board of Directors that takes place after the election of its members, and the Vice-Chair shall take the place of the Chair when the Chair is absent or impeded from exercising his/her functions. It is the competency of our stockholders to set the remuneration of the members of boards at the General Meeting of Stockholders at which the board members are elected Rights of Shareholders We extend to our shareholders all of the rights that are provided under Brazilian law, Our by-laws are in compliance with the Brazilian Corporate Law. Essential Rights Article 109 of the Brazilian Corporate Law provides that a corporation may not deny certain rights to its shareholders under any circumstances, These shareholders rights include: · the right to have a share of the corporations earnings; · the right to have a share of the corporations assets, in the event of liquidation thereof; · the right to supervise our management according to the Brazilian Corporate Law; · preemptive rights to subscribe new shares or securities convertible into shares, except for exceptions provided by the Brazilian Corporate Law and our by-laws; and · the right to withdraw from the company under certain circumstances provided in the Brazilian Corporate Law, Voting Rights As a general rule, only our common shares are entitled to vote and each common share corresponds to one vote. Holders of preferred shares acquire voting rights if, during three consecutive fiscal years, we fail to pay a fixed or minimum dividend to which the preferred shares are entitled. If a holder of preferred shares acquires voting rights in this manner, such rights will be identical to the voting rights of a holder of common shares and will continue until the dividend is paid. No restrictions exist on the right of a holder of common shares or preferred shares to exercise voting rights with respect to such shares by virtue of such holder being a non-resident of Brazil or a citizen of a country other than Brazil. However, holders of Preferred ADSs may only vote the underlying preferred 121 Table of Contents shares through the depositary according to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement, and holders of Common ADSs may only vote the underlying common shares through the depositary according to the terms of the Common ADS Deposit Agreement. In any circumstance in which holders of preferred shares are entitled to vote, each preferred share will entitle its holder to one vote. Redemption Rights Our common shares and preferred shares are not redeemable, with the exception that a dissenting stockholder is entitled under Brazilian Corporate Law to obtain redemption in the event of any of the following decisions being made at a stockholders meeting by stockholders representing at least 50% of the voting shares: · to create a new class of preferred shares or to disproportionately increase an existing class of preferred shares relative to the other classes of share (unless such actions are provided for or authorized by the by-laws); · to modify a preference, privilege or condition of redemption or amortization conferred on one or more classes of preferred shares, or to create a new class with greater privileges than the existing classes of preferred shares; · to reduce the mandatory distribution of dividends; · to change the Companys corporate objects; · to have the Company be absorbed by another company or merged; · to transfer all of our shares to another company in such a way as to make us a wholly-owned subsidiary of that company; · to approve acquisition of the control of another company at a price that exceeds certain limits set out in the Brazilian Corporate Law; · to carry out a split of the Company; · to transform the Company into another type of company; · to approve the Companys participation in a group of companies as defined in the Brazilian Corporate Law; · or in the event that an entity resulting from (a) an absorption, (b) transfer of shares as described in item (6) above or (c) a split made by the Company fails to become a listed company within 120 calendar days from the meeting at which such decision was taken. Only holders of shares adversely affected by the changes mentioned in items (1) and (2) above may require the Company to redeem their shares. The right of redemption mentioned in items (5), (6) (7) and (10) above may only be exercised if our shares do not satisfy certain indices of liquidity or dispersion at the time of the decision by the stockholder. The stockholders right to withdraw referred to in item (8) may be exercised only if the split results in: (a) change in the corporate objects, except when the equity value of the assets and liabilities split off is passed to a company whose preponderant activity coincides with that arising from the corporate objects of the company from which it is split; (b) reduction of the obligatory dividend; or (c) participation in a group of companies. Also note that in the case of item (11), the right to withdraw applies to all the Companys stockholders, and not only to those who have been dissident at the related General Meeting of Stockholders. The right to redeem shares will expire 30 calendar days from publication of the minutes of the related stockholders meeting, except: (a) in the case of items (1) and (2) above, if the decision is subject to confirmation by the holders of the preferred shares (which must be given in an Extraordinary General Meeting to be held within one year), in which case the period of 30 days shall be counted from publication of the minutes of the Extraordinary General Meeting; or (b) in the case of item (11) above, in which case the period of 30 days shall be counted from the end of a period of 120 days, given for the company resulting from the absorption, merger or split to obtain a listed company registration and have its shares listed on the secondary market. Our Company will have the right to reconsider any act that gives rise to rights of redemption within 10 calendar days from expiry of such rights if the redemption of shares of dissident stockholders places the Companys financial stability at risk. Law 9457 of May 5, 1997, which altered the Brazilian Corporate Law, contains provisions which, among other matters, restrict the rights of redemption in certain cases and allow companies to redeem their shares for their economic value, subject to certain requirements. Our by-laws at present do not specify that our share capital may be redeemed at its economic value and, consequently, any redemption in accordance with the Brazilian Corporate Law would be made at a minimum of the book value per share, determined on the basis of the last Statement of financial position approved by the stockholders, it being stipulated that, if the General Meeting which gives rise to the rights of redemption has taken place more than 60 calendar days from the date of the last Statement of financial position approved, 122 Table of Contents the stockholder shall have the right to require that its shares be valued based on a new Statement of financial position on a date that falls within a period of 60 calendar days from the General Meeting of Stockholders. Rights of Non-controlling Shareholders The Brazilian Corporate Law provides that shareholders who own at least 5% of the capital stock of a corporation are afforded the following rights, among others: · the right to require that the books of the corporation be made available for review, whenever there is any indication of an act violating the Brazilian legislation or the Companys by-laws, or whenever these have been violated, or if there is a suspicion with grounds that serious irregularities have been committed by the companys management; · the right to require the Companys managers to reveal: (i) the number of securities issued by the company or by subsidiaries, or companies of the same group, that they have acquired or sold, directly or through other people, in the prior business year; (ii) the share purchase options that they have contracted or exercised in the prior business year; (iii) all benefits or advantages, whether indirect or complementary, that they have received or which they are receiving from the company, or from affiliated or subsidiary companies or companies of the same group; (iv) the terms of such employment contracts as have been signed by the company with directors or high-level employees; and/or (v) any other material acts or facts in the activities of the company. · the right to require that the members of the Fiscal Council supply information about matters within their sphere of competence; · the right to call general meetings of stockholders, in certain circumstances, whenever the members of the Board of Directors or of the Executive Board omit to do so; and · the right to file legal actions for indemnity against members of the Board of Directors or the Executive Board, as the case may be, for losses and/or damages caused to the companys property, whenever it is decided in the General Meeting of Stockholders that such an application for indemnity will not be presented. Non-controlling shareholders that own, individually or in the aggregate, our outstanding common shares (since at least 10% of our outstanding common shares are held by non-controlling shareholders), and also holders of our preferred shares, have the right to appoint one member of the Fiscal Council and an alternate. All shareholders have the right to attend general meetings of shareholders. The Brazilian Corporate Law also provides that minority shareholders that hold either (i) preferred shares representing at least 10% of the total share capital of a company or (ii) common shares representing at least 15% of the voting capital of a company, have the right to appoint one member and an alternate to the Board of Directors. If no common or preferred shareholder meets these thresholds, shareholders holding preferred shares or common shares representing at least 10% of the total share capital of the company are entitled to combine their holdings to appoint one member and an alternate to the Board of Directors. Changes in rights of stockholders A General Meeting of Stockholders must be held whenever the Company intends to change the rights of holders of our common shares or preferred shares. Under the Brazilian Corporate Law the proposed changes must be approved by a majority of the class of stockholders that would be affected. Certain changes related to the rights of preferred shares, such as changes in preferences, advantages or conditions of redemption or amortization, may result in the exercise of rights to withdraw by the holders of the shares affected. Going Private Transactions and Delisting from the BM&FBovespa Our delisting, as a public company, must be preceded by a tender offer by our controlling shareholders or ourselves for the acquisition of all our then outstanding shares, subject to the conditions below: · the price offered for the shares under the public offering must be the fair value of those shares, as established in Brazilian Corporate Law; and 123 Table of Contents · shareholders holding more than two thirds of our float shares shall have expressly agreed to our decision to become a private company or accepted the offer, Under the Brazilian Corporate Law, the fair price shall be at least equal to our valuation as determined by one or more of the following valuation methods: Stockholders equity as expressed by book value, Stockholders equity valued at market prices, discounted cash flow, comparison of multiples, the quoted price of our shares on the securities market; or based on some other method of valuation accepted by the CVM. This price of the offer may be revised if it is challenged within 15 calendar days of its publication by holders of at least 10% of our shares in circulation, by means of a request sent to our management for an extraordinary General Meeting of Stockholders to be called to decide on whether to request new valuations, using the same, or another, valuation method. If the new valuation is lower than the valuation challenged, the stockholders that requested a new valuation, and those that approved the request, shall reimburse us for the costs incurred. However, if the second valuation is higher, the offering party will have the option to continue the offer, with the new price, or withdraw the offer. Arbitration Pursuant to the Brazilian Corporate Law and related regulations, if provided for in a companys by-laws, disputes among shareholders will be subject to arbitration. Our by-laws currently do not provide for arbitration. Material Contracts For information concerning our material contracts, see 
