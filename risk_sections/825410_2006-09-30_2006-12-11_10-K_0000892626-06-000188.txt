ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward- looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. WE RELY ON A SINGLE FACILITY FOR THE MANUFACTURING AND PROCESSING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. Landauer conducts its primary manufacturing and laboratory processing operations and performs significant functions for some of its international operations from a single facility in Glenwood, Illinois. If the Company were to lose availability of its primary facility due to fire, natural disaster or other disruptions, the Company's operations could be significantly impaired. Although the Company maintains business interruption insurance, there can be no assurance that the proceeds of such insurance would be sufficient to offset any loss the Company might incur or that the Company would be able to retain its customer base if operations were so disrupted. WE RELY ON A SINGLE FACILITY FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF CRYSTAL MATERIAL, A KEY COMPONENT IN OUR OSL TECHNOLOGY, AND A SINGLE VENDOR FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF INLIGHT PRODUCTS. Crystal material is a key component in Landauer's OSL technology. The Company operates a single crystal manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma that currently supplies all OSL crystal radiation measurement material used by the Company. Although multiple sources for raw crystal material exist, there can be no assurance that the Company could secure another source to produce finished crystal materials to Landauer's specification in the event of a disruption at the Stillwater facility. The InLight dosimetry system and its components are manufactured by Matsushita Industrial Equipment Company under an exclusive agreement. If the Company were to lose availability of its Stillwater facility or materials from Matsushita due to a fire, natural disaster or other disruptions, such loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its operations. 9 IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. Landauer's technological expertise has been an important factor in its growth. The Company regularly pursues product improvements to maintain its technical position. The development and introduction of new technologies, the adaptability of OSL to new platforms and new formats, the usefulness of older technologies as well as the introduction of new technologies by the competition present various risks to the Company's business. The failure or lack of market acceptance of a new technology or the inability to respond to market requirements for new technology could adversely affect the Company's operations or reputation with customers. The cancellation of technology projects or the cessation of use of an existing technology can result in write-downs and charges to the Company's earnings. In the normal course of its business, Landauer must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately and relies on various computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems. Any failure of such equipment or systems could adversely affect the Company's operations. BECAUSE A PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, ADVERSE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Landauer conducts business in numerous international markets such as Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Canada, Australia and China. Foreign operations are subject to a number of special risks, including, among others, currency exchange rate fluctuations; disruption in relations; political and economic unrest; trade barriers; exchange controls; expropriation; and changes in laws and policies, including those governing foreign owned operations. OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS, CAUSE US TO INCUR LIABILITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Regulation, present and future, is a constant factor affecting the Company's business. The radiation monitoring industry is subject to federal, state, and international governmental regulation. Unknown matters, new laws and regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations may materially affect Landauer's business or operations in the future and/or could increase the cost of compliance. Many of the Company's technology-based services must comply with various national and international standards that are used by regulatory and accreditation bodies for approving such services and products. Changes in these standards and accreditation requirements can result in the Company having to incur costs to adapt its offerings and procedures. Such adaptations may introduce quality assurance issues during transition that need to be addressed to ensure timely and accurate analyses and data reporting. Additionally, changes affecting radiation protection practices, including new understandings of the hazards of radiation exposure and amended regulations, may impact how the Company's services are used by its customers and may, in some circumstances, cause the Company to alter its products and delivery of its services. FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS. The Company is exposed to market risk, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The financial statements of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. To date, the market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates has not been material in relation to the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. These risks could increase, however, as the Company expands in international markets. The Company does not have any significant trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, or commitments in a currency 10 other than that of the reporting unit's functional currency. As such, the Company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage the exposure in its non-U.S. operations. WE MAY FACE COMPETITORS, SEVERAL OF WHICH HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES. The Company competes on the basis of advanced technologies, competent execution of these technologies, the quality, reliability and price of its services and its prompt and responsive performance. In much of the world, radiation monitoring activities are conducted by a combination of private entities and governmental agencies. The Company's primary competitor in the United States is large and has substantial resources. The Company also faces competitive pressures from a number of smaller competitors. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS At September 30, 2006, the Company does not have any unresolved written comments from the Commission staff regarding its periodic or current reports under the Act.
