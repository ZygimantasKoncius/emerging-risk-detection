Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Risks Relating to the Company and Its Business Our business and results of operations depend on the volatile People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) domestic coal markets. Our business and operating results depend on the PRC domestic supply and demand for coal and coal products. The domestic coal markets are cyclical and have historically experienced pricing volatility, which reflects, among other factors, the conditions of the PRC and global economies and demand fluctuations in key industries that have high coal consumption. Difficult economic conditions have resulted in lower coal prices, which in turn negatively affect our operational and financial performance. The domestic and international coal markets are affected by supply and demand. The demand for coal is primarily affected by the global economy and the performance of power generation, chemical, metallurgy and construction materials industries. The availability and prices of alternative sources of energy, such as natural gas, oil, hydropower, solar and nuclear power also affect the demand for coal. The supply of coal, on the other hand, is primarily affected by the geographical location of coal reserves, the transportation capacity of coal transportation railways, the volume of domestic and international coal supplies and the type, quality and price of competitors’ coal. A significant rise in global coal supply or a reduction in coal demand may have an adverse effect on coal prices, which in turn, may reduce our profitability and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our business is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings and profitability. The coal business is highly competitive in China and we face substantial competition in connection with the marketing and sale of our products. Some of our competitors are well established, have greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources, have been in business for longer periods of time than we have, and have products that have gained wide customer acceptance in the marketplace. The greater financial resources of our competitors will permit them to implement extensive marketing and promotional programs. We could fail to expand our market share, and could fail to maintain our current share. Increased competition could also result in overcapacity in the Chinese coal industry in general. The coal industry in China has experienced overcapacity in the past. During the mid-1970s and early 1980s, a growing coal market and increased demand for coal in China attracted new investors to the coal industry, spurred the development of new mines and resulted in added production capacity throughout the industry, all of which led to increased competition and lower coal prices. Similarly, an increase in future coal prices could encourage the development of expanded capacity by new or existing coal processors. Any overcapacity could reduce coal prices in the future and our profitability would be impaired. Our results of operations depend on our ability to acquire new coal mines and other coal-related businesses. The recoverable coal reserves in mines decline as coal is extracted from them. Our ability to significantly increase our production capacity at existing mines requires that we prove additional reserves and secure approvals from the government for increased production. We will also depend on acquiring new mines. Our existing mines are the DaPuAn, SuTsong and Ping Yi Coal Mines. The coal related business in China is heavily regulated by the PRC government. The Company’s acquisition of new mines of PRC coal companies and the procurement of related licenses and permits are subject to PRC Government approval. Delays in securing or failure to secure relevant PRC Government approvals, licenses or permits, as well as any adverse change in government policies, may hinder our expansion plans, which may materially and adversely affect our profitability and growth prospects. We cannot assure you that our future expansion or investments will be successful. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or acquire these targets on competitive terms and in a timely manner. We may not be able to successfully develop new coal mines or expand our existing ones in accordance with our development plans or at all. We may also fail to acquire or develop additional coal washing and coking facilities in the future. Failure to successfully acquire suitable targets on competitive terms, develop new coal mines or expand our existing coal mines could have an adverse effect on our competitiveness and growth prospects. 6 If we fail to obtain additional financing we will be unable to execute our business plan. As we continue to grow quickly, we require capital infusions from the capital market. Under our current business strategy, our ability to grow may depend on the availability of additional funds, suitable acquisition targets at an acceptable cost, and working capital. Our ability to compete effectively, to reach agreements with acquisition targets on commercially reasonable terms, to secure critical financing and to attract professional managers is critical to our success. Despite our recent financings, we may need additional funds to make future acquisitions, continue improving our current coal mines and other coal processing facilities, and to obtain regulatory approvals for our operations. Should such needs arise, we intend to seek additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing, strategic transactions and/or from other sources. However, there are no assurances that future funding will be available on favorable terms or at all. If additional funding is not obtained, we will need to reduce, defer or cancel development programs, planned initiatives or overhead expenditures, to the extent necessary. The failure to fund our capital requirements would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the benefits of an acquisition may take considerable time to develop and we cannot assure investors that any particular acquisition or joint venture will produce the intended benefits. Moreover, the identification and completion of these transactions may require us to expend significant management time and effort and other resources. Coal reserve estimates may be materially different from reserves that we may actually recover The coal reserves disclosed for the mines from which we have the right to extract coal are the estimated quantities (based on applicable reporting regulations) that under present and anticipated conditions have the potential to be economically mined and processed. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of coal reserves and in projecting potential future rates of coal production including many factors beyond our control. In addition, reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground deposits of reserves that cannot be measured in an exact manner and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Estimates of different engineers may vary and results of our mining/drilling and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of estimates. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production experience and other factors. In addition, several factors including the market price of coal, reduced recovery rates or increased production costs due to inflation or other factors may render certain estimated proved and probable coal reserves uneconomical to exploit and may ultimately result in a restatement of reserves. This may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. Our business operations may be adversely affected by present or future environmental regulations, and coal industry standards. As a Chinese producer of coal products, we are subject to significant, extensive and increasingly stringent environmental protection laws and governmental regulations on coal standards, and safety requirements. These laws and regulations: •impose fees for the discharge of waste substances, pollutants; •require provisions for reclamation and rehabilitation; •impose fines for serious environmental offenses; and •authorize the PRC Government to close down any facility that it determines has failed to comply with environmental regulations, operating standards, and suspend any coal operations that cause excessive environmental damage. Our coal mining, washing and coking operations meet all the existing China environmental and safety standards. Most of our operations are based on traditional, old coal extraction and processing techniques, which are popular in China, and which produce waste water, gas emissions and solid waste materials. The PRC Government has tightened enforcement of applicable laws and regulations and adopted more stringent environmental standards, and operational standards. Our budgeted amount for environmental regulatory compliance may not be sufficient, and we may need to allocate additional funds for this purpose. If we fail to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations, we may be required to pay penalties or fines or take corrective actions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition. China is a signatory to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which are intended to limit greenhouse gas emissions. On March 14, 2006, the PRC Government released the outline of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development, which sets goals to decrease the amount of energy consumed per unit of GDP by 20 percent and to reduce the emission of certain major pollutants by ten percent. In addition, recent discussions between the Chinese government and U.S. government on clean energy initiatives, including the reduction of CO2 levels and the use low-carbon coal, which initiatives may be incorporated in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development, may have significant effects on our business operations. If efforts to reduce energy consumption, to use low-carbon coal, and to control greenhouse gas emissions reducing coal consumption, our revenue would decrease and our business would be adversely affected. 7 We depend on key persons and the loss of any key person could adversely affect our operations. The future success of our investments in China is dependent on our management team, including Mr. Dickson V. Lee, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Clayton Fong, our Executive Vice President of US operations, and managers who are multi-lingual, understand cultural differences, and are adept at doing business internationally. If one or more of our key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to easily replace them, and we may incur additional expenses to recruit and train new personnel. The loss of our key personnel could severely disrupt our business and its financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, since the industries we invest in are characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent, we may need to offer higher compensation and other benefits in order to attract and retain key personnel in the future. We cannot assure our investors that we will be able to attract or retain the key personnel needed to achieve our business objectives. Currently, only Mr. Lee is covered by a one-year term accident insurance policy in China, which is paid for by the Company. Although we currently do not maintain “key person” life insurance for any of its key personnel, we are in a process of obtaining a “key person” life insurance package for Mr. Lee and we expect to obtain such insurance policy in 2011. We may suffer losses resulting from industry-related accidents and lack of insurance. We operate coal mines and related facilities that may be affected by water, gas, fire or structural problems and earthquakes. As a result, we, like other companies operating coal mines, have experienced accidents that have caused property damage and personal injuries. Although the Company continuously reviews its existing operational standards, including insurance coverage, and it has implemented safety measures, fire training at our mining operations and provided on-the-job training for our employees and workers, there can be no assurance that industry-related accidents and earthquakes will not occur in the future. The insurance industry in China is still in its developmental stage and the Chinese insurance companies offer only limited business insurance products. We currently only have work-related injury insurance for our employees at the DaPuAn, SuTsong and Ping Yi Mines, and limited accident insurance for staff working in China. Any uninsured losses and liabilities incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Disruptions to the Chinese railway transportation system and the other limited modes of transportation by which we deliver our products may adversely affect our ability to sell our coal products. A substantial portion of the coal products we sell is transported to our customers by the Chinese national railway system. As the railway system has limited transportation capacity and cannot fully satisfy coal transportation requirements, discrepancies between capacity and demand for transportation exist in certain areas of the PRC. No assurance can be given that we will continue to be allocated adequate railway transport capacity or acquire adequate rail cars, or that we will not experience any material delay in transporting our coal as a result of insufficient railway transport capacity or rail cars. Some of our business operations depend on a single transportation carrier or a single mode of transportation to deliver our coal products. Disruption of any of these transportation services due to weather-related problems, flooding, drought, accidents, mechanical difficulties, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks, and other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to our customers. Our transportation providers may face difficulties in the future that may impair our ability to supply coal to our customers, resulting in decreased revenues. Our continued operations of coal mines are dependent on our ability to obtain and maintain mining licenses and other PRC government approvals for our mining operations. 8 Unlike land in the United States, much of which is owned by private individuals, the land and underlying minerals in China belongs to the Chinese government and is only leased to lessees such as the Company on a long-term basis, ranging from 40 to 70 years. Like land in China, coal reserves are owned by the Chinese government, which issues a mining license when the government leases exclusive mining rights to a mining operator on a long term basis (normally 50 years). This license allows the mining operators to operate and extract coal from the mine. Thus, coal mining licenses are the exclusive evidence for approval of a coal mines mining rights by the Chinese government. The government charges all mining operators an upfront fee plus a surcharge ranging from 2%-3% of the value of the coal excavated from the ground. The coal industry in China is heavily regulated by the government for safety and operational reasons. Several licenses and permits are required in order to operate a coal mine. These licenses and permits, once issued, are reviewed typically once a year. Our ownership structure is subject to regulatory controls, approvals and timely payments in connection with our acquisitions. Failure to obtain such approvals or to timely remit required payments may cause the unwinding of our acquisitions. On October 21, 2005, the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange ("SAFE") issued a new circular ("Circular 75"), effective November 1, 2005, which repealed Circular 11 and Circular 29, which previously required Chinese residents to seek approval from SAFE before establishing any control of a foreign company or transfer of China-based assets or equity for the shares of the foreign company. SAFE also issued a news release about the issuance of its Circular 75 to make it clear that Chinas national policies encourage the efforts by Chinese private companies and high technology companies to obtain offshore financing. Circular 75 confirmed that the uses of offshore special purpose vehicles (SPV) as holding companies for PRC investments are permitted as long as proper foreign exchange registrations are made with SAFE. As China starts to develop its legal system, additional legal, administrative, and regulatory rules and regulations may be enacted, and the Company may become subject to the additional rules and regulation applicable to the Companys Chinese subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries KMC and TNI have been registered as American subsidiaries, and all required capital contributions have been made into them. We are also in the process of registering our equity ownership interest in the DaPuAn and SuTsong Mines with the Chinese government, under the provisional name L & L Coal Partners through a nominee who is a Chinese citizen that holds our equity ownership in trust for the benefit of the Company under an agency agreement executed in April 2008. Because this equity will be held by a nominee, no SAFE approval is necessary for it. The Company believes that Circular 75 and other related Circulars or regulations may likely be further clarified by SAFE, in writing or through oral comments by officials from SAFE, or through implementation by SAFE in connection with actual transactions. However, failure by the Company to obtain the required PRC government approvals for the Companys acquisitions or failure to remit all of the required payments for acquisitions may lead to such acquisitions being deemed void or the unwinding of such acquisitions. Should this occur, we may seek to acquire the equity interest of our subsidiaries through other means, although we cannot guarantee that we will do so, nor can we guarantee that we will be successful if we do. Risks inherent to mining could increase the cost of operating our business. Our coal mining operations are subject to conditions beyond our control that can delay coal deliveries or increase the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time. These conditions include weather and natural disasters, unexpected maintenance problems, key equipment failures, variations in coal seam thickness, variations in the amount of rock and soil overlying the coal deposit, variations in rock and other natural materials and variations in geologic conditions. As with all underground coal mining companies, our operations are affected by mining conditions such as a deterioration in the quality or thickness of faults and/or coal seams, pressure in mine openings, presence of gas and/or water inflow and propensity to spontaneous combustion, as well as operational risks associated with industrial or engineering activity, such as mechanical breakdowns. Although we have conducted geological investigations to evaluate such mining conditions and adapt our mining plans to address them, there can be no assurance that the occurrence of any adverse mining conditions would not result in an increase in our costs of production, a reduction of our coal output or the temporary suspension of our operations. 9 Underground mining is also subject to certain risks such as methane outbursts and accidents caused by roof weakness and ground-falls. There can be no assurance that the occurrence of such events or conditions would not have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Risks Related to Doing Business in China Our Chinese operations pose certain risks because of the evolving state of the Chinese economy, political, and legislative and regulatory systems. Changes in the interpretations of existing laws and the enactment of new laws may negatively impact our business and results of operation. Although our principal executive office is located in Seattle, Washington, all of our current coal business operations are conducted in China. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition and prospects are subject to economic, political and legal developments in China. China’s economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including its levels of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Doing business in China involves various risks including internal and international political risks, evolving national economic policies, governmental policy on coal industry, as well as financial accounting standards, expropriation and the potential for a reversal in economic conditions. Since the late 1970s, the Chinese government has been reforming its economic system. These policies and measures may from time to time be modified or revised. While the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth in the past 20 years, growth has been uneven across different regions and among various economic sectors of China. Furthermore, while the Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of resources, some of these measures may also have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us. Also, since early 2004, the Chinese government has implemented certain measures to control the pace of economic growth including certain levels of price controls on raw coking coal. Such controls could cause our margins to be decreased. In addition, such measures may cause a decrease in the level of economic activity in China, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Adverse changes in economic policies of the Chinese government or in the laws and regulations, if any, could have a material and adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, and could adversely affect our business operations. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the application of Chinese laws, especially with respect to existing and future foreign investments in China. Despite China having its own securities laws and regulators, the Chinese legal system is in a developmental stage and has historically not enforced its Chinese securities law as rigidly as their U.S. counterparts. The interpretation and application of existing Chinese laws, regulations and policies, and the stated positions of the Chinese authorities may change and possible new laws, regulations or policies will impact our business and operations. Because of the evolving nature of the law, it will be difficult for us to manage and plan for changes that may arise. China’s judiciary is relatively inexperienced in enforcing corporate and commercial law, resulting in significant uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation in China. Consequently, there is a risk that should a dispute arise between the Company and any party with whom the Company has entered into a material agreement in China, the Company may be unable to enforce such agreements under the Chinese legal system. Chinese law will govern almost all of the Company's acquisition agreements, many of which may also require the approval of Chinese government agencies. Thus, the Company cannot assure investors that the target business will be able to enforce any of the Company’s material agreements or that remedies will be available outside China. Our business is and will continue to be subject to central, provincial, local and municipal regulation and licensing in China. Compliance with such regulations and licensing can be expected to be a time-consuming, expensive process. Compliance with foreign country laws and regulations affecting foreign investment, business operations, currency exchange, repatriation of profits, and taxation, will increase the risk of investing in our stock. We may have to incur unanticipated costs because of the unpredictability of the Chinese legal system. The Chinese legal system has many uncertainties. The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, Chinese legislation and regulations have enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system and recently-enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. In particular, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published decisions and their nonbinding nature, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. In addition, the Chinese legal system is based in part on government policies and internal 10 rules (some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all) that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. It will be difficult for any shareholder to commence a legal action against our executives. Most of our assets are located in China. Because our directors and officer(s) reside both within and outside of the United States, it may be difficult for an investor to enforce his or her rights against them or to enforce United States court judgments against them if they live outside the United States. Most of the Company's assets are located in China, outside of the United States. Additionally, the Company plans to continue acquiring other energy-related entities in China in the future. It may therefore be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon the Company or the Company's directors or officers, or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties on the Company or the Company's directors and officers under federal securit ies laws. Moreover, China currently does not have treaties with the United States or many other countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts. Our industry is heavily regulated and we may not be able to remain in compliance with all such regulations and we may be required to incur substantial costs in complying with such regulation. We are subject to extensive regulation by Chinas Mining Ministry, and by other provincial, county and local authorities in jurisdictions in which our products are processed or sold, regarding the processing, storage, and distribution of our product. Our processing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by national, province, county and local authorities. We may not be able to comply with current laws and regulations, or any future laws and regulations. To the extent that new regulations are adopted, we will be required to adjust our activities in order to comply with such regulations. We may be required to incur substantial costs in order to comply. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, rec alls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operations and finances. Changes in applicable laws and regulations may also have a negative impact on our sales. The government regulation of our operations imposes additional costs on us, and future regulations could increase those costs or limit our ability to crush, clean and process coking coal. Chinas central, provincial and local authorities regulate the coal mining industry with respect to matters such as employee health and safety, permitting and licensing requirements, air quality standards, water pollution, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed, the discharge of materials into the environment, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. We are required to prepare and present to Chinas central, provincial and local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed processing of coal may have upon the environment. The costs, liabilities and requirements associated with these regulations may be costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement, expansion or continuation of our coal processing operations. The possibility exists that new legislation and/or regulations and orders may be adopted that may materially and adversely affect our operations, our cost structure and/or our customers ability to use coal. New legislation or administrative regulations (or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations), including proposals related to the protection of the environment that would further regulate and tax the coal industry, may also require us and our customers to change operations significantly or incur increased costs. Certain sales agreements contain provisions that allow a purchaser to terminate its contract if legislation is passed that either restricts the use or type of coal permissible at the purchase rs plant or results in specified increases in the cost of coal or its use. These factors and legislation, if enacted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to currency fluctuations from our Chinese operations and fluctuations in the exchange rate may negatively affect our expenses and results of operations, as well as the value of our assets and liabilities. Effective July 21, 2005, The Peoples Bank of China announced that the Renminbi (RMB) exchange rate regime changed from a fixed rate of exchange based upon the U.S. dollar to a managed floating exchange rate regime based upon market supply and demand of a basket of currencies. On July 26, 2005, the exchange rate against the Renminbi was adjusted to 8.11 Renminbi per U.S. dollar from 8.28 Renminbi per U.S. dollar, which represents an adjustment of approximately two percent. As of January 4, 2010, Renminbi appreciated to approximately RMB 6.83 per U.S. Dollar. It is expected that the revaluation of the Renminbi and the exchange rate of the Renminbi may continue to change in the future. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Chinese RMB and the United States dollar could adversely affe ct our operating results. Results of our business operations are translated at average exchange rates into United States Dollars for purposes of reporting results. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our expenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities. Fluctuations may adversely affect the comparability of period-to-period results. We do not use hedging techniques to eliminate the effects of currency fluctuations. Thus, exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock prices. 11 Risks Related To Corporate and Stock Matters The market price for our stock may be volatile. The market price for our stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following: • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results; • changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts; • conditions in coal energy markets; • changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other coal energy companies; • announcements by us or our competitors of new products, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; • addition or departure of key personnel; • fluctuations of exchange rates between RMB and the U.S. dollar; • intellectual property litigation; and • general economic or political conditions in China. In addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock. Our corporate actions are substantially influenced by our principal stockholders and affiliated entities. Our management members and their affiliated entities own or have the beneficial ownership right to approximately 33 % of our outstanding common shares, representing approximately 33 % of our voting power. These stockholders, acting individually or as a group, could exert substantial influence over matters such as electing directors and approving mergers or other business combination transactions. In addition, because of the percentage of ownership and voting concentration in these principal stockholders and their affiliated entities, elections of our board of directors will generally be within the control of these stockholders and their affiliated entities. While all of our stockholders are entitled to vote on matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, the concentration of shares and voting control presently lies with these principal stockholders and their affiliated entities. As such, it would be difficult for stockholders to propose and have approved proposals not supported by management. There can be no assurances that matters voted upon by our officers and directors in their capacity as stockholders will be viewed favorably by all stockholders of the company. If we issue additional shares in the future, this may result in dilution to our existing stockholders. Our articles of incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of 120,000,000 shares of common stock and 2,500,000 shares of preferred stock. Our board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares up to the authorized capital stated in the articles of incorporation. Our board of directors may choose to issue some or all of such shares to acquire one or more businesses or to provide additional financing in the future. The issuance of any such shares may result in a reduction of the book value or market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we do issue any such additional shares, such issuance also will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other stockholders. Further, any such issuance may result in a change of control of our Company. The Company’s business strategy calls for strategic acquisitions of other coal-related businesses. It is anticipated that future acquisitions will require cash and issuances of our capital stock, including our common stock, warrants, preferred shares, or convertible bonds in the future. To the extent we are required to pay cash for any acquisition, we anticipate that we would be required to obtain additional equity and/or debt financing from either the public sector, or private financing. Equity financing would result in dilution for our stockholders. Stock issuances and equity financing, if obtained, may not be on terms favorable to us, and could result in dilution to our stockholders at the time(s) of these stock issuances and equity financings. 12 The authorized preferred stock constitutes what is commonly referred to as "blank check" preferred stock. This type of preferred stock allows the Board of Directors to divide the preferred stock into series, to designate each series, to fix and determine separately for each series any one or more relative rights and preferences and to issue shares of any series without further stockholder approval. Preferred stock authorized in series allows our Board of Directors to hinder or discourage an attempt to gain control of us by a merger, tender offer at a control premium price, proxy contest or otherwise. Consequently, the preferred stock could entrench our management. In addition, the market price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected by the existence of the preferred stock. Stockholders should have no expectation of any dividends. The holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefore. To date, we have not declared nor paid any cash dividends. The board of directors does not intend to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future, but instead intends to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business operations. Payment of dividends in the PRC is subject to limitations. We may not be able to pay dividends to our stockholders. We conduct all of our business through our consolidated subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC. We may rely on dividends paid by these consolidated subsidiaries for our cash needs, including funds necessary to pay any dividends and other cash distributions to our stockholders, and may serve debt we may incur and to pay our possible operating expenses. The payment of dividends by entities established in the PRC is subject to limitations. Regulations in the PRC currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with accounting standards and regulations in the PRC. Each of our PRC subsidiaries, including wholly foreign-owned enterprises and joint venture enterprises is also required to set aside certain amount of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves or statutory capital reserve fund until possible, the aggregate amount of such reserves reaches 50% of its respective registered capital. Our statutory reserves are not distributable as loans, advances or cash dividends. In addition, if any of our PRC subsidiaries incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. As of April 30, 2010, our PRC subsidiaries had not allocated to these reserves. Any limitations on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to transfer funds to us may materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business. In addition, under a new PRC tax law that became effective in January 2008 and the Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion, or the Double Taxation Arrangement, which became effective on January 1, 2007, dividends from our PRC subsidiaries paid to us through our Hong Kong subsidiary may also be subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 5%. The withholding tax on dividends may be exempted or reduced by the State Council of the PRC. Furthermore, the ultimate tax rate will be determined by treaty between the PRC and the tax residence of the holder of the PRC subsidiary. We are actively monitoring the proposed withholding tax and are evaluating appropriate organizational changes to minimize the corresponding tax impact. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. We are subject to reporting obligations under the U.S. securities laws. The SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring every public company to include a management report on such company’s internal controls over financial reporting in its Annual Report, which contains management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, beginning with our Annual Report for the year ending April 30, 2010, an independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Our management may conclude that our internal controls over our financial reporting are not effective. Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may still decline to attest to our management’s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. Our reporting obligations as a public company will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future. Effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our stock. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will incur considerable costs and use significant management time and other resources in an effort to comply with Section 404 and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We also expect these developments will make it more difficult and more expensive for the Company to attract and retain additional members to the Board of Directors (both independent and non-independent), and additional executives. 13 New governmental regulation relating to greenhouse gas emissions may subject us to significant new costs and restrictions on our operations Climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. There are bills pending in Congress that would regulate greenhouse gas emissions through a cap-and-trade system under which emitters would be required to buy allowances to offset emissions of greenhouse gas. In addition, several states are considering various greenhouse gas registration and reduction programs. Certain of our manufacturing plants use significant amounts of energy, including electricity and gas, and emit amounts of greenhouse gas are likely to be affected by existing proposals. Greenhouse gas regulation could increase the price of the electricity we purchase, increase costs for our use o f natural gas, potentially restrict access to or the use of natural gas, require us to purchase allowances to offset our own emissions or result in an overall increase in our costs of raw materials, any one of which could significantly increase our costs, reduce our competitiveness in a global economy or otherwise negatively affect our business, operations or financial results. While future emission regulation appears likely, it is too early to predict how this regulation will affect our business, operations or financial results Item 1B.
