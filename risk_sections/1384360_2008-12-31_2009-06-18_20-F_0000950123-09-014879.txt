D. Risk FactorsOur future research and development projects may not be successful. Furthermore, as the research and development cycle for innovative pharmaceuticals is long, our expenditures on current and future research and development projects are subject to many uncertainties. The cost of research and development projects may vary significantly over the life of a research and development project as a result of a variety of factors, including:  the delay in research and development of certain projects preventing us to focus our resources on more promising product candidates;  the intended use of a product candidate, which affects the length and timing of the research and development projects;  the number of patients who participate in the clinical trials;  the number of sites included in clinical trials;  the length of time required to enroll clinical trial participants;  the duration of patient treatment and follow-up during clinical trials;  the costs of producing supplies of the product candidates needed for clinical trials; and  the requirement and timing of SFDA approvals. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine with any significant degree of certainty the duration and the completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as and when incurred. These expenses include the costs of our internal research and development activities and the costs of research and development conducted by others on our behalf, such as through third-party collaboration arrangements discussed above. Upfront payments for research and development costs in connection with third party research and development collaboration arrangements prior to obtaining regulatory approval are recognized as research and development expenses as the research and development activities are performed. Refundable milestone payments made by us in advance to third parties under research and development arrangements are recorded as research and development expense when the specific milestone is achieved. Research and development costs incurred subsequent to obtaining regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of the remaining license period and the patent protection period for the product. We have incurred research and development expenses of RMB34.3 million, RMB68.3 million and RMB86.1 million ($12.6 million) in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, representing 3.6%, 4.9% and 4.9% of our total revenues, respectively. We are committed to increase our research and development capabilities, and expect to incur higher research and development expenses as we plan to supplement our development of first-to-market generic pharmaceuticals in China with increasing efforts in the research and development of innovative pharmaceuticals. We have also received government grants for certain of our projects and such grants have been recorded as a reduction of our research and development expenses as disclosed in our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we have in the past sought, and may continue to seek, to acquire rights to development stage clinical products, technologies or suitable businesses that complement our expansion strategies and our existing products and products under development. To acquire these rights, we are required to utilize significant financial 56 Table of Contents resources and incur increased in process research and development or intangibles amortization expense. Our research and development expenses also included depreciation of our new research facility after it was completed in January 2007. We expect that our total research and development expenses will increase in absolute terms in the future. Sales, Marketing and Distribution Expenses Sales, marketing and distribution expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales, marketing, distribution and customer support functions and costs associated with advertising and other marketing activities including expenses of engaging professional promotion and marketing companies. We host in-person product presentations, conference and seminars for physicians, other healthcare professionals and research scholars to promote and generate awareness of our pharmaceuticals. For our OTC pharmaceuticals, we also carry out consumer advertising and educational campaigns. As the pharmaceutical market in China continues to grow, we plan to further develop and strengthen our sales, marketing and distribution network in order to increase the market recognition of our products and our Simcere brand name. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, sales, marketing and distribution expenses increased primarily as a result of the additional sales and marketing activities carried out by an increased number of sales personnel and our increased product offerings. In the near term, we expect our total sales, marketing and distribution expenses to increase as we continue to broaden our market reach and increase revenues by introducing new branded pharmaceuticals, such as our new innovative pharmaceutical Endu, and by enhancing and strengthening the brand names and marketing efforts of our existing portfolio of pharmaceuticals. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for our administrative, finance and human resources personnel, depreciation of equipment and facilities of our administrative offices, amortization of rental facilities used for administrative purposes, bad debt expense, fees and expenses of legal, accounting and other professional services and other expenses associated with our administrative offices. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we recruit additional professionals and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business. Share-Based Compensation Expenses We adopted our 2006 share incentive plan on November 13, 2006, under which we issued to certain members of our directors, senior management and key employees on November 15, 2006 options to purchase 10.0 million ordinary shares at an exercise price of $4.20 per ordinary share. These options vest over a five-year period, with 20.0% of them vesting on November 14 of each year beginning in 2007. These options will expire on November 14, 2012. On March 29, 2007, we granted 1,045,000 options to our independent directors and certain employees with an exercise price equal to $6.75. These options vest over a five-year period, with 20.0% of them vesting on March 28 of each year beginning in 2008. On May 5, 2008, we granted 400,000 options to a senior executive officer with an exercise price equal to $6.755. These options vest over 4.85 year, with 20.0% of them vesting on March 8 of each year beginning in 2009. On December 24, 2008, we granted 100,000 options to a senior executive officer with an exercise price equal to $3.445. These options vest over 4.69 year, with 20.0% of them vesting on August 31 of each year beginning in 2009. All of the above options granted will also vest only if the option holder is still a director or an employee of our company at the time of the relevant vesting or unless otherwise approved by our compensation committee. We account for share-based compensation expenses based on the fair value of the share options on the date of the grant and recognize the amount over the requisite service period. We recognized share-based compensation in the amount of RMB3.4 million, RMB30.8 million and RMB25.5 million ($3.7 million) in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Share-based compensation expenses are allocated among each of research and development expenses, sales, marketing and distribution expenses and general and administrative expenses based on the nature of the work our employees were assigned to perform. 57 Table of Contents On April 15, 2009, our compensation committee approved a share option exchange program that offered our eligible directors, employees and consultants the right to exchange vested and unvested outstanding share options to purchase our ordinary shares granted under the 2006 Share Incentive Plan for our restricted shares. The exchange ratio was determined based on the fair value of replacement restricted shares so that the fair value of the replacement restricted shares to be issued upon exchange would be approximately equivalent to the fair value of the share options surrendered by an individual. In addition, these replacement restricted shares are subject to substantially the same vesting schedule as the options that are validly tendered in the exchange offer. A total of 154 directors and employees accepted the offer, and tendered options to purchase an aggregate of 9,802,400 ordinary shares in exchange for an aggregate of 4,750,018 restricted shares, which were granted on May 7, 2009. The exchange of the share option awards for restricted shares was accounted for as a modification for awards which involves a cancellation of the original award and an issuance of a new award. We do not expect the effect of this award modification on share-based compensation expense over the remaining requisite service period to be significant. Taxation and Incentives On March 16, 2007, the National Peoples Congress passed the new CIT law which became effective as of January 1, 2008. The new CIT law provides that all enterprises in China, including foreign-invested companies, are subject to a uniform 25% corporate income tax rate and all tax reduction or exemption as well as incentives previously solely available to foreign-invested enterprises are cancelled. However, the new CIT law provides a five-year transition period from its effective date for those enterprises which were established before March 16, 2007 and were entitled to a preferential lower tax rate under the then effective tax laws or regulations as well as grandfathering tax holidays. The transitional tax rates are 18%, 20%, 22%, 24% and 25% for 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 onwards, respectively. In addition, entities previously entitled to a 2+3 tax holiday under the then effective tax laws and regulations shall continue to enjoy the tax holidays until they expire. Further, entities that qualify as Advanced and New Technology Enterprises or ANTEs under the new CIT law are entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 15%. According to the Notice on Prepayment of Corporate Income Tax issued by the State Administration of Taxation, an ANTE recognized according to previous tax regulations prior to January 1, 2008 should be subject to a corporate income tax rate of 25% before it is re-identified as an ANTE under the new CIT law. On April 14, 2008, the Management Measures of Identifying Advanced and New Technology Enterprises and its annex, Key Fields of New and High-Tech Supported by the State, were issued jointly by the Ministry of Science and Technology, State Administration of Tax and the Ministry of Finance that outlines the detailed procedures and measures to identify such ANTEs. In December 2008, Shandong Simcere and Boda were recognized by the Chinese government as ANTEs under the new CIT law and entitled to the preferential income tax rate of 15% from 2008 to 2010. Under the new CIT law, where the transitional preferential income tax policies and the preferential policies prescribed under the new CIT law and its implementation rules overlap, an enterprise shall choose to carry out the most preferential policy, but shall not enjoy multiple preferential policies. Shandong Simcere has chosen to enjoy the 2+3 tax holiday grandfathering treatment until its expiry in 2011. Hainan Simcere and Nanjing Simcere were both converted from domestic companies into foreign-invested enterprises in March 2006. In addition, Shandong Simcere and Tung Chit are foreign-invested enterprises established in 1999 and 2001 respectively. Prior to January 1, 2008, Hainan Simcere, Shandong Simcere, Nanjing Simcere and Tung Chit, being production-oriented foreign investment enterprises, were each entitled to a 2+3 tax holiday. In addition, Hainan Simcere and Shandong Simcere, being located in one of the Special Economic Zones and Economic and Technological Development Zones, respectively, were entitled to a reduced income tax rate of 15%. Further, Shanghai Simcere was located in KangQiao Industrial Area and was granted a reduced income tax rate of 15% for 2007 by the local taxing authority. Hainan Simcere, Nanjing Simcere and Tung Chit completed their two-year full income tax exemption in 2007. As a result of these preferential tax treatments and other local tax incentives, our effective income tax rates were 3.9%, 4.1% and 11.5% in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. 58 Table of Contents The new CIT law also provides that enterprises established outside of China whose de facto management bodies are located in China are considered resident enterprises and are generally subject to the uniform 25% corporate income tax rate as to their worldwide income. Under the implementation rules for the new CIT law issued by the PRC State Council, de facto management body is defined as a body that has material and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and treasury, and acquisition and disposition of properties and other assets of an enterprise. Although substantially all of our operational management is currently based in the PRC, it is unclear whether PRC tax authorities would require (or permit) our overseas registered entities to be treated as PRC resident enterprises. Under the new CIT law and the implementation rules issued by the State Council, PRC income tax at the rate of 10% is applicable to dividends payable to investors that are non-resident enterprises, which do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or which have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends have their sources within the PRC. Similarly, any gain realized on the transfer of ADSs or ordinary shares by such investors is also subject to 10% PRC income tax if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within the PRC. If we are considered a PRC resident enterprise, it is unclear whether dividends we pay with respect to our ordinary shares or ADSs, or the gain you may realize from the transfer of our ordinary shares or ADSs, would be treated as income derived from sources within the PRC and be subject to PRC income tax. It is also unclear whether, if we are considered a PRC resident enterprise, holders of our ordinary shares or ADSs might be able to claim the benefit of income tax treaties entered into between China and other countries. Critical Accounting Policies and the Use of Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, (ii) the disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and (iii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We continually evaluate these estimates based on our own historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions, including the current economic environment, our expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions, which together form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, our actual results could differ from those estimates. We adjust such estimates and assumptions including our estimates of future operations. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Change in these estimates resulting from continuing changes in economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in those estimates and assumptions. Some of our accounting policies also require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application. When reading our financial statements, you should consider (i) our selection of critical accounting policies, (ii) the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies, (iii) the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant judgment and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We grant credit to a portion of our customers in the normal course of business depending on the customers credit worthiness and the type of products we sell to them, although we require some customers to make payment prior to shipment. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We determine the allowance by (1) analyzing specific customer accounts that have known or potential collection issues and (2) applying historical loss rates to the aging of the remaining accounts receivable balances. If circumstances related to specific customers change, our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted. In the event that we believe a trade receivable will become uncollectible, we record additional provision to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts. The accounting effect of this entry is a charge to income. We believe our allowance to doubtful accounts is sufficient to reflect the recoverability of our accounts receivable. If our business grows, we expect our accounts receivable balance to increase, as could our allowance for doubtful accounts. If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates, our 59 Table of Contents uncollectible accounts receivable could exceed our current or future allowances. See Revenues. Our accounts and bills receivables increased as compared to December 31, 2007 as a result of increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 and longer credit period granted to customers. The following table presents the movement of allowance for doubtful accounts in 2006, 2007 and 2008: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 2008 RMB RMB RMB $ (in thousands) Balance at the beginning of the year 5,556 6,834 7,709 1,130 Additions charged to bad debt expense 1,433 1,203 1,576 231 Additions related to acquisitions of subsidiaries  1,074   Write-off of accounts receivable charged against the allowance (155 ) (1,402 ) (1,216 ) (178 ) Balance at the end of the year 6,834 7,709 8,069 1,183 Inventories We value our finished goods inventory at the lower of cost, which consists of the cost of direct labor and raw materials as well as allocation of variable and fixed production overheads, and market value. Variable production overheads are allocated to each unit of production based on the actual use of the production facilities and fixed production overheads are allocated to the cost of conversion based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. We determine normal capacity as being a reasonable level of production volume supported by sufficient customer demand without any abnormal equipment downtime due to shortages of materials and labor. Expenses relating to abnormal levels of idle or excess facilities, spoilage and similar costs are expensed as incurred. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, we did not incur any significant abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses or spoilage as our manufacturing facilities were operating at normal capacity. Our inventory as of December 31, 2008 increased as compared to December 31, 2007 because of the acquisition of the new product, Sinofuan, the launch of the new product, Anxin, and the build-up of inventories to meet the anticipated customer demand in 2009. We write down the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider as obsolete. Finished goods inventory is considered obsolete when it has less than six months of remaining shelf life. Our raw materials and packaging materials are not subject to significant risk of obsolescence. We manage our inventory level based on our estimates of future demand within a specific time period, generally three months or less based on existing customer orders and, to a limited extent, forecasted customer orders. Given our manufacturing plan is primarily based on existing customer orders, we have recorded minimal inventory write-downs in the past. Our inventory write-downs for 2006, 2007 and 2008 were RMB2.1 million, RMB3.2 million and RMB3.0 million ($0.4 million), respectively. Depreciation and Amortization Our long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets such as customer relationships, developed technology and product trademarks, manufacturing licenses and goodwill. Except for goodwill, we amortize our long-lived assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We make estimates of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment (including the salvage values) and intangibles, in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period. We estimate the useful lives at the time we acquire the assets based on our historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipated technological or other changes. If technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated, we might shorten the useful lives assigned to these assets, which will result in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods. There has been no change to the estimated useful lives and salvage values in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill 60 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2008, our intangible assets primarily consisted of developed technology and customer relationships that we acquired in connection with our acquisitions of a 90.0% equity interest in Shandong Simcere, a 51.0% equity interest in Jilin Boda, an 85.71% equity interest in Nanjing Tung Chit and a 70.0% equity interest in Wuhu Simcere Zhong Ren during 2006, 2007 and 2008. We allocate the cost of an acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. This process is commonly referred to as the purchase price allocation. As part of the purchase price allocation, we are required to determine the fair value of any intangible assets acquired. The determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future. The fair values of developed technology and customer relationships were determined by us with inputs from our independent appraisers. The developed technology acquired in connection with our acquisitions represents the right to use, manufacture, market and sell patented and generic pharmaceuticals. These pharmaceuticals include the anti-cancer drug, Endu, the edaravone injection, Yidasheng, the nedaplatin injection, Jiebaishu, and 5-FU sustained release implant, Sinofuan. We estimated the fair value of the developed technology based on an income approach. Under this approach, fair value of an asset is determined based on the present value of projected future net cash flows associated with the use of the asset. The most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income approach when we valued the developed technology include: the growth rate of our revenue from sales; the earnings before interest and tax, or EBIT, margin derived from sales; the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in future cash flows; and our assessment of the product life cycle. We also considered competitive trends influencing the sales, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, and economic barriers to entry. Any material change in any of the key assumptions would affect the fair value of the developed technology which would have an offsetting effect on the amount of goodwill recognized from the acquisitions. Future events, such as market acceptance, introduction of superior pharmaceuticals by our competitors, regulatory actions, safety concerns as to our pharmaceuticals, and challenges to and infringement of our intellectual property rights, could result in write-downs of the carrying value of the developed technology. We estimated the economic useful life of the developed technology by taking into consideration the remaining protection period of the underlying pharmaceuticals patent rights in China and the expected competitive trend in the PRC market. We adopted a straight-line method of amortization for the developed technology as the pattern in which its economic benefits are used up cannot be reliably determined. Material changes in any of our key assumptions would affect the fair value of our developed technology. For customer relationships, the fair value was determined based on an excess earnings or income approach which takes into consideration the projected cash flows to be generated from these customers. Future cash flows are predominately based on the net income forecast of each project and the historical pricing, margins and expense levels of similar products, taking into consideration the relevant market size and growth factors, expected industry trends, individual pharmaceutical product life cycles, and the valid period of each products underlying patent. The resulting cash flows are then discounted at a rate approximating our weighted average cost of capital. We evaluate long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. We estimate the fair value of the asset based on the best information available, including prices for similar assets and in the absence of an observable market price, the results of using a present value technique to estimate the fair value of the asset. For the periods presented, no impairment on our long-lived assets was recorded. We evaluate goodwill at least annually for impairment, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level at the end of each year. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of our reporting unit with the reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill. Secondly, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then recognize an impairment loss for any excess of 61 Table of Contents the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. We determine the implied fair value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. As of December 31, 2007 and 2008, our goodwill balance was RMB161.5 million and RMB178.2 million ($26.1 million), respectively. Our goodwill balance as of December 31, 2007 related to our acquisition of Nanjing Simcere in 2003, our acquisition of 80.0% of Shandong Simcere in September 2006, the acquisition of an additional 10.0% interest in Shandong Simcere in June 2007, the 51.0% interest in Jilin Boda and the 100% interest in Master Luck. The increase in our goodwill balance in 2008 was primarily due to the acquisition of a 70.0% interest in Wuhu Simcere Zhong Ren in April 2008. The fair value of this reporting unit is determined using our market capitalization based on the quoted market price of our ordinary shares for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment. There have been no impairment charges recognized for goodwill in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Share-based Compensation We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), or SFAS No. 123R, on January 1, 2006. Under SFAS No. 123R, we are required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize the cost as an expense in our consolidated statements of income over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. We determined the fair value of options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Under this option pricing model, certain assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, the expected term of the options, the expected dividends on the underlying ordinary shares, and the expected volatility of the price of the underlying share for the expected term of the option, are required in order to determine the fair value of the options. Additionally, our share price on the date of the option grant influences the fair value of the option. Notwithstanding that the exercise price of options approximates the estimated share price of our ordinary shares on the grant date, a higher share price would result in a higher option value. For the purpose of determining the estimated fair value of our share options granted in 2006 and 2007, we believe expected volatility and estimated share price of our ordinary shares are the most sensitive assumptions since we were a privately held company at the time we granted our options. Changes in the volatility assumption and the estimated share price of our ordinary shares could significantly impact the estimated fair values of the options calculated by the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility is estimated based upon the latest five-year average volatility of six guideline companies listed in the United States with similar business as ours, all of which had been trading for at least five years. Guideline companies were used because we did not have a trading history at the time the options were issued and prior to having sufficient share price history to calculate our own historical volatility, we believe that the average volatility of the guideline companies is a reasonable benchmark to use in estimating the expected volatility of our ordinary shares. For options granted in 2008, we used the historical volatility of our shares to estimate the expected volatility. In determining the value of our ordinary shares for purposes of recording share-based compensation for the options granted on November 15, 2006, we have considered the guidance prescribed by the AICPA Audit and Accounting Practice Aid Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the Practice Aid. Specifically, paragraph 16 of the Practice Aid sets forth the preferred types of valuation that should be used. We have followed the level A recommendation, the most preferred method of valuation recommended by the Practice Aid, and established the fair value of our ordinary shares at the date of grant using a contemporaneous valuation by an independent valuation firm, American Appraisal China Limited, or American Appraisal, as of November 15, 2006. American Appraisal used a weighted average of equity value derived by using a combination of the income approach, or the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, or the guideline company method. American Appraisal applied an equal weight for both the market approach and the income approach to arrive at the fair value for our ordinary shares. There was no significant difference between our enterprise value, or EV, derived using the income approach and our EV derived using the market approach. For the market approach, American Appraisal considered the market profile and performance of the six guideline companies and used such information to derive market multiples. American Appraisal then calculated the following three multiples for the guideline companies: EV to sales multiple, EV to earnings before interest, tax, 62 Table of Contents depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, multiple and EV to earnings before interest and tax, or EBIT, multiple. Due to the different growth rates, profit margins and risk levels between us and the guideline companies, price multiple adjustments were made. American Appraisal used the 2007 adjusted median price multiples of the guideline companies in the valuation of our ordinary shares. For the income approach, American Appraisal utilized discounted cash flow, or DCF, analysis based on our projected cash flows from 2006 through 2011. American Appraisal used a weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, of 15.0%, based on the WACC of the guideline companies. American Appraisal also applied a discount for lack of marketability of 11.0% to reflect the fact that there was no ready market for shares in a closely held company like us. When determining the discount for lack of marketability, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. Under this option pricing method, the cost of the put option, which can hedge the price change before the privately held shares can be sold, was considered as a basis to determine the discount for lack of marketability. This option pricing method was used because it takes into account certain company-specific factors, including our size and the volatility of the share price of the guideline companies engaged in the same industry. Volatility of 40.0% was determined by using the mean of volatility of the guideline companies used in the market approach. The above assumptions used by American Appraisal in deriving the fair values were consistent with our business plan and major milestones achieved by us. American Appraisal also applied other general assumptions, including the following:  no material changes in the existing political, legal, fiscal and economic conditions and pharmaceutical industry in China;  no major changes in tax law in China or the tax rates applicable to our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities in China;  exchange rates between the Renminbi and U.S. dollar will not differ materially from current rates;  our future growth will not be constrained by the lack of funding;  our continuing ability to retain competent management and key personnel to support our ongoing operations; and  industry trends and market conditions for the pharmaceutical and related industries will not deviate significantly from economic forecasts. With respect to the options granted on March 29, 2007, our board of directors determined that the midpoint of the estimated price range for our initial public offering of $6.75 was a reasonable measure of the fair value of our ordinary shares. For the options granted on November 15, 2006, we used an expected volatility of 40.0%, estimated share price of our ordinary shares of $4.16, expected term of the options of 5.5 years, expected dividend yield of 0.0% and a risk-free interest rate of 5.11%, resulting in an estimated fair value per option of $1.88. For the options granted on March 29, 2007, the same assumptions are used except that the estimated share price of our ordinary shares used was $6.75, resulting in an estimated fair value per option of $3.05. For the options granted on May 5, 2008, we used the closing price of our ordinary shares of $6.755, an expected volatility of 58.8%, expected term of the options of 5.35 years, expected dividend yield of 0.0% and a risk-free interest rate of 3.69%, resulting in an estimated fair value per option of $3.73. For the options granted on December 24, 2008, we used the closing price of our ordinary shares of $3.445, an expected volatility of 74.4%, expected term of the options of 5.19 years, expected dividend yield of 0.0% and a risk-free interest rate of 1.54%, resulting in an estimated fair value per option of $2.13. 63 Table of Contents Income tax uncertainties and realization of deferred tax assets Our income tax provision, related deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized and measured based on actual and expected future income, PRC statutory income tax rates, PRC tax regulations and tax planning strategies. Significant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the PRC, evaluating uncertain tax positions, and assessing the likelihood of realizing deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ materially from those judgments, and changes in judgments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007 and 2008, we had total gross deferred tax assets of RMB36.1 million and RMB35.6 million ($5.2 million), respectively. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, we believe expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. We evaluate the level of our valuation allowances quarterly, and more frequently if actual operating results differ significantly from forecasted results. At December 31, 2007 and 2008, our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was RMB26.1 million and RMB24.5 million ($3.6 million), respectively. Our total income tax expense was increased/(decreased) by RMB4.2 million, RMB15.6 million and (RMB1.6 million) (($0.2 million)) in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively, for changes in estimates regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets. The change in valuation allowance for 2008 consisted primarily of an increase of RMB9.6 million ($1.4 million) mainly for Jiangsu Simceres additional tax losses and a decrease of RMB11.1 million ($1.6 million) for release of Simcere Researchs 2007 valuation allowance, of which RMB10.1 million ($1.5 million) utilized in 2008, as it moved from a cumulative loss position to a cumulative profit position. As of December 31, 2008, our management reassessed the valuation allowance of Simcere Research and concluded that it was more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income would be generated to realize its deferred tax assets. On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes or FIN 48. Upon adoption of FIN 48, we reclassified RMB14.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits for which a cash tax payment is not expected within the next twelve months to long-term liabilities in 2007. Our adoption of FIN 48 did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of our retained earnings. Under FIN 48, we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it is presumed that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. In addition, a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. The tax positions are regularly reevaluated based on the results of the examination of income tax filings, statute of limitations expirations and changes in tax law that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to the more likely than not recognition threshold. In the normal course of business, we are regularly audited by the PRC tax authorities. The settlement of any particular issue with the applicable taxing authority could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations The following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated. Our historical results presented below are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other future period. 64 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 % of Total % of Total % of Total RMB Revenues RMB Revenues RMB Revenues (in thousands, except percentages) Product revenues 947,797 99.7 1,363,014 99.6 1,736,832 99.8 Other revenue (1) 2,809 0.3 5,734 0.4 4,311 0.2 Total revenues 950,606 100.0 1,368,748 100.0 1,741,143 100.0 Cost of materials and production (190,560 ) (20.0 ) (241,081 ) (17.6 ) (320,882 ) (18.4 ) Gross profit 760,046 80.0 1,127,667 82.4 1,420,261 81.6 Operating expenses: Research and development expenses (34,289 ) (3.6 ) (68,295 ) (4.9 ) (86,089 ) (4.9 ) Sales, marketing and distribution expenses (442,757 ) (46.6 ) (634,449 ) (46.4 ) (782,960 ) (45.0 ) General and administrative expenses (98,249 ) (10.3 ) (161,061 ) (11.8 ) (194,233 ) (11.2 ) Total operating expenses 575,295 (60.5 ) (863,805 ) (63.1 ) (1,063,282 ) (61.1 ) Income from operations 184,751 19.5 263,862 19.3 356,979 20.5 Interest income 2,827 0.3 24,361 1.8 34,302 2.0 Interest expense (10,705 ) (1.2 ) (6,346 ) (0.5 ) (4,693 ) (0.3 ) Foreign currency exchange gains, net   24,670 1.8 39,879 2.3 Other income (1)   20,526 1.5 1,104 0.1 Earnings before income taxes and minority interests 176,873 18.6 327,073 23.9 427,571 24.6 Income tax expense (6,952 ) (0.7 ) (13,527 ) (1.0 ) (49,285 ) (2.8 ) Income before minority interests 169,921 17.9 313,546 22.9 378,286 21.8 Minority interests 2,337 0.3 (12,285 ) (0.9 ) (28,135 ) (1.7 ) Net income (2)(3) 172,258 18.2 301,261 22.0 350,151 20.1 (1) In 2007, in the Form 6-K furnished with the SEC on August 7, 2007 for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, an incentive payment of RMB20.5 million we received from our depositary in connection with the establishment of the ADR program following our initial public offering was erroneously classified as part of other revenue. Such incentive payment is reclassified as other nonoperating income. (2) In 2007 and 2008, other income represented the incentive payment received from our depositary in connection with the establishment of the ADR program following our initial public offering.

B. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity and Capital Resources Following is a summary of our net cash flows for the years indicated: 68 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 2008 RMB RMB RMB $ (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 118,951 150,415 147,158 21,568 Net cash (used in)/provided by investing activities (259,196 ) (695,974 ) 252,668 37,035 Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities 156,212 938,383 (88,846 ) (13,022 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  (1,499 ) 4,482 657 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 15,967 391,325 315,462 46,238 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 90,060 106,027 497,352 72,899 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year 106,027 497,352 812,814 119,137 To date, we have financed our operations primarily through cash flows from operations, short-term bank borrowings, equity contributions by our shareholders and our initial public offering in April 2007. We have been able to increase our revenue and net income and generate positive cash flows from operations in each of 2006, 2007 and 2008. We were also able to repay our obligations and bank borrowings when they became due. As of December 31, 2008, we had RMB6.0 million ($0.9 million) and RMB62.0 million ($9.1 million) in outstanding short-term borrowings and outstanding long term-loans, respectively. The outstanding short-term borrowings represent a RMB3.0 million ($0.4 million) unsecured interest-free borrowing from a local district government in Shandong Province which we obtained for working capital purposes and a 3.0 million ($0.4 million) current-portion of long-term loan. The outstanding long-term debts represent a RMB10.0 million ($1.5 million) non-current portion of long -term loan from the local district government in Shandong Province, which is secured and repayable over a 2-year period from 2010 to 2011, and a floating interest rate long-term loan of RMB52.0 million ($7.6 million) from the local district government in Jilin Province to finance the construction of a new production facility in Jilin Province. The floating interest rate long-term loan is repayable over an 11-year period from 2010 to 2020. The weighted-average effective interest rate on long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2008 was 6.90% per annum. As of December 31, 2008, we also had RMB812.8 million ($119.1 million) in cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on hand, cash deposited in banks and interest-bearing savings accounts. We had benefited from the low interest rate, abundant credit environment pre-dating the current economic environment that allowed our customers to obtain credit to purchase our products and to finance their projects utilizing our products on attractive terms. Given the current economic environment, particularly the tightening of the credit markets, we have extended the time period before payments are due, which have created additional demands on our working capital. Our accounts and bills receivables as of December 31, 2008 increased as compared to December 31, 2007 as a result of increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 and longer credit period granted to customers. In November 2008, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program with a view to demonstrate our commitment to maximize shareholder value. Under the share repurchase program, we may repurchase up to $50.0 million worth of our issued and outstanding ADSs from the open market or in block trades from time to time for a period of 12 months from the date of such authorization. As of December 31, 2008, we have repurchased 3.0 million of our ordinary shares in the form of ADSs for an aggregate cost of $10.0 million which included $0.1 million of handling charge. As of December 31, 2008, all of the purchased ordinary shares have been retired. From January 1, 2009 to May 31, 2009, we further repurchased an additional 7.0 million ordinary shares in the form of ADSs for an aggregate cost of $22.6 million of which included $0.1 million of handling charge. All of the repurchased ordinary shares have been retired. The repurchases were made on the open market at prevailing market prices or in block trades and subject to restrictions relating to volume, price and timing. Any future repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements and other factors. 69 Table of Contents We believe that our current levels of cash and cash flows from operations and bank borrowings and loans will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs and commitments, including our working capital needs, for at least the next 12 months. However, we may need additional cash resources in the future if we experience changed business conditions or other developments. We may also need additional cash resources in the future if we find and wish to pursue opportunities for investment, acquisition, strategic cooperation or other similar actions. If we ever determine that our cash requirements exceed our amounts of cash and cash equivalents on hand, we may seek to issue debt or equity securities or obtain a credit facility. Any issuance of equity securities could cause dilution for our shareholders. Any incurrence of indebtedness could increase our debt service obligations and cause us to be subject to restrictive operating and finance covenants. It is possible that, when we need additional cash resources, financing will only be available to us in amounts or on terms that would not be acceptable to us or financing will not be available at all. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 2.2% to RMB147.2 million ($21.6 million) in 2008 from RMB150.4 million in 2007. This decrease was due primarily to a slower rate of cash collections from our customers. This was because more customers chose to make payments with bills receivable instead of cash. Bills receivable are short-term notes receivable issued primarily by a financial institution that entitle us to receive the full face amount at maturity, which generally ranges from three to six months from the date of issuance. Although the increased use of bills receivable by our customers has an adverse impact on the timing of our cash inflows from operating activities, it significantly reduces our credit risk exposure. As our business continues to expand, we expect more customers to make payments with bills receivable instead of cash. In order to manage our liquidity and maintain our accounts receivable turnover days at a reasonable level, we sold more bills receivable to financial institutions during 2008. The net decrease in cash provided by operating activities was also due to the decrease in other payable and accrued liabilities as a result of faster processing of sales and marketing expenses by sales agents and employees in 2008 compared to 2007. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 26.5% to RMB150.4 million in 2007 from RMB119.0 million in 2006. This increase was due primarily to the receipt of an incentive payment of RMB20.5 million in 2007 from our depositary in connection with the establishment of our ADR program, the decrease in cash payments for income taxes to RMB3.1 million in 2007 from RMB22.7 million in 2006 and the decrease in interest payments, which was partially offset by higher accounts and bills receivable. The higher accounts and bills receivable was due primarily to higher bills receivable which have longer settlement period between three to six months where normal accounts receivable have a credit period of one to three months. Bills receivable is a short-term notes receivable issued by a financial institution that entitles us to receive the full face amount from the financial institution at maturity. As we expand our distribution network, we accept more bills receivable even though the settlement period is longer because the credit risk is minimal. Furthermore, although we accepted an increasing amount of bills receivable, the cash generated from the significant increase in sales has more than offset the effect of a longer cash collection cycle resulted from the higher bills receivable. We do not expect any significant change to the credit terms offered to our customers or the payment terms offered by our vendors that would affect the timing of customer receipts and vendor payments in the foreseeable future periods. We expect cash provided from operating activities to continue to be a major source of liquidity for us and the future trend will continue to be affected by the factors described above. Investing Activities Investing activities provided net cash of RMB252.7 million ($37.0 million) during 2008, mainly from the maturity of held-to-maturity investment securities investments of RMB470.0 million ($68.9 million), partially offset by payment for the acquisition of the 70% equity interest in Wuhu Simcere Zhong Ren of RMB62.4 million ($9.1 million) and for purchases of property, plant and equipment of RMB117.5 million ($17.2 million). Net cash used in investing activities increased significantly to RMB696.0 million in 2007 from RMB259.2 million in 2006. Net cash used in investing activities in 2007 consisted primarily of increase in short-term investments of RMB470.0 million, aggregate cash payment of RMB158.6 million in connection with our acquisitions of the 10.0% equity interest in Shandong Simcere, the 51.0% equity interest in Jilin Boda and the 70 Table of Contents 85.71% equity interest in Nanjing Tung Chit and cash payments totaling RMB98.6 million for the costs of obtaining land use rights and the purchases of property, plant and equipment. Financing Activities Financing activities used net cash of RMB88.8 million ($13.0 million) during 2008, primarily for the repurchase of our ordinary shares of RMB76.9 million ($11.3 million) and repayment of short-term borrowings of RMB17.0 million ($2.5 million). In November 2008, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program that we may purchase up to $50.0 million (RMB341.1 million) worth of our issued and outstanding ADSs. We expect to implement this share repurchase program over the course of 12 months from the date of the authorization and plan to fund the share repurchase program through our available cash received from our initial public offering in April 2007. Net cash provided by financing activities increased significantly to RMB938.4 million in 2007 from RMB156.2 million in 2006. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 mainly consisted of cash received from our initial public offering in April, which was partially offset by increase in repayment of bank borrowings. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 mainly consisted of short-term bank and other borrowings and capital contribution, loans and advances from Assure Ahead Investments Limited in connection with its investment in our company in March 2006 which were partially offset by principal payments on bank borrowings and the distribution payment to New Good Management Limited in connection with our reorganization. Capital expenditures In 2006, 2007 and 2008, our capital expenditures totaled RMB91.9 million, RMB98.6 million and RMB136.8 million ($20.1 million), respectively. In past years, our capital expenditures consisted primarily of the costs of obtaining land use rights and the purchases of property, plant and equipment and our research and development facilities. We estimate that our capital expenditures in 2009 will be approximately RMB298.5 million, which we will use mainly for the purchase of equipment in connection with the expansion of our research and development facilities, and new office buildings in Jiangsu Province and Shanghai. We expect to use cash generated by operating activities and our cash in hand to pay for our capital expenditures in 2009. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2008, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements (note 20). The initial adoption of SFAS No. 157 had no impact on our financial position and results of operations. FASB Staff Position No. FAS No. 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, (FSP FAS 157-2) delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. In accordance with FSP FAS 157-2, we have not applied the provisions of SFAS No. 157 to the intangible assets acquired in business combinations during 2008 that have been recognized or disclosed at fair value for the year ended December 31, 2008. On January 1, 2009, we will be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157 to fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. We do not expect the initial impact of adopting FSP FAS 157-2 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS No. 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active (FSP FAS 157-3) which was effective 71 Table of Contents immediately. FSP FAS 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 in cases where the market for a financial instrument is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining fair value in those circumstances. We have considered the guidance provided by FSP FAS 157-3 in its determination of estimated fair values during 2008. In April 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS No. 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly (FSP FAS 157-4). FSP FAS 157-4 relates to determining fair values when there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales. It reaffirms what SFAS No. 157 states is the objective of fair value measurementto reflect how much an asset would be sold for in an orderly transaction (as opposed to a distressed or forced transaction) at the date of the financial statements under current market conditions. Specifically, it reaffirms the need to use judgment to ascertain if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when markets have become inactive. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009, but entities may adopt this guidance earlier for the interim and annual periods ending after March 15, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact that FSP FAS 157-4 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 141R, Business Combination (SFAS No. 141R), which replaces FASB Statement No. 141. SFAS No. 141R provides revised guidance on the recognition and measurement of the consideration transferred, identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired in a business combination. SFAS No. 141R also expands required disclosure surrounding the nature and financial effects of business combinations. SFAS No. 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. We plan to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 141R on January 1, 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 141R will impact the accounting for business combinations completed by us on or after January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an Amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the treatment of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary. Noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary will be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements and any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary will initially be measured at fair value. SFAS No. 160 is effective, on a prospective basis, for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. However, presentation and disclosure requirements must be retrospectively applied to comparative financial statements. We plan to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 160 on January 1, 2009. The initial adoption of SFAS 160 is expected to only result in the reclassification and presentation of minority interests as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements In December 2007, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 07-1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements (EITF No. 07-1). EITF No. 07-1 provides guidance regarding financial statement presentation and disclosure of collaborative arrangements, which includes arrangements entered into regarding development and commercialization of products. It requires certain transactions between collaborators to be recorded in the statements of income on either a gross or net basis when certain characteristics exist in the collaborative relationship. EITF 07-1 became effective for us on January 1, 2009. The initial adoption of EITF 07-1 is not expected to have an effect on our financial position and results of operations. However, the adoption of EITF 07-1 may have an effect on the presentation of collaborative arrangements in the consolidated statements of income and could result in the reporting of lower amounts of product revenues and research and development expenses. In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS No. 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP FAS 142-3). FSP FAS 142-3 provides guidance with respect to estimating the useful lives of recognized intangible assets acquired on or after the effective date and requires additional disclosure related to the renewal or extension of the terms of recognized intangible assets. FSP FAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of FSP FAS 142-3 to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. 72 Table of Contents C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc. Our Strategy We aim to balance our research and development efforts between the development of first-to-market generic pharmaceuticals and innovative pharmaceuticals. We perform thorough market analysis before commencing a research and development project to determine whether the pharmaceutical is commercially viable, is able to achieve widespread acceptance in the marketplace, and for new generic pharmaceuticals, whether such generic pharmaceutical will be the first generic version on the market. We focus our research and development efforts on pharmaceuticals used to treat diseases with a high incidence and/or mortality rate that, at the same time, lack effective pharmacotherapy, such as cancer, cerebrovascular diseases, strokes, rheumatoid arthritis and infectious diseases. We believe such research and development strategy will lead to the development of products that have a high potential for commercialization and can maximize our growth rate and profit margins. In addition, we will continue to enhance our existing portfolio of pharmaceuticals by improving their convenience (such as the reduction in the frequency of administering medicines) and/or their therapeutic benefits. Our research and development team also assists our production department in resolving technical issues and improving manufacturing processes and techniques. Our Capability As of December 31, 2008, we had 205 research staff, 101 of which held masters degrees and 27 of which held Ph.D. degrees. Our research and development activities are primarily conducted by our operating subsidiary in China, Simcere Research, located in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province. See 
