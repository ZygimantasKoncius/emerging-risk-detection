Item 1A. Risk Factors Our results could be affected by the risk factors discussed below. These factors may also cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by forward-looking statements in our Managements Discussion and Analysis. Investors should consider these factors in reading this document. If deteriorating economic conditions alter the frequency and severity patterns utilized in our estimates for reserves for losses, we may be required to take additional charges to earnings. Our reserve for losses is based upon the existing level of delinquent loans and our estimate of the ultimate amount for claims that will be paid on those existing delinquent loans. The estimate of losses is based upon the historical frequency and severity patterns of the migration from delinquent loan status to actual claim paid status, adjusted for shifts in the underlying mix and age of business. To the extent that possible future adverse economic conditions such as increasing unemployment rates or declining housing prices alter those historical frequency and severity patterns, actual paid claims on the existing delinquent loans may be greater than the reserves that we have provided and require a charge to earnings. Since, consistent with industry practice, we generally provide reserves only for loans in default that have been reported to us and an estimate of loans in default not yet reported to us, any increase in the level of delinquent loans reported would require an increase to reserves and a charge to earnings. Reserves are provided for the estimated costs of settling claims on loans reported in default and estimates of loans in default that are in the process of being reported to the Company. Consistent with industry accounting practices, the Company does not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans that are not currently in default. We generally do not establish reserves until we are notified that a borrower has failed to make at least two payments when due. Deterioration of general economic conditions such as increasing unemployment rates or declining housing prices could adversely alter the historical delinquency patterns resulting in an increase in the level of loans in default. An increase in the level of loans in default would require additional reserves and a charge to earnings as they are reported to us. Because our business is concentrated among relatively few major lenders, our revenues and net income could decline if we lose a significant customer. Our business depends on a relatively small number of customers. Our top ten lenders were responsible for approximately three quarters of our primary new insurance written during the last two years. Additionally, our top two lenders were responsible for approximately half of our Primary new insurance written during the last two years. This concentration of business may increase as a result of further consolidation in the lending industry or other factors. The loss of business from one or more of our major lenders could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. If housing values fail to appreciate or decline significantly, we may incur a higher level of losses from paid claims and also be required to increase reserves. An essential component of our mitigation efforts on mortgage insurance claims is our option of paying our coverage percentage in full satisfaction of our obligations under the policy or paying off the entire loan amount and taking title to the mortgaged property underlying a defaulted loan. The critical assumption behind the purchase option is that the property has appreciated in value since the loan was originated and that we will be able to recover some, or the entire amount at risk, through the acquisition and subsequent sale of the property. We have been 22 Table of Contents successful to date in our ability to take title to properties and sell them at prices that mitigate these losses. Further, the assumptions utilized in our reserve methodology also have factored in a certain amount of loss mitigation resulting from the utilization of the purchase option. If housing values fail to appreciate or begin to decline, our ability to mitigate our losses on defaulted mortgages may be reduced, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Because a growing portion our business is sensitive to interest rates, a significant increase in rates would cause higher monthly mortgage payments for borrowers that could lead to a greater number of defaults, which would adversely impact our business. A growing portion of our mortgage insurance in force is on adjustable-rate mortgage loans or ARMs. Monthly payments on these loans are altered periodically through an adjustment of the interest rate. Many ARMs have a fixed interest rate for a stated period of time, and accordingly, have not yet been subject to an interest rate adjustment. In periods of rising interest rates, a borrowers monthly payment will increase. A significant increase in interest rates over a short period of time could lead to payment shocks for borrowers that could potentially lead to more reported defaults. In addition, we insure a small percentage of interest-only mortgages, a variation of an ARM, where the borrower pays only the interest charge on a mortgage for a specified period of time, usually five to ten years, after which the loan payment increases to include principal payments. These interest-only loans may have a heightened propensity to default because of possible payment shocks after the initial low-payment period expires and because the borrower does not automatically build equity through loan amortization as payments are made. If interest rates increase causing payment shock to borrowers with ARMs, our default rate could increase which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. The premiums we charge for mortgage insurance on non-prime loans, ARMs and Alt-A loans may not be adequate to compensate for future losses from these products. Our new insurance written includes non-prime loans, ARMs and Alt-A loans that have an increased premium over prime, fixed rate and fully documented loans. The credit quality, loss development and persistency on these loans can vary significantly from our traditional prime loan business. For example, we have experienced higher delinquency and claims rates, and higher average claims paid amounts on the Alt-A loans than in our prime flow portfolios. We expect that we will continue to experience higher default rates for non-prime loans, Alt-A loans and ARMs than for our prime fixed rate loans. We cannot be sure that the premiums including the additional risk charge that we charge on non-prime, ARMs and Alt-A loans will adequately offset the associated risk which could adversely impact operating results. A growing portion of our insurance in force consists of loans with high loan-to-value ratios or loans that are non-prime or both, which could result in more and larger claims than loans with lower loan-to-value ratios or prime loans. A growing portion of our mortgage insurance in force consists of insurance on mortgage loans with LTVs at origination of more than 95%. When we are required to pay a claim on a higher LTV loan, it is generally more difficult to recover our costs from the underlying property, especially in areas with declining property values. Therefore, if we experience a higher default rate on higher LTV loans, our results of operations could be adversely affected. We also insure non-prime loans. The majority of the non-prime loans we insure are known as Alt-A loans, which have credit scores commensurate with prime loans but are processed with reduced or no documentation. Our Alt-A loans also tend to have larger loan balances relative to our other loans. Because we have been insuring non-prime loans for a limited period of time, we are still developing data regarding the performance of these loans and there can be no assurance that our estimated default rates and losses will match our actual results. If our estimates prove to be inaccurate, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. Further, we cannot be sure that the increased premiums that we charge for mortgage insurance on non-prime loans will be adequate to compensate us for the losses we incur on these products. 23 Table of Contents A downgrade or potential downgrade of the financial strength ratings assigned to our primary insurance subsidiary could weaken its competitive position. One or more of S&P, Moodys or Fitch could downgrade the financial strength ratings assigned to our primary insurance subsidiary, Triad Guaranty Insurance Corporation, if they believe that we have experienced adverse developments in our business, financial condition or operating results. These ratings are important to our ability to market our products and to maintain our competitive position and customer confidence in our products. A downgrade in these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. If the financial strength rating assigned to our insurance subsidiary were to fall below Aa3 from Moodys or the AA− level from S&P and Fitch, then mortgage lenders would not purchase mortgage insurance from us and a large segment of the mortgage securitization market, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, generally would not purchase mortgages or mortgage-backed securities insured by us. Changes in the business practices or legislation relating to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could significantly impact our business. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the beneficiaries of the majority of our policies, so their business practices have a significant influence on us. Changes in their practices could reduce the number of policies they purchase that are insured by us and consequently reduce our revenues. Some of Fannie Mae and Freddie Macs newer programs require less insurance coverage than they historically have required, and they have the ability to further reduce or eliminate coverage requirements, which would reduce demand for mortgage insurance and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also have the ability to implement new eligibility requirements for mortgage insurers and to alter or liberalize underwriting standards on low-down-payment mortgages they purchase which thereby affect the quality of the risk insured by the mortgage insurer and the availability of mortgage loans. Additionally, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can alter the terms on which mortgage insurance coverage can be canceled before reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law, and the circumstances in which mortgage servicers must perform activities intended to avoid or mitigate loss on insured mortgages that are delinquent. We cannot predict the extent to which any new requirements may be enacted or how they may affect the operations of our mortgage insurance business, our capital requirements and our products. Legislation and regulatory changes, including changes impacting the GSEs, could significantly affect our business and could reduce demand for private mortgage insurance. Mortgage origination transactions are subject to compliance with various federal and state consumer protection laws, including the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, or RESPA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and others. Among other things, these laws prohibit payments for referrals of settlement service business, require fairness and non-discrimination in granting or facilitating the granting of credit, require cancellation of insurance and refunding of unearned premiums under certain circumstances, govern the circumstances under which companies may obtain and use consumer credit information, and define the manner in which companies may pursue collection activities. Changes in these laws or regulations could adversely affect our operations and profitability. Congress is currently considering proposed legislation relating to the regulatory oversight of the GSEs, their affordable housing initiatives, the GSEs products and marketing activities, the GSEs minimum capital standards, and their risk-based capital requirements. If adopted in its present form, OFHEO would be replaced by a new federal agency, the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Agency, and its director would be given significant authority over the GSEs including, among other things, oversight of the operations of the GSEs, capital adequacy and internal controls and new program approval. The proposed legislation encompasses substantially all of the operations of the GSEs and is intended to be a comprehensive overhaul of the existing regulatory structure. The proposed legislation could limit the growth of the GSEs, which could result in a reduction in the size of the mortgage insurance market. We do not know what form, if any, such legislation will take, if any, or, if it is enacted, its impact, if any, on our financial condition and results of operations. 24 Table of Contents In addition, increases in the maximum loan amount or other features of the FHA mortgage insurance program can reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance. Future legislative and regulatory actions could decrease the demand for private mortgage insurance, which could harm our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Our revenues and profits could decline if we lose market share as a result of industry competition or if our competitive position suffers as a result of our inability to introduce and successfully market new products and programs. There are seven main mortgage insurance providers, of which we are the smallest. The mortgage insurance industry is highly dynamic and intensely competitive. The private mortgage insurance providers are Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation, PMI Mortgage Insurance Company, Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation, United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company, Radian Guaranty, Inc and Republic Mortgage Insurance Company. Two of these are subsidiaries of well-capitalized companies with stronger insurance financial strength ratings and greater access to capital than we have. If we are unable to compete successfully against other private mortgage insurers, all of which are larger than we are or if we experience delays in introducing competitive new products and programs or if these products or programs are less profitable than our existing products and programs, our business will suffer If mortgage lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance, the amount of insurance that we write could decline, which could reduce our revenues and profits. Competition for private mortgage insurance premiums occurs not only among private mortgage insurers but also with mortgage lenders through captive mortgage reinsurance transactions. In these transactions, a lenders affiliate reinsures a portion of the insurance written by a private mortgage insurer on mortgages originated or serviced by the lender. Our captive reinsurance program reduces the amount of net premium that we collect through risk sharing, and if we did not establish proper terms or rates, our profitability could suffer. In addition, there are an increasing number of alternatives to traditional private mortgage insurance, and new alternatives may develop, which could reduce the demand for our mortgage insurance. Existing alternatives include:  mortgage lenders structuring mortgage originations to avoid private mortgage insurance utilizing 80-10-10 structures; over the past several years, the volume of these loans, or variations of them, as alternatives to loans requiring mortgage insurance, has increased significantly and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future;  investors using credit enhancements as a partial or complete substitute for private mortgage insurance;  lenders and investors holding mortgages in their portfolios and self-insuring;  member institutions providing credit enhancement on loans sold to a Federal Home Loan Bank, or FHLB, which do not have the same requirements for mortgage insurance as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Changes in regulatory requirements could impact captive mortgage insurance arrangements for all industry participants. State insurance departments or other officials may conduct investigations or reviews of our business practices such as our captive reinsurance or other risk sharing arrangements. The anti-referral fee provisions of RESPA provide that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as well as the insurance commissioner or attorney general of any state may bring an action to enjoin violations of these provisions of RESPA. The insurance law provisions of many states prohibit paying for the referral of insurance business and provide various mechanisms to enforce this prohibition. In the summer of 2005, we received an inquiry from the New York Insurance Department relating to captive mortgage insurance arrangements for which we have responded fully. In January of 2006, we received a request for information from the Minnesota Insurance Department regarding our lender captive reinsurance arrangements. While we believe our captive reinsurance arrangements are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such reviews or investigations nor is it possible to predict their effect on Triad or the entire mortgage insurance industry. 25 Table of Contents Since we generally cannot cancel mortgage insurance policies or adjust renewal premiums, unanticipated claims could cause our financial performance to suffer. We generally cannot cancel the mortgage insurance coverage that we provide or adjust renewal premiums during the life of a mortgage insurance policy. As a result, the impact of unanticipated claims generally cannot be offset by premium increases on policies in force or limited by non-renewal or cancellation of insurance coverage. The premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for the risks and costs associated with the insurance coverage provided to our customers. An increase in the number or size of unanticipated claims could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Our loss experience is likely to increase as our policies continue to age. We expect the majority of claims on insured loans in our current portfolio to occur during the second through the fifth years after loan origination. Primary insurance written from the period of January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2004 represented 64.4% of our Primary risk in force as of December 31, 2005. Accordingly, a significant majority of our Primary portfolio is in, or approaching, its peak claim years. In addition, our 2003 book of business represents 26.3% of its insurance in force as of December 31, 2005, and we believe that it entered its peak claim year in 2005 and will have a continued impact in 2006. We believe our loss experience is likely to increase as our policies age. If the claim frequency on our risk in force significantly exceeds the claim frequency that was assumed in setting our premium rates, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our revenues and DAC amortization depend on the renewal of policies that may terminate or fail to renew. The large majority of our premiums each month have been derived from the monthly renewal of policies that we previously have written. Factors that could cause an increase in non-renewals of our policies include falling mortgage interest rates (which tend to lead to increased refinancings and associated cancellations of mortgage insurance), appreciating home values which can lead to more refinances and mortgage insurance cancellations, and changes in the mortgage insurance cancellation requirements applicable to mortgage lenders and homeowners. Additionally, the amount of DAC amortization expense would be adversely impacted if policies terminate at a rate faster than was originally estimated in our DAC models. A decrease in the length of time that our mortgage insurance policies remain in force reduces our revenues and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims. A significant percentage of our new insurance written is underwritten pursuant to a delegated underwriting program. These programs permit certain mortgage lenders to determine whether mortgage loans meet our program guidelines and enables these lenders to commit us to issue mortgage insurance. We may expand the availability of delegated underwriting to additional customers. If an approved lender commits us to insure a mortgage loan, generally, we may not refuse, except in limited circumstances, to insure, or rescind coverage on, that loan even if the lender fails to follow our delegated underwriting guidelines. Even if we terminate a lenders underwriting authority, we remain at risk for any loans previously insured on our behalf by the lender before that termination. The performance of loans insured through programs of delegated underwriting has not been tested over a period of extended adverse economic conditions, meaning that the program could lead to greater losses than we anticipate. Greater than anticipated losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. 26 Table of Contents
