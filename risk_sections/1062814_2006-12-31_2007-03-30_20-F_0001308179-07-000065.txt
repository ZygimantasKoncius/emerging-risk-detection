Risk Factors You should carefully consider the following risks and other information contained in this Annual Report. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we consider immaterial based on information currently available to us may also materially adversely affect our Company. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the risks we face as described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Cautionary Note About Forward-looking Statements. Operational Risks We are an international group of companies and are exposed to general economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have operations. We operate as an international group of companies, which exposes us to the economic conditions, political risks and the specific regulations of the countries in which we operate. In addition to Europe and North America, where we generated 51% and 16%, respectively, of our 2006 net sales, we operate in the Latin America and Asia-Pacific regions, which are areas in which we have focused our growth strategy. In 2006, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region represented 15% and 18%, respectively, of our net sales. Our strategy is to seize development opportunities in growing markets, principally in China, South Korea and Brazil. Our presence on these markets exposes us to risks such as sudden, material changes in regulations, political, financial and social instability, exchange rate fluctuations, the outbreak of major health risks, transfer of payment regulations or withholding taxes that may create difficulties in repatriating local currencies or investing in such countries, or difficulties in obtaining local financing. The occurrence of such events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Certain markets in which we are involved are very competitive. While the degree of our exposure to competition in the markets in which we operate varies significantly, we face intense competition in certain markets. The competitive pressure that we are exposed to may result from the following factors, among others: strong price competition, primarily caused by overcapacity, competition from low-cost producers and consolidation among our customers and competitors. New products or technologies developed by competitors may also have a material adverse impact on our competitive position. The cyclicality in some of the industries we serve could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our results are affected by cyclicality in various industries we serve, either directly or indirectly, including the consumer, automotive, electronics, construction and textile industries. Our results of operations and financial condition in the past have been adversely affected by a decrease in demand in certain sectors. Fluctuations in price and demand within the sectors that we operate could continue, and we could continue to experience periods of overcapacity, declining prices and lower profit margins. Our efforts to refocus our activities on areas that are less affected by this cyclicality are designed to reduce our exposure to these negative effects. In addition, external factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, competitors actions, international events and circumstances and governmental regulation in France, the United States, China and other jurisdictions , may cause volatility in raw material prices and product demand, as well as fluctuations in our prices, volumes and margins. Form 20-F 2006  Rhodia - 9 Back to Contents Sustained high raw materials and energy prices increase our production costs and the cost of goods sold, so that the time it takes to pass on increases in such costs to our customers may reduce our operating income in the short term. A significant portion of our raw materials costs are based on petroleum products, in particular, those derived from benzene. We are therefore indirectly exposed to volatility in the price of oil that may result from instability in oil-producing regions and are directly exposed to increases in the price of benzene. We are also exposed to volatility in the price of our other principal raw materials, including natural gas. Our ability to maintain operating margins depends on our ability to pass on increases in raw material and energy prices through price increases, which can often be difficult. A significant portion of our future cash flow will depend on the production and sale of CERs. We expect that a significant portion of our future cash flow will be generated by the production and sale of CERs. We cannot guarantee, however, that in the future we will be able to successfully sell or obtain satisfactory prices on the market for our CERs. Prices for CERs fluctuate and we have no control over such fluctuations. We are the worlds leading producer of adipic acid, which we use as a raw material for the production of Polyamide 6.6. The manufacture of adipic acid produces nitrous oxide (N2O), one of the greenhouse gases identified by the Kyoto Protocol. Within the framework of the Clean Development Mechanism established by the Kyoto Protocol, we have undertaken two projects to reduce our production of N2O, one at our Onsan (South Korea) site and another at our Paulinia (Brazil) site. The N2O emissions treatment unit at the Onsan site has been operational since September 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we received from the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) an initial allocation of 1.6 million tons of Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits, following an independent audit of our greenhouse gas reductions. At our Paulinia site, the N2O emissions treatment unit has been operational since the end of 2006, and reached its maximum efficiency during the first weeks of 2007. Due to the N2O emissions treatment units at these two sites, we expect to receive between 11 and 13 million tons of CER credits per year beginning in 2007 and through 2013. The CER credits which we have received and expect to receive have value and are marketable and /or tradeable. Markets are being formed for the trading of such credits. However, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity and price levels on such markets. These markets have been and will continue to be affected by significant uncertainties regarding the levels of supply and demand for CER credits. Potential cash flows generated by the value of our CERs could have a material impact on our financial condition. In 2006, sales of CERs amounted to €22 million. Fluctuations in the price of CER credits could affect the market value of our securities. In order to reduce the fluctuation and volatility risks associated with the emission credits market and to maximize the value of our CERs, we entered into an agreement with Société Générale Energie (a wholly owned subsidiary of Société Générale) to create a 50/50 joint venture, ORBEO, in July 2006. This joint venture will be primarily responsible for trading CERs with respect to the greenhouse gas emission reduction projects developed by us in South Korea and Brazil under the Kyoto Protocol. Each company transferred to ORBEO exclusive rights concerning its emission credits activities: for Rhodia, a certain amount of future CERS from the South Korean and Brazilian approved projects, if such CERS are so generated, and for Société Générale Energie its skill and experience in emission credits trading. ORBEO is an investment company approved by the Credit Institutions and Investment Companies Committee (CECEI). The company is active in the CER market and oversaw a part of the forward sales of our CERs. In this context, we granted to ORBEO a guarantee of up to €100 million to cover obligations of Rhodia subsidiaries arising in connection with CER forward sales to ORBEO. We have established control systems within ORBEO that are designed to limit our exposure to risks relating to our CER activity. Global risk limits are reviewed regularly by the Board of Di rectors of ORBEO, and analyzed on a monthly basis by a Risks Committee. In addition, risk managers from both partners analyze ORBEOs daily position, and report this analysis to the management of ORBEO and the management of each partner. Form 20-F 2006  Rhodia - 10 Back to Contents The results of certain of our businesses are significantly dependent on long-term contractual arrangements with customers and suppliers. The results of certain of our Enterprises depend on long-term or renewable contracts with our clients and suppliers. Although most of our major customer relationships are typically the result of multiple contractual arrangements of varying terms, in any given year certain of these contracts come up for renewal. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew these contracts on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Furthermore, in certain cases, these contractual relationships may be with a relatively limited number of customers and suppliers. In general, we are not dependent on a sole supplier for the majority of our principal materials. Nevertheless, in the case of certain key raw materials, we depend on a few significant suppliers. We have put into place security measures so as to minimize the impact of any potential decreases or interruptions in supply. See Item 4. Information About RhodiaRaw Materials, and Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects. We are involved in litigation. We are involved in litigation arising in the normal course of our business, involving primarily product liability claims, environmental claims, antitrust claims, claims by the buyers of businesses previously sold by us and civil liability compensation claims related to chemical products sold in the marketplace. We are also involved in US securities law claims and tax disputes and other disputes with governmental agencies. We believe that there is no litigation, taken individually or as a whole, which could have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, other than those detailed in Item 8. Financial InformationLegal Proceedings and Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our businesses face risks by operating as joint ventures in which we share control but do not own a controlling interest. We face risks relating to joint ventures in which we share control but do not own a controlling interest and certain of which are also large customers and/or suppliers of our products. We have included a list of the joint venture entities that fall within the scope of our consolidation in Note 35 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Under the governing or financing documents or agreements for certain of these entities, certain key matters such as new financing, capital expenditures, approval of business plans and decisions as to timing and the amount of dividend distributions require the agreement of our partners. There is a risk of disagreement or deadlock among shareholders of joint controlled entities and of decisions being made that are contrary to our interests. In addition, our investments in joint ventures, both in general and as a result of our arrangements with our joint venture partners, may expose us to requirements for additional investment or additional capital expenditure or financing requirements or obligations to buy or sell holdings. We believe, however, that these agreements contain standard clauses and conform to standard practice in international contract and commercial law. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accuratelyreport our financial results or prevent fraud. We have designed and continue to design our internal controls with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that (1) our transactions are properly authorized; (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly recorded and reported, so as to assure that our financial statements conform with applicable accounting principles. We design our internal controls through the use of internal resources, external consultants and, in certain cases, with joint venture partners. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Any failure to maintain adequate internal controls or to be able to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could increase our operating costs and materially impair our ability to operate our business. Form 20-F 2006  Rhodia - 11 Back to Contents Our business is subject to operational risks for which we may not be adequately insured. Our plants and facilities store and/or use significant quantities of potentially hazardous materials and other items, which can be dangerous if mishandled. Any damage related to our facilities or injury to employees may negatively affect our operations and may result in a decrease in revenues and additional costs to replace or repair and insure our assets, which could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. We cannot assure you that we will not incur losses beyond the limits of, or outside the coverage of, our insurance policies. From time to time, various types of insurance for companies in the chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or, in some cases, have been unavailable. We cannot assure you that in the future we will be able to maintain existing coverage or that premiums will not increase substantially. See Item 4. I nformation About RhodiaRisk Management and Insurance. Environmental Risks We are subject to continually evolving environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations expose us to significant costs. In addition, the sector in which we operate exposes us to significant potential liability with respect to the environment. We are subject to continually evolving environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations expose us to significant costs. In addition, the sector in which we operate exposes us to significant potential liability with respect to the environment. We are subject to a broad range of extensive and evolving environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which impose increasingly stringent standards on us. Such laws relate to, among other things, air emissions, waste water discharges, the use and handling of or exposure to hazardous materials, waste disposal practices, and clean-up of environmental contamination. Compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations has resulted in ongoing costs for us. We could also incur significant expenses in the event that new laws, regulations, governmental policies or local authorities were to require, in particular that certain materials, particularly, low-grade radioactive material currently stored on-site in France, be characterized as waste and necessitate transfer and disposal at specialized and regulated off-site locations. Changes in these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to modify or expand our facilities or continue production or require us to install costly pollution control equipment or incur significant expenses, including remediation costs. A failure to comply with any such law or regulation could result in material fines and criminal penalties or the imposition of other sanctions as well as third party claims. In addition, we have been and may in the future be liable under various laws, including the US Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as “Superfund”), to contribute to the costs of clean up at third‑party facilities to which we have sent waste for disposal. Under these laws, the owner or operator of contaminated properties and the generator of wastes sent to a contaminated disposal facility may be held jointly and severally liable for the remediation of such properties, regardless of fault. We operate several SEVESO installations as defined under the European Unions SEVESO Directive 82/501/EC, modified by Council Directive 96/82/CE SEVESO II, or similar installations outside of Europe, where hazardous substances such as chlorine and phosgene are present, and which can generate major risks to the health and safety of neighboring populations and to the environment. As such, we are subject to liabilities and claims relating to personal injury (including exposure to hazardous substances used, produced, disposed of by us, located in our facilities or transported on our behalf), property damage or damage to natural resources. Form 20-F 2006  Rhodia - 12 Back to Contents We also remain liable for contamination at some of our sites, that were closed or divested, where we may retain environmental liability. Many of our current, former, discontinued or sold manufacturing sites have had an extended history of industrial use. As is typical for such sites, soil and groundwater contamination has occurred in the past and might occur or be discovered at these or other sites in the future. We could be found liable or incur significant costs associated with the remediation of such sites. The discovery of new facts, events, circumstances or conditions, and other developments such as changes in the law or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could result in increased costs and liabilities, which could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. For example, the evolution of European law in the domain of ground pollution, and in particular the Texaco decision of the European Court of Justice of January 29, 2004, which seems to have ruled that all polluted soil, even if not excavated, must be treated as waste, if confirmed, may result in significant additional costs for us. Similarly, current revisions to European directives concerning waste and ground pollution, could increase liabilities for us in these areas. Likewise, in France, the implementation of two decrees in 2005 may result in new costs for us. Decree no 2005-1130 dated September 7, 2005 regarding technological risk prevention plans (TRPP) concern measures for monitoring urbanization at the most hazardous sites. Responsibility for the costs generated by such measures remains to be clarified. A TRPP should be implemented before July 31, 2008 for approximately ten of the sites that we or one of our Enterprises operate in France. Additionally, Decree no 2005-1170 dated September 13, 2005 provides for new procedures to determine whether remediation is necessary upon the closing of a site. In some cases, these procedures may result in additional remediation costs, if after an analysis of advantages and disadvantages, such steps are deemed to be economically acceptable. Compliance with laws and regulations related to environmental protection may limit our ability to modify or develop our facilities, prevent the production of certain products, require us to install anti-pollution equipment or incur significant remediation costs, including by way of fines and penalties. Our provision for environmental liabilities amounted to €207 million at December 31, 2006. Our estimated contingent liability for environmental liabilities before discounting amounted to €146 million at December 31, 2006. It mainly relates to our sites at La Rochelle and Pont de Claix (France), Silver Bow (Montana, United States) and Cubatao (Brazil) with respect to the possible obligations to store or remediate waste or materials off-site as well as possible containment of an internal landfill in France. No provision has been recognized, at December 31 , 2006 to cover these contingent liabilities in the absence of an obligation as of such date. Moreover, our industrial activities in most of the regions in which we operate are subject to first obtaining permits or licenses. The markets in which we operate are for the most part regulated, including among others: pesticides, packaging materials, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. In addition, each geographic zone or country in which we operate, namely Europe (under Council Directive 67/548/CEE of June 27, 1967 and Council Regulation 793/93 of March 23, 1993), the United States, Japan and China have specific regulations concerning chemical products. In addition, in the area of product regulation and their placement on the market, the European regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH), adopted on December 18, 2006, puts into place a European regulatory framework for the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemical products. The implementation of the REACH Regulation will have a material financial impact on us and could affect our ability to market certain of our products in Europe. In addition, we currently own or operate plants previously owned successively by Stauffer Chemicals and Rhône‑Poulenc where asbestos was used as insulation in pipes, boilers and furnaces, but not in the manufacturing of products. As a consequence, we have received a limited number of claims relating to alleged asbestos exposure. Two of our sites in France have been registered on an official list prepared by French authorities as industrial sites that previously manufactured asbestos‑containing materials, which give workers the right to claim early retirement and could give workers other rights. We cannot exclude the possibility that other sites may be included in the future. While it is not possible to determine the ultimate outcome of all claims that may be brought against us, we believe that our future risk related to asbestos exposure is limited based on available informat ion and our experience with these claims. Form 20-F 2006  Rhodia - 13 Back to Contents Risks Related to our Financial Condition and Liquidity We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. We have a substantial amount of debt. As at December 31, 2006 we had gross financial debt (non-current plus current borrowings) of €1,949 million, or €1,657 million, net of the proceeds of the disposal of our Silicones business, which we completed on January 31, 2007. For details on our gross financial debt as at December 31, 2006, please refer to “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsLiquidity and Capital Resources. Our substantial debt has had important consequences in the past and may continue to do so in the future. These consequences could include: · requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development and other purposes; · increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; and · limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate. Restrictions imposed by our credit facilities and our other outstanding indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business and to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. Our indebtedness contains clauses that oblige us to respect certain financial ratios, in particular as regards our lines of credit and other contract-based indebtedness. In the event of a deterioration of our economic or financial condition, we would not be able to guarantee our ability to comply with such ratios or other financial covenants. We believe that improved financial conditions have reduced the risk of such an occurrence. If we were unable to fulfill our obligations under these covenants or to finance our cash needs, we would have to refinance all or part of our debt. We cannot assure you that we would be able to do so. The breach of certain financial covenants could lead to the occurrence of an event of default and/or acceleration of repayment under certain of our financing agreements. In any such event, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay all of our o bligations in full. The restrictions imposed by our indebtedness could limit our operating flexibility, our ability to finance our operations in the future, and our ability to respond to industrial opportunities. Our Revolving Credit Facility, which was not drawn at December 31, 2006, and our other outstanding indebtedness, in particular, the indentures governing our existing high yield notes, contain various covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to: · borrow money; · repay in advance certain debt tranches; · pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our share capital; · make certain investments; · create or suffer to exist certain liens; · enter into sale and leaseback transactions; · engage in certain transactions with affiliates; · expand into unrelated businesses; and · consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our or their assets. In addition, most of our existing financing agreements contain cross‑default provisions and/or cross‑acceleration clauses, pursuant to which a payment default, payment acceleration or failure to respect a financial covenant under one agreement could in some cases cause a default on or acceleration of all or a significant portion of our debt. Form 20-F 2006  Rhodia - 14 Back to Contents Our public debt ratings can affect availability and cost of our debt financings. Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors, independent rating agencies, publicly rate certain of our outstanding debt instruments. These public debt ratings affect our ability to raise debt, our access to the commercial paper market, and our ability to engage in asset‑based financing. These public debt ratings also affect the cost to us and terms and conditions of debt and asset based financings. Moody’s Investors Service has attributed a rating of B1 to Rhodia (Corporate Family Rating) (under review for a possible upgrade), a rating of B2 (with a stable outlook) to our Senior Unsecured Notes and a rating of B3 (with a stable outlook) to our Senior Subordinated Notes. Standard & Poors has attributed ratings of B+ (with a positive outlook) to our long-term debt and B (with a positive outlook) to our short-term debt. A downgrading in debt ratings would affect the availability and cost of future debt financings. We have liabilities with respect to our retirement and related benefits that are not fully financed. We have obligations to our employees relating to retirement and other end-of-contract indemnities in the majority of countries in which we operate. In the United States and the United Kingdom, liabilities arise pursuant to labor agreements, pension schemes and plans and other employee benefit plans, some of which require us to maintain assets to fund our obligations. In France, retirement indemnities and related benefits arise pursuant to labor agreements, internal conventions and applicable local requirements. These obligations are funded from current cash flows, and in France there is no legal requirement to maintain separate assets to finance such obligations. As at December 31, 2006, we had defined benefit obligations of €803 million with respect to our French retirement indemnities. Our projected benefit obligations are based on certain actuarial assumptions that vary from country to country, including discount rates, long-term rates of return on invested plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels. If actual results, especially discount rates and/or rates of return on plan assets, were to differ from these assumptions, or if we were to modify our assumptions, our pension, retirement and other post-employment costs would be higher or lower. In such case, our cash flows could be unfavorably affected from the funding of these obligations. We cannot be certain that we will not be required to make cash contributions to fund our obligations in the future. Any such payments could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. With respect to our defined benefit plans as at December 31, 2006, we had defined benefit obligations of €2,520 million, and plan assets of €1,287 million. See Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our structure as a holding company could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations under our Notes. Rhodia S.A. is a holding company with limited business operations, sources of income and assets, other than the shares of its subsidiaries. The Notes are the obligations of Rhodia S.A. exclusively. Our subsidiaries do not guarantee the payment of principal or of interest on our Notes, and the Notes are therefore be structurally subordinated to the obligations of our subsidiaries as a result of our being structured as a holding company. In the event of insolvency, liquidation or other reorganization of any of our subsidiaries, our creditors (including the holders of our Notes) will not have any right to proceed against the assets of that subsidiary or to cause the liquidation or bankruptcy of such subsidiary under applicable bankruptcy laws. Creditors of such subsidiaries would be entitled to payment in full from their respective assets before we would be entitled to receive any distribution f rom such assets. Except to the extent that Rhodia may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against a subsidiary, claims of creditors of that subsidiary will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of that subsidiary over the claims of Rhodia’s creditors, including claims under our Notes. As at December 31, 2006, our subsidiaries had €445 million of gross financial debt to third parties (€169 million net). Our subsidiaries are also subject to liabilities to other creditors as a result of obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business, which liabilities are also effectively senior to our Notes. Form 20-F 2006  Rhodia - 15 Back to Contents Dividends we received from our subsidiaries amounted to €20 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition we financed the activities of our operating subsidiaries through capital contributions of €36 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. However, our subsidiaries are distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the our Notes or to make any funds available therefore, whether by dividends, interest, loans, advances or other payments. Although we have the power to control decisions to pay dividends in the subsidiaries in which we are the majority owner, the payment of dividends and the making of loans, advances and other payments to us by our subsidiaries may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions, are contingent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and are subject to v arious business and other considerations. Such limitations include financial assistance rules, corporate benefit laws and other legal restrictions that, if violated, might require the recipient to refund unlawful payments. In particular, under company law (including the French Civil Code (Code civil) and the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and similar laws in other jurisdictions) our subsidiaries are generally prohibited from paying dividends except out of profits legally available for distribution. We may enter into certain transactions that would not constitute a Change of Control under the terms of our Notes but would increase the amount of our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect the holders of our Notes. If specific events occur that fall within the definition of a Change of Control under the terms of our Notes, we are required to make an offer to purchase all outstanding our Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, on the our Notes. We could enter into various transactions, including acquisitions, refinancing, recapitalizations or other highly leveraged transactions that do not constitute a Change of Control but could nevertheless increase the amount of our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the holders of the our Notes. In such case, we would not be required to make an offer to the holders of our Notes to purchase Notes. We may not be able to repurchase our Notes upon a Change of Control. Upon the occurrence of specific Change of Control events, we are required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes. It is possible, however, that we would not have sufficient funds at the time of such Change of Control to make the required repurchase of Notes. See Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects. French insolvency laws differ from US and other insolvency laws. Rhodia S.A. is incorporated in France and, consequently, any insolvency proceeding involving Rhodia would proceed under the laws of France. In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors. A law dated July 26, 2005 reforming French insolvency proceedings was adopted by the French Parliament (Loi no. 2005-845 du 26 juillet 2005 de sauvegarde des entreprises). This law came into effect on January 1, 2006 and applies to all procedures started as at January 1, 2006. See Item 10. Additional Information for a description of French insolvency legislation, based on currently applicable law. However, any changes in law may increase uncertainty with respect to bankruptcy proceedings in France. Form 20-F 2006  Rhodia - 16 Back to Contents Market Risks Currency and interest rate fluctuations may have a material impact on our financial results. A significant portion of our assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and earnings are denominated in currencies other than the euro, mainly the US dollar, the Brazilian real and the South Korean won. The Groups consolidated financial statements and a large part of its production and costs are denominated in euros. Variations in the exchange rates of these currencies against the euro have had and will have a significant impact on our financial position and operating earnings. The senior floating rate notes we issued in October 2006, amounts we may draw under our Revolving Credit Facility and certain of our other sources of financing bear interest at a variable rate plus a margin. We have entered into interest rate hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our variable interest rate financing. Nevertheless, we do not fully hedge our interest rate exposure. As a result, increases in applicable reference interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For further discussion of these matters and the measures we have taken to seek to protect our business against these risks, see Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk and Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Risks Related to our Shares and to our ADSs You may not be able to exercise preferential subscription rights. Under French law, shareholders have preferential subscription rights (droits préférentiels de souscription) to subscribe for cash for issuances of new shares or other securities giving rights, directly or indirectly, to acquire additional shares on a pro rata basis. Shareholders may waive their preferential subscription rights specifically in respect of any offering, either individually or collectively, at an extraordinary general meeting. Preferential subscription rights, if not previously waived, are transferable during the subscription period relating to a particular offering of shares and may be quoted on the Eurolist market of Euronext Paris. US holders of shares or ADSs may not be able to exercise preferential subscription rights unless a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 is effective with respect to such rights or an exemption from the registratio n requirements thereunder is available. We intend to evaluate at the time of any rights offering the costs and potential liabilities associated with any such registration statement, as well as the indirect benefits of enabling the exercise by the holders of US of preferential subscription rights, and any other factors we consider appropriate at the time, and then to make a decision as to whether to file such a registration statement. If preferential subscription rights cannot be exercised by an ADS holder, Citibank, N.A., as depositary, will, if possible, sell such shareholders preferential subscription rights and distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the holder. If the depositary determines, in its discretion, that such rights cannot be sold, the depositary may allow such rights to lapse. In either case, ADS holders interest in us will be diluted and, if the depositary allows rights to lapse, holders of ADSs will not realize any value from the granting of preferential subscription rights. P> Holders of ADSs may be subject to additional risks related to holding ADSs rather than shares. Because holders of ADSs do not hold their shares directly, they are subject to the following additional risks: · in the event of a dividend or other distribution, if exchange rates fluctuate during any period of time when the depositary cannot convert a foreign currency into dollars, the ADS holder may lose some or all of the value of the distribution. There can be no assurances that the depositary will be able to convert any currency at a specified exchange rate or sell any property, rights, shares or other securities at a specified price, nor that any such transactions can be completed within a specified time period; · in order to vote at shareholders meetings, ADS holders must hold their ADSs on a record date fixed prior to the record date applicable to shareholders. ADS holders must therefore receive voting materials from the depositary sufficiently in advance of the meeting in order to give their voting instructions. There can be no guarantee that ADS holders will receive voting materials in time to instruct the depositary to vote. It is possible that ADS holders, or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote at all; · ADS holders may not receive copies of all reports from us or the depositary. You may have to go to the depositarys offices to inspect any reports issued; · we and the depositary may amend or terminate the deposit agreement without ADS holders consent in a manner that could prejudice ADS holders.
