ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  CONTINUED Family ownership of common equity A substantial percentage of the Companys Common Shares is held by various members of the Gorman and Rupp families and their affiliates. These family holdings do not typically trade; therefore, the Common Shares, in part because of these circumstances, generally have a history of relatively thin trading experiences on the NYSE Amex Exchange. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS The Company has not received any written comments from the Commission staff regarding its periodic or current reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 within 180 days before the end of its fiscal year to which this Form 10-K relates.
