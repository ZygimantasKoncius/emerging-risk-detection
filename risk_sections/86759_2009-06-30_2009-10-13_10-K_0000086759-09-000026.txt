Item 1A. Risk Factors. Not required for smaller reporting companies. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. The Company has one pending comment from the Staff of the Division of Corporation Finance regarding the accounting for the minority interest of Justice and the attribution of partnership losses. We believe that the restated financial information set forth in this report, and in particular Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, adequately addresses and should resolve that comment. However, the Staff reserves the right to make further comments to the Company's filings.
