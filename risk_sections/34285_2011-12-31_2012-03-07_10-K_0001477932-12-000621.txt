Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company Has No Means to Generate Revenue We have no source of revenue. Our cash balance has been diminished by general and administrative expenses. The Market For Our Stock Is Not Liquid And The Stock Price Is Subject To Volatility Our stock is quoted on the OTCQB of the OTC Marketplace under the symbol of "REAL", where low trading volume and high volatility is often experienced. While a few firms make a market in our stock, the historically low trading volume and relatively few market makers of our stock make it more likely that a severe fluctuation in volume, either up or down, will significantly impact the stock price. There can be no assurance that these market makers will continue to quote our stock and a reduction in such market makers would negatively impact trading liquidity. Further, with our constrained resources and increased cost and time associated with implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley, it may not be possible for us to remain listed on the OTC Bulletin Board in the future as a fully reporting company. Lastly, the uncertainty of the future of the Company may limit the liquidity of our stock. This and the existing limited market and volume in the trading of our stock, may result in our stockholders having difficulty selling our common stock. The trading price of our Common Stock has been, and will likely continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to possible claims arising from our asset sale, the uncertainty of the future of the Company, general market fluctuations and other events and factors, some of which may be beyond our control.
