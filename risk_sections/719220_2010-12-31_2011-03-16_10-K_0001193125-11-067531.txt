Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  continued Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited. Holders of our common stock will be entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our Board of Directors could reduce, suspend or eliminate our dividend at any time. Our ability to increase our dividend is subject to the CPP regulations described above. Any change to the dividends on our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS There were no unresolved comments received from the SEC regarding S&Ts periodic or current reports within the last 180 days prior to December 31, 2010.
