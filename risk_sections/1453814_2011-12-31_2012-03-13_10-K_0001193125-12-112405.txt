Item 1A. Risk Factors We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. The risks described below are those which we believe are the material risks we face. Any of the risk factors described below or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Business Our quarterly and annual operating results fluctuate and may continue to fluctuate in the future, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. Our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending on factors such as:  budgeting cycles of our customers;  the length of our sales cycle;  increased competition;  our ability to develop innovative products;  the timing of new product releases by us or our competitors;  market acceptance of our products;  changes in our and our competitors pricing policies;  the financial condition of our current and potential customers;  changes in the regulatory environment;  changes in operating expenses and personnel changes;  our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel;  the effect of potential acquisitions and consequent integration;  changes in our business strategy; and  general economic factors, including factors relating to disruptions in the world credit and equity markets and the related impact on our customers access to capital. 13 Table of Contents Our future growth is dependent on the successful development and introduction of new products and enhancements. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely basis, new products or product enhancements, that our new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that we will successfully manage the transition from existing technologies. Certain of these products require a higher level of sales and support expertise. The ability of our sales channel to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on our sales and financial results in future periods. Any of these scenarios may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation, or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, a significant portion of our operating expense is relatively fixed and planned expenditures are based in part on expectations regarding future revenues. Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls may decrease our gross margins and could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter. As a result, in future quarters our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which event our stock price would likely decrease. We derive a significant percentage of our revenues from a concentrated group of customers and the loss of one or more major customers could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 31%, 43% and 46% of our revenues in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2011, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues. In 2010, Johnson & Johnson, Roche and AstraZeneca accounted for approximately 11%, 11% and 10% of our total revenues, respectively. In 2009, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues during any of these periods. The loss of any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to maintain our customer relationships, and our customers may delay performance under or fail to renew their agreements with us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Any reduction in the amount of revenues that we derive from these customers, without an offsetting increase in new sales to other customers, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of these customers could also have a material adverse effect on the collectability of our accounts receivable, our liquidity and our future operating results. If our customers cancel their contracts or terminate or delay their clinical trials, we may lose or delay revenues and our business may be harmed. Certain of our customer contracts are subject to cancellation by our customers at any time with limited notice. Customers engaged in clinical trials may terminate or delay a clinical trial for various reasons, including the failure of the tested product to satisfy safety or efficacy requirements, unexpected or undesired clinical results, decisions to de-emphasize a particular product or forego a particular clinical trial, decisions to downsize clinical development programs, insufficient patient enrollment or investigator recruitment and production problems resulting in shortages of required clinical supplies. In the case of our hosted solutions, any termination or delay in the clinical trials would likely result in a consequential delay or termination in those customers service contracts. We have experienced terminations and delays of our customer service contracts in the past (although no such past terminations have had a significant impact on our results of operations) and we expect to experience additional terminations and delays in the future. The termination of a single-study arrangement could result in decreased revenues and the delay of our customers clinical trials could result in delayed professional services revenues, which could materially harm our business. 14 Table of Contents Our sales cycles for multi-study arrangements can take in excess of nine months from initial contact to contract execution, and require significant employee time and financial resources with no assurances that we will realize sales or revenues. The sales cycle for multi-study arrangements can take in excess of nine months from initial customer contact to contract execution. During this period, we may expend substantial time, effort and financial resources without realizing any revenues with respect to the potential sale. In addition, it may be difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period, as license revenues and, when applicable, related services revenues from new customers are recognized over the applicable license term, typically one to five years. If our security is breached, our business could be disrupted, our operating results could be harmed, and customers could be deterred from using our products and services. Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage, and hosting of sensitive information, including clinical data, financial information, and other sensitive information relating to our customers, company and workforce. As a result, we face some risk of a deliberate or unintentional incident involving unauthorized access to our computer systems that could result in misappropriation or loss of assets or sensitive information, data corruption, or other disruption of business operations. In light of this risk, we have devoted significant resources to protecting and maintaining the confidentiality of our information, including implementing security and privacy programs and controls, training our workforce, and implementing new technology. We have no guarantee that these programs and controls will be adequate to prevent all possible security threats. We believe that any compromise of our electronic systems, including the unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of sensitive information or a significant disruption of our computing assets and networks, would adversely affect our reputation and our ability to fulfill contractual obligations, and would require us to devote significant financial and other resources to mitigate such problems, and could increase our future cyber security costs. Moreover, unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of such sensitive information could result in contractual or other liability. In addition, any real or perceived compromise of our security or disclosure of sensitive information may result in lost revenues by deterring customers from using or purchasing our products and services in the future or prompting them to use competing service providers. Substantially all of our computer and communications hardware is located at a single facility, the failure of which would harm our business and results of operations. Substantially all of the computer hardware necessary to operate our hosting service, which is used by the majority of our customers, is located at our hosting facility in Houston, Texas. Our systems and operations could suffer damage or interruption from human error, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, terrorist attacks, acts of war and similar events, and we do not presently have hosting systems in multiple locations. The occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facility could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Although we maintain back-up facilities and disaster recovery services in the event of a system failure, these may be insufficient or fail. Any failure of our systems could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, which would harm our business and results of operations. Our business may be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. Defects or errors in our software could harm our reputation, result in significant cost to us and impair our ability to market our solutions. The software applications underlying our hosted products and services, including Medidata Rave, are inherently complex and may contain defects or errors, some of which may be material. Errors may result from our own technology or from the interface of our software with legacy systems and data, which we did not develop. The risk of errors is particularly significant when a new product is first introduced or when new versions or enhancements of existing products are released. The likelihood of errors is increased as a result of our commitment to frequent release of new products and enhancements of existing products. 15 Table of Contents We have, from time to time, found defects in our software. Although these past defects have not resulted in any litigation against us to date, we have invested significant capital, technical, managerial and other resources to investigate and correct these past defects and we have needed to divert these resources from other development efforts. In addition, material performance problems or defects in our software may arise in the future. Material defects in our software could result in a reduction in sales, delay in market acceptance of our software or credits or refunds to our customers. In addition, such defects may lead to the loss of existing customers and difficulty in attracting new customers, diversion of development resources or harm to our reputation. Correction of defects or errors could prove to be impossible or impractical. The costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors or in responding to resulting claims or liability may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results. If we are not able to reliably meet our data storage and management requirements, or if we experience any failure or interruption in the delivery of our services over the Internet, customer satisfaction and our reputation could be harmed and customer contracts may be terminated. As part of our current business model, we store and manage hundreds of terabytes of data for our customers, resulting in substantial information technology infrastructure and ongoing technological challenges, which we expect to continue to increase over time. If we do not reliably meet these data storage and management requirements, or if we experience any failure or interruption in the delivery of our services over the Internet, customer satisfaction and our reputation could be harmed and lead to reduced revenues and increased expenses. Our hosting services are subject to service level agreements and, in the event that we fail to meet guaranteed service or performance levels, we could be subject to customer credits or termination of these customer contracts. If the cost of meeting these data storage and management requirements increases, our results of operations could be harmed. We may expand our business through new acquisitions in the future. Any such acquisitions could disrupt our business, harm our financial condition and dilute current stockholders ownership interests in our company. We intend to pursue potential acquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, or products complementary to our business and periodically engage in discussions regarding such possible acquisitions. For example, we acquired Fast Track Systems, Inc., or Fast Track, in March 2008 and Clinical Force in July 2011. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including some or all of the following:  difficulties in identifying and acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses;  substantial cash expenditures;  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, some of which we may not identify at the time of acquisition;  difficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies;  diversion of managements attention away from other business concerns;  risk associated with entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience;  potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic alliances from either our current business or the target companys business; and  delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired businesses. 16 Table of Contents If we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate, and management resources and attention may be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities. An acquisition may not result in short-term or long-term benefits to us. The failure to evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments successfully or otherwise adequately address these risks could materially harm our business and financial results. We may incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business. In addition, our future success will depend in part on our ability to manage the growth anticipated with these acquisitions. Furthermore, the development or expansion of our business or any acquired business or companies may require a substantial capital investment by us. We may not have these necessary funds or they might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. We may also seek to raise funds for an acquisition by issuing equity securities or convertible debt, as a result of which our existing stockholders may be diluted or the market price of our stock may be adversely affected. Our revenues derived from international operations are subject to risk, including risks relating to unfavorable economic, political, legal, regulatory, tax, labor and trade conditions in the foreign countries in which we operate, that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Approximately 36%, 36% and 34% of our revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were derived from international operations. We expect that international customers will continue to account for a substantial percentage of our revenues. International operations are subject to inherent risks. These risks include:  the economic conditions in these various foreign countries and their trading partners, including conditions resulting from disruptions in the world credit and equity markets;  political instability;  longer payment cycles;  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and enforcement of agreements;  compliance with foreign laws;  changes in regulatory requirements;  fewer legal protections for intellectual property and contract rights;  tariffs or other trade barriers;  difficulties in obtaining export licenses;  staffing and managing foreign operations;  exposure to currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations;  transportation delays;  potentially adverse tax consequences; and  recently proposed changes to taxation of offshore earnings. Moreover, with regard to our international operations, we frequently enter into transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and we incur operating expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, approximately 5.9%, 9.8% and 8.5%, respectively, of our revenues were denominated in foreign currencies. This creates a foreign currency exchange risk for us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 17 Table of Contents We rely on third parties for our help desk support and technology partnerships, and our business may suffer if these relationships do not continue. We currently outsource our help desk support functions, which involve important direct interactions with users of our products. In the event that our vendor becomes unable or unwilling to provide these services to us, we are not equipped to provide the necessary range of help desk support and service functions to our customers. We also work with companies such as Integrated Clinical Systems, Inc. and Business Objects SA (SAP AG) to allow our EDC platform to interface with their products. If we are unable to develop and maintain effective relationships with appropriate technology partners, if companies adopt more restrictive policies with respect to, or impose unfavorable terms and conditions on, access to their products, we may not be able to continue to provide our customers with certain platform infrastructure, which could reduce our sales and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We have been, and may continue to be, subject to claims that we or our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party. Any such claims may require us to incur significant costs, to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or to develop or license substitute technology. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims that our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party. For example, we recently settled a lawsuit filed against us by Datasci. In addition, in March 2011, we were named in a separate complaint for patent infringement filed by DataTrak International, Inc. See Note 14, Commitments and ContingenciesLegal Matters, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for full descriptions. We cannot assure you that our software solutions and the technologies used in our product offerings do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future. Any future claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, even if the claim is without merit, and could distract our management from our business. Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from the claim could require us to pay substantial amounts or obtain a license to continue to use the technology that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. Any required licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we do not obtain any required licenses, we could encounter delays in product introductions if we attempt to design around the technology at issue or attempt to find another provider of suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering the applicable software solution. In addition, we generally provide in our customer agreements that we will indemnify our customers against third-party infringement claims relating to our technology provided to the customer, which could obligate us to fund significant amounts. Infringement claims asserted against us or against our customers or other third parties that we are required or otherwise agree to indemnify may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We may be unable to adequately enforce or defend our ownership and use of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Our success is heavily dependent upon our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent and unfair competition laws, as well as license and access agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, non-competition and assignment of inventions agreements. The steps we take to protect these rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology by third parties or may not be adequate under the laws of some foreign countries, which may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Our attempts to protect our intellectual property may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation, and agreement terms that address non-competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and may not be enforceable in any particular case. Moreover, the degree of future protection 18 Table of Contents of our intellectual property and proprietary rights is uncertain for products that are currently in the early stages of development because we cannot predict which of these products will ultimately reach the commercial market or whether the commercial versions of these products will incorporate proprietary technologies. In addition, there remains the possibility that others will reverse engineer our products in order to determine their method of operation and introduce competing products or that others will develop competing technology independently. If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail. The failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We could incur substantial costs resulting from product liability claims relating to our products or services or our customers use of our products or services. Any failure or errors in a customers clinical trial caused or allegedly caused by our products or services could result in a claim for substantial damages against us by our customers or the clinical trial participants, regardless of our responsibility for the failure. Although we are generally entitled to indemnification under our customer contracts against claims brought against us by third parties arising out of our customers use of our products, we might find ourselves entangled in lawsuits against us that, even if unsuccessful, may divert our resources and energy and adversely affect our business. Further, in the event we seek indemnification from a customer, a court may not enforce our indemnification right if the customer challenges it or the customer may not be able to fund any amounts for indemnification owed to us. In addition, our existing insurance coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or may not be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims, or the insurer may disclaim coverage as to any future claim. Our failure to properly protect any customer data, including personal medical information we possess or are deemed to possess in connection with the conduct of clinical trials could subject us to significant liability. Our customers use our software solutions to collect, manage and report information in connection with the conduct of clinical trials. This information may be considered our customers proprietary information or personal medical information of the clinical trial participants or patients. Regulation related to the use and disclosure of personal medical information continues to expand in scope and complexity. Increased focus on individuals rights to confidentiality of their personal information, including personal medical information, could lead to an increase of existing and future legislative or regulatory initiatives giving direct legal remedies to individuals, including rights to damages, against entities deemed responsible for not adequately securing such personal information. In addition, courts may look to regulatory standards in identifying or applying a common law theory of liability, whether or not that law affords a private right of action. Since we receive and process our customers data or personal information of clinical trial participants and patients from customers utilizing our hosted solutions, there is a risk that we could be liable if there were a breach of any obligation to a protected person under contract, standard of practice or regulatory requirement. If we fail to protect our customers data or personal information that is in our possession or deemed to be in our possession properly, we could be subjected to significant liability and our reputation would be harmed. Current and future litigation against us, which may arise in the ordinary course of our business, could be costly and time consuming to defend. We are from time to time subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes and employment claims made by our current or former employees. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the Companys business and have demanded and may in the future demand that the Company license their technology. For example, we recently settled a lawsuit filed against us by Datasci. In addition, in March 2011, we were named in a separate complaint 19 Table of Contents for patent infringement filed by DataTrak International, Inc. See Note 14, Commitments and ContingenciesLegal Matters, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for full descriptions. Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert managements attention and resources, which may seriously harm our business, overall financial condition and operating results. Insurance may not cover such claims, may not be sufficient for one or more such claims and may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, resulting in a reduction in the trading price of our stock. Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to termination rights and other risks that could adversely affect us. Because our U.S. government contracts and subcontracts are generally subject to procurement laws and regulations, we may not receive all of the future revenues we anticipate receiving under those contracts and subcontracts in the expected periods. Some of our government contracts are governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, which includes uniform policies and procedures for acquiring goods and services by the U.S. government. The FAR also contains guidelines and regulations for managing a contract after an award, including conditions under which contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, at the governments convenience. These regulations also subject us to financial audits and other reviews by the government of our costs, performance, accounting and general business practices relating to our government contracts, which may result in adjustment of our contract-related costs and fees. In December 2010, the U.S. government terminated for convenience a contract previously awarded to us on behalf of the U.S. National Institute of Healths National Cancer Institute, or NCI. Any such future procurement actions by other government customers are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could affect the allocation, timing, schedule and scope of our government contracts and subcontracts. Risks Related to Our Industry We face significant competition, which could cause us to lose business or achieve lower margins. The market for our clinical trial solutions is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements that may render existing products and services obsolete. Accordingly, our market share and margins are subject to sudden declines. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. These competitors may respond more quickly than we can to new and emerging technologies and changing customer and regulatory requirements, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their solutions. We anticipate that new competitors will enter our market in the future, as barriers to entry are relatively low in our industry. Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact our sales, gross margins or market share. In addition, current and potential competitors have established, and may in the future establish, relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies or services to increase the penetration of their products in the marketplace. Even if our products and services are more effective than the products or service offerings of our competitors, current or potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our software products, services and hosted solutions. Our failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We depend entirely on the clinical trial market, and a downturn in this market could cause our revenues to decrease. Our business depends entirely on the clinical trials conducted or sponsored by pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies, CROs and other entities. Our revenues may decline as a result of conditions affecting these industries, including general economic downturns, increased consolidation, decreased competition or fewer products under development. Other developments that may affect these industries and harm our operating results include product liability claims, changes in government regulation, changes in 20 Table of Contents governmental price controls or third-party reimbursement practices and changes in medical practices. Disruptions in the world credit and equity markets and the current global recession may also result in a global downturn in spending on research and development and clinical trials and may impact our customers access to capital and their ability to pay for our solutions. Any decrease in research and development expenditures or in the size, scope or frequency of clinical trials could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Extensive governmental regulation of the clinical trial process and our products and services could require significant compliance costs and have a material adverse effect on the demand for our solutions. The clinical trial process is subject to extensive and strict regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities worldwide. Our software products, services and hosted solutions are also subject to state, federal and foreign regulations. Demand for our solutions is largely a function of such government regulation, which is generally increasing at the state and federal levels in the United States and elsewhere, and subject to change at any time. Changes in the level of regulation, including a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures, could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our solutions. For example, proposals to place caps on drug prices could limit the profitability of existing or planned drug development programs, making investment in new drugs and therapies less attractive to pharmaceutical companies. Similarly, the requirements in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere to create a detailed registry of all clinical trials could have an impact on customers willingness to perform certain clinical studies. Likewise, a proposal for government-funded universal health care could subject expenditures for health care to governmental budget constraints and limits on spending. In addition, the uncertainty surrounding the possible adoption and impact on health care of any Good Clinical Practice reforms could cause our customers to delay planned research and development until some of these uncertainties are resolved. Until the new legislative agenda is finalized and enacted, it is not possible to determine the impact of any such changes. Modifying our software products and services to comply with changes in regulations or regulatory guidance could require us to incur substantial costs. Further, changing regulatory requirements may render our solutions obsolete or make new products or services more costly or time consuming than we currently anticipate. Failure by us, our customers, or our competitors to comply with applicable regulations could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement. If our solutions fail to comply with government regulations or guidelines, we could incur significant liability or be forced to cease offering our applicable products or services. If our solutions fail to allow our customers to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines, customers may be unwilling to use our solutions and any such non-compliance could result in the termination of or additional costs arising from contracts with our customers. Consolidation among our customers could cause us to lose customers, decrease the market for our products and result in a reduction of our revenues. Our customer base could decline because of industry consolidation, and we may not be able to expand sales of our products and services to new customers. Consolidation in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries and among CROs has accelerated in recent years, and we expect this trend to continue. In addition, new companies or organizations that result from such consolidation may decide that our products and services are no longer needed because of their own internal processes or the use of alternative systems. As these entities consolidate, competition to provide products and services to industry participants will become more intense and the importance of establishing relationships with large industry participants will become greater. These industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services. Also, if consolidation of larger current customers occurs, the combined organization may represent a larger percentage of business for us and, as a result, we are likely to rely more significantly on the combined organizations revenues to continue to achieve growth. 21 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Shares of our common stock were sold in our IPO in June 2009 at a price of $14.00 per share, and our common stock has subsequently traded as high as $27.39 and as low as $13.36 through December 31, 2011. However, an active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Market or otherwise may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including  our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions;  changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;  general economic and stock market conditions, including disruptions in the world credit and equity markets;  the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial estimates by analysts;  future sales of our common stock; and  the other factors described in these Risk Factors. In recent years, the stock market in general, and the market for Internet-related companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little to do with our performance, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price. In the past, some companies, including companies in our industry, have had volatile market prices for their securities and have had securities class action suits filed against them. The filing of a lawsuit against us, regardless of the outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources. Our actual operating results may differ significantly from guidance provided by our management. From time to time, we may release guidance in our quarterly earnings releases, quarterly earnings conference call, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represent our managements estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which includes forward-looking statements, is based on projections prepared by our management. These projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. Projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by analysts. 22 Table of Contents Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon, or otherwise consider, our guidance in making an investment decision in respect of our common stock. Any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material. Provisions of Delaware law and our organizational documents may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders may consider in their best interests, which could negatively affect our stock price. Provisions of Delaware law and our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or deterring tender offers for our common stock that other stockholders may consider in their best interests. Our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more different series with terms to be fixed by our board of directors. Stockholder approval is not necessary to issue preferred stock in this manner. Issuance of these shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult and more expensive for a person or group to acquire control of us, and could effectively be used as an anti-takeover device. Currently there are no shares of our preferred stock issued or outstanding. Our bylaws provide for an advance notice procedure for stockholders to nominate director candidates for election or to bring business before an annual meeting of stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors, and require that special meetings of stockholders be called only by our chairman of the board, chief executive officer, president or the board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the board. The anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and provisions in our organizational documents may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. As a public company, we incur significant administrative workload and expenses. As a public company with common stock listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, we must comply with various laws, regulations and requirements, including certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements, including our public company reporting requirements, continues to occupy a significant amount of the time of our board of directors and management and involves significant accounting, legal and other expenses. We have hired, and anticipate that we will continue to hire, additional accounting personnel to handle these responsibilities, which will increase our operating costs. Furthermore, these laws, regulations and requirements could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. New laws and regulations as well as changes to existing laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules adopted by the SEC and by The NASDAQ Stock Market, would likely result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements.
