BUSINESS Overview We are a leading developer, owner and operator of branded gaming facilities and related lodging and entertainment facilities in regional markets in the United States. We own and operate 15 gaming and entertainment facilities in Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Iowa, Colorado and Florida. Collectively, these properties feature approximately 15,000 slot machines and over 370 table games (including approximately 110 poker tables) over 3,000 hotel rooms and more than 40 restaurants. We also operate a harness racing track at our casino in Florida. Our portfolio of properties provides us with a diverse geographic footprint that minimizes geographically concentrated risks caused by weather, regional economic difficulties, gaming tax rates and regulations imposed by local gaming authorities. Strategic Plan Components The Isle of Capri senior management team brings over 200 collective years of gaming industry experience spanning 20 states, six foreign jurisdictions and over 75 individual gaming properties. Since joining the company in 2007, this team developed and are executing a strategic operating plan that focuses on the financial discipline and core operating principles of the company in order to increase our customer's satisfaction with our product offerings while at the same time increasing stockholder value. Our business approach is anchored by the following strategic components: Financial discipline. We utilize a disciplined approach to evaluate financial decisions with the continuing goal to improve our capital structure and financial flexibility. We have reduced our outstanding debt from approximately $1.5 billion as of April 27, 2008 to approximately $1.2 billion as of April 24, 2011, a reduction of approximately $310 million. We achieved this reduction primarily through the use of cash obtained from the settlement of our Hurricane Katrina claim and cash flows from operations. We retired $142.7 million of our 7% senior subordinated notes for $82.8 million through a tender offer in February 2009 and prepaid $35.0 million of our term loans under our credit facility in March 2009. On January 25, 2011, we continued to improve our capital structure by raising $51.2 million in net proceeds through the issuance of 5.3 million shares of our common stock. In March 2011, we issued $300 million in 7.75% senior notes and utilized the proceeds to repay borrowings under our credit facility. Also in March 2011, we entered into an amendment to our Credit Facility, which, among other things, extended the maturity of the revolving credit facility and term loan and increased flexibility in operations and capital spending. We continually seek opportunities to improve our capital structure. Focusing on core operating principles that have proven successful. Our operating focus is to deliver a superior guest experience by providing customers with the most popular gaming product in a clean, safe, friendly and fun environment. These areas have been shown through customer research to embody the attributes of a gaming entertainment experience most important to our customers in choosing which casino to visit. We emphasize, among other things, customer courtesy and we have implemented a proprietary program to measure our progress against standards for certain courteous behaviors. In addition, many of our capital and operating plans are intended to improve on guest satisfaction, including quality, accessibility and cleanliness of areas frequented by our customers, such as hotel rooms and other public areas in our hotels and casino floors. We also have implemented employee incentive programs designed to encourage employees to deliver superior customer service and courtesy. 2 Table of Contents Driving value through product offerings and branding. Our current branding strategy includes two separate brand names: Isle and Lady Luck (which we re-launched in fiscal 2009). Through comprehensive market studies and customer feedback, we have found that our brands convey excitement, entertainment, consistent high-quality service and value to our customers. We use the Isle brand primarily at properties that have a regional draw. These are generally casinos in larger markets where we have expansion potential demonstrated by either the size of the market or excess land that we control. The Isle-branded properties typically offer expanded amenities, such as hotel rooms, expanded food and beverage offerings and conference and convention capabilities. We use the Lady Luck brand for properties that predominantly draw local customers, which are typically in smaller markets with less expansion potential. The goal of the Lady Luck brand is to offer a first-class gaming experience and high quality entertainment options, featuring casual dining and popular local entertainment in a comfortable setting. We have completed the refurbishment and rebranding of three of our existing Isle properties under the Lady Luck brand: Marquette, Iowa in September 2009, Colorado Central Station in Black Hawk, Colorado in June 2009 and Caruthersville, Missouri in December 2008. Assuming economic conditions improve and capital availability is enhanced, we intend to rebrand additional properties under the Lady Luck name during the next few years. Our current expectations are that Natchez, Lula and Vicksburg, Mississippi; Lake Charles, Louisiana; Boonville, and Kansas City, Missouri will eventually be rebranded as Lady Luck casinos. We offer all customers membership in our customer loyalty program, which rewards customers with points and complimentary benefits that can be redeemed at any of our properties by using a players' club card. As a result, we have developed an extensive proprietary database that allows us to create effective targeted marketing and promotional programs, merchandise giveaways, gaming tournaments and other special events. As of April 24, 2011, our database contained approximately 1.3 million members, of whom approximately 0.5 million receive regular communications from us. We believe we effectively use our database to encourage repeat visits and increase our customers' length of stay at our properties. Aggressively pursuing prudent growth opportunities. On December 1, 2010, the Missouri Gaming Commission selected our proposed casino project in Cape Girardeau (the "Cape Girardeau Project") for prioritization for the thirteenth and final gaming license in the State of Missouri. We intend to brand this casino as an Isle property, which we expect to include approximately 1,000 slot machines, 28 table games, three restaurants, a lounge and terrace overlooking the Mississippi River and a 750-seat event center at an estimated cost of $125 million. We anticipate construction to begin in summer 2011 and casino operations to begin in the fourth calendar quarter of 2012. We also continue to seek to expand our operations through acquisitions, such as our acquisition of the Rainbow Casino located in Vicksburg, Mississippi in June 2010 for approximately $76 million. Vicksburg is located approximately one mile south of Interstate 20, the main road connecting Jackson, Mississippi to Vicksburg. The casino features 762 slot machines, 6 table games, a 224-seat Riverview Buffet, a 26-seat Crossroads Deli and 977 parking spots. Additionally, we formed Isle Gaming Management, a management and consulting division of the Company, in 2009 to leverage our experienced and respected management team and intellectual property by managing and operating casinos owned by third parties in exchange for management and other fees. The goal of Isle Gaming Management is to allow us to manage additional casino properties without requiring extensive capital investment. On April 14, 2011, the Nemacolin Woodlands Resort 3 Table of Contents ("Nemacolin") in Farmington, Pennsylvania was selected by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board for the final Category 3 resort gaming license. We had previously entered into an agreement with Nemacolin to complete the build-out of the casino space and provide management services for the casino. The casino is expected to include 600 slot machines, 28 table games, a casual dining restaurant and lounge. We will pay an annual fee to the resort owner and in return will receive a management fee equal to the EBITDA of the casino after payment of the fee to Nemacolin. We currently estimate the project cost at approximately $50 million and expect to be complete within nine months of the commencement of construction. The award of the license to Nemacolin is subject to a 30-day appeal period, which ends on June 20, 2011, and the obtainment of a management license. Finally, in September 2010, we were awarded a gaming license by Nevada's Gaming Control Board, expanding the universe of opportunities that we can ultimately pursue.

On June 13, 2011, we granted an option agreement to a third party which could result in the sale of certain assets used at our Lake Charles, Louisiana property. The option agreement expires on November 30, 2011 and is subject to a number of conditions. The transaction is also subject to regulatory and other approvals, and passage of a local referendum to relocate the vessel to a different market. If the option is exercised and the transaction closes, we would continue to operate our Lake Charles hotel and land-based operations and consolidate our gaming operations onto one gaming vessel. The Lake Charles market currently consists of two dockside gaming facilities, a Native American casino and a pari-mutuel facility/racino.

Approximately 2.6 million people reside within a 25-mile radius of our Pompano facility, which competes with four other racinos and three Native American gaming facilities in the market.

Recent Changes to Florida Gaming LawsIn April 2010, changes were made to Florida law which, among other things, lowered our state gaming tax rate from 50% to 35% effective July 1, 2010. This legislation also allows the poker operations to remain open for the same hours as the slot floor and removes the poker betting limits. The changes to Florida law were combined with the approval of a gaming compact between the State of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida. This gaming compact allows the tribe the exclusive right outside of Miami-Dade and Broward counties to operate slot machines and other similar electronic gaming devices and the right to operate live blackjack and baccarat table games for a period of five years at certain tribal gaming locations. International Operations LucayaWe operated a casino in Grand Bahama from December 2003 through November 2009, when we exited the operation.

CoventryWe operated a casino in the Coventry Convention Center from July 2007 through April 2009, when we terminated our lease and sold the casino and related assets. Marketing Our marketing programs are designed to promote our overall business strategy of providing customers with a safe, clean, friendly and fun gaming experience at each of our properties. We have developed an extensive proprietary database of customers that allows us to create effective targeted marketing and promotional programs that are designed to reward customer loyalty, attract new customers to our properties and maintain high recognition of our brands. 9 Table of Contents Specifically, our marketing programs and initiatives are tailored to support this corporate strategic plan and are generally focused on the following areas: Customer Research: Our marketing strategies have been developed and implemented to meet the needs and desires of our casino customers in each of our locations. In order to assess these needs and desires, we engage in significant customer research in each of our markets by conducting periodic surveys. Upon receipt of these surveys, we assess the attitudes of our customers and the customers of our competitors' properties towards the most important attributes of their experience in a regional and/or local gaming facility. We use the extensive information gathered from these research initiatives to make marketing, operating and development decisions that, we believe, will optimize the position of our properties relative to our competition. Branding Initiatives: Our strategic plan is designed to consolidate our property portfolio from four brands into two brands as the economy improves and we undertake significant new capital improvement programs. To date, we have begun this initiative through the re-branding of our properties in Caruthersville, Missouri, Marquette, Iowa, and the conversion of Colorado Central Station in Black Hawk, Colorado to Lady Luck-Black Hawk. As a component of these re-branding programs, we have also implemented newly-branded customer outlets, including custom restaurants and lounges that we are expanding through our portfolio to other properties. We believe, over time, this approach will allow us to more effectively align and promote our properties based upon customer needs and desires and market our properties on a consolidated basis. Furthermore, we expect our approach will streamline the costs associated with marketing our portfolio. Database Marketing: We have streamlined our database marketing initiatives across the Company in order to focus our marketing efforts on profitable customers who have demonstrated a willingness to regularly visit our properties. Specifically, we have focused on eliminating from our database customers who have historically been included in significant marketing efforts but have proven costly either as a result of excessive marketing expenditures on the part of the Company, or because these customers have become relatively dormant in terms of customer activity. Segmentation: We have compiled an extensive database of customer information over time. Among our most important marketing initiatives, we have introduced database segmentation to our properties and at the corporate level in order to adjust investment rates to a level at which we expect to meet a reasonable level of customer profit contribution. Retail Development: We believe that we must more effectively attract new, non-database customers to our properties in order to increase profitability and free cash flow. These customers are generally less expensive to attract and retain and, therefore, currently represent a significant opportunity for our operations. Employees As of April 24, 2011, we employed approximately 8,600 full and part-time people. We have a collective bargaining agreement with UNITE HERE covering approximately 400 employees at our Pompano property which expires in May 2012. We believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory. Governmental Regulations The gaming and racing industries are highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our facilities is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction where it is located. These laws, rules and regulations 10 Table of Contents generally relate to the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, food service, smoking, environmental matters, employees and employment practices, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We face significant competition from other gaming operations, including Native American gaming facilities, that could have a material adverse effect on our future operations. The gaming industry is intensely competitive, and we face a high degree of competition in the markets in which we operate. We have numerous competitors, including land-based casinos, dockside casinos, riverboat casinos, casinos located on racing, pari-mutuel operations or Native American-owned lands and video lottery and poker machines not located in casinos. Some of our competitors may have better name recognition, marketing and financial resources than we do; competitors with more financial resources may therefore be able to improve the quality of, or expand, their gaming facilities in a way that we may be unable to match. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the United States. Certain states have recently legalized, and other states are currently considering legalizing gaming. Our existing gaming facilities compete directly with other gaming properties in the states in which we operate. Our existing casinos attract a significant number of their customers from Houston, Texas; Mobile, Alabama; Kansas City, Kansas; Southern Florida; Little Rock, Arkansas; and Denver, Colorado. Legalization of gaming in jurisdictions closer to these geographic markets other than the jurisdictions in which our facilities are located would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Other jurisdictions, including states in close proximity to jurisdictions where we currently have operations, have considered and may consider legalizing casino gaming and other forms of competition. In addition, there is no limit on the number of gaming licenses that may be granted in several of the markets in which we operate. As a result, new gaming licenses could be awarded in these markets, which could allow new gaming operators to enter our markets that could have an adverse effect on our operating results. On February 17, 2011, a project was awarded a gaming license in Lake Charles, Louisiana which, if completed, will compete with our existing Lake Charles property. Our continued success depends upon drawing customers from each of these geographic markets. We expect competition to increase as new gaming operators enter our markets, existing competitors expand their operations, gaming activities expand in existing jurisdictions and gaming is legalized in new jurisdictions. We cannot predict with any certainty the effects of existing and future competition on our operating results. 11 Table of Contents We also compete with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as online computer gambling, bingo, pull tab games, card parlors, sports books, "cruise-to-nowhere" operations, pari-mutuel or telephonic betting on horse racing and dog racing, state-sponsored lotteries, jai-alai, and, in the future, may compete with gaming at other venues. In addition, we compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers. We are subject to extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities that could adversely affect us. Licensing requirements. As owners and operators of gaming and pari-mutuel wagering facilities, we are subject to extensive state and local regulation. State and local authorities require us and our subsidiaries to demonstrate suitability to obtain and retain various licenses and require that we have registrations, permits and approvals to conduct gaming operations. The regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate have very broad discretion with regard to their regulation of gaming operators, and may for a broad variety of reasons and in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend, fail to renew or revoke a license to conduct gaming operations or prevent us from owning the securities of any of our gaming subsidiaries, or prevent other persons from owning an interest in us or doing business with us. We may also be deemed responsible for the acts and conduct of our employees. Substantial fines or forfeiture of assets for violations of gaming laws or regulations may be levied against us, our subsidiaries and the persons involved, and some regulatory authorities have the ability to require us to suspend our operations. The suspension or revocation of any of our licenses or our operations or the levy on us or our subsidiaries of a substantial fine would have a material adverse effect on our business. To date, we have demonstrated suitability to obtain and have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for us to operate our existing gaming facilities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain these licenses, registrations, permits and approvals or that we will be able to obtain any new ones in order to expand our business, or that our attempts to do so will be timely. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals or approvals. In addition, regulatory authorities in certain jurisdictions must approve, in advance, any restrictions on transfers of, agreements not to encumber or pledges of equity securities issued by a corporation that is registered as an intermediary company with such state, or that holds a gaming license. If these restrictions are not approved in advance, they will be invalid. Compliance with other laws. We are also subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances that apply to non-gaming businesses, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages. Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on us or the results of our operations. However, several of our properties are located in industrial areas or were used for industrial purposes for many years. As a consequence, it is possible that historical or neighboring activities have affected one or more of our properties and that, as a result, environmental issues could arise in the future, the precise nature of which we cannot now predict. The coverage and attendant compliance costs associated with these laws, regulations and ordinances may result in future additional costs. 12 Table of Contents Regulations adopted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Treasury Department require us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the patron by name and social security number. U.S. Treasury Department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000 if we know, suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements. Substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with these regulations. Several of our riverboats must comply with U.S. Coast Guard requirements as to boat design, on-board facilities, equipment, personnel and safety and must hold U.S. Coast Guard Certificates of Documentation and Inspection. The U.S. Coast Guard requirements also set limits on the operation of the riverboats and mandate licensing of certain personnel involved with the operation of the riverboats. Loss of a riverboat's Certificate of Documentation and Inspection could preclude its use as a riverboat casino. The U.S. Coast Guard has shifted inspection duties related to permanently moored casino vessels to the individual states. Louisiana and Missouri have elected to utilize the services of the American Bureau of Shipping to undertake the inspections. Iowa has elected to handle the inspections through the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. The states will continue the same inspection criteria as the U.S. Coast Guard in regard to annual and five year inspections. Depending on the outcome of these inspections a vessel could become subject to dry-docking for inspection of its hull, which could result in a temporary loss of service. We are required to have third parties periodically inspect and certify all of our casino barges for stability and single compartment flooding integrity. Our casino barges and other facilities must also meet local fire safety standards. We would incur additional costs if any of our gaming facilities were not in compliance with one or more of these regulations. Potential changes in legislation and regulation of our operations. From time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, from time to time, certain anti-gaming groups have challenged constitutional amendments or legislation that would limit our ability to continue to operate in those jurisdictions in which these constitutional amendments or legislation have been adopted. Taxation and fees. State and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities. We believe that the prospect of significant revenue is one of the primary reasons that jurisdictions permit legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, local and provincial income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time to time, federal, state, local and provincial legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results. Our business may be adversely affected by legislation prohibiting tobacco smoking. Legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has recently been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions, including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate. If additional restrictions on smoking are enacted in jurisdictions in which we operate, we could experience a significant decrease in gaming revenue and particularly, if such restrictions are not applicable to all competitive facilities in that gaming market, our business could be materially adversely affected. 13 Table of Contents Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and restrict our operations. We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of April 24, 2011, we had approximately $1.2 billion of total debt outstanding. Our significant indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial health, such as: limiting our ability to use operating cash flow or obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion and other important areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness; causing an event of default if we fail to satisfy the financial and restrictive covenants contained in the indenture and agreements governing our senior secured credit facility, our 7.75% senior notes due 2019, our 7% senior subordinated notes due 2014 and our other indebtedness, which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable, could permit our secured lenders to foreclose on the assets securing our secured debt and have other adverse consequences, any of which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us; if the indebtedness under our 7.75% senior notes, our 7% senior subordinated notes, our senior secured credit facility, or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full; placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors who are not as highly leveraged; increasing our vulnerability to and limiting our ability to react to changing market conditions, changes in our industry and economic downturns or downturns in our business; and our agreements governing our indebtedness, among other things, require us to maintain certain specified financial ratios and to meet certain financial tests. Our debt agreements also limit our ability to: i.borrow money; ii.make capital expenditures; iii.use assets as security in other transactions; iv.make restricted payments or restricted investments; v.incur contingent obligations; and vi.sell assets and enter into leases and transactions with affiliates. A substantial portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates, although we have entered into interest rate protection agreements expiring through fiscal 2014 with counterparty banks with respect to $320 million of our term loans under our senior secured credit facility. If short-term interest rates rise, our interest cost will increase on the unhedged portion of our variable rate indebtedness, which will adversely affect our results of operations and available cash. Any of the factors listed above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow, or that future available draws under our senior secured credit facility will be sufficient, to enable us to meet our liquidity needs, including those needed to service our indebtedness. 14 Table of Contents Despite our significant indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly more debt. This could intensify the risks described above. The terms of the indenture and agreements governing our senior secured credit facility, our 7.75% senior notes, our 7% senior subordinated notes and our other indebtedness limit, but do not prohibit, us or our subsidiaries from incurring significant additional indebtedness in the future. As of April 24, 2011, we had the capacity to incur additional indebtedness, including the ability to incur additional indebtedness under all of our lines of credit, of approximately $175 million. Approximately $23 million of these lines of credit were used to support letters of credit and surety bonds. Our capacity to issue additional indebtedness is subject to the limitations imposed by the covenants in our senior secured credit facility, the indenture governing our 7.75% senior notes and the indenture governing our 7% senior subordinated notes. The indenture governing our 7% senior subordinated notes, the indenture governing our 7.75% senior notes and our senior secured credit facility contain financial and other restrictive covenants, but will not fully prohibit us from incurring additional debt. If new debt is added to our current level of indebtedness, the related risks that we now face could intensify. If we cannot refinance our 7% senior subordinated notes on or prior to November 1, 2013, then our senior secured credit facility matures on that date and we may not be able to renew or extend our senior secured credit facility or enter into a new credit facility in today's difficult markets. If we are able to refinance our 7% senior subordinated notes or, in the alternative, renew or extend our senior secured credit facility, it may be on terms substantially less favorable than the current notes or senior secured credit facility. Our senior secured credit facility matures on November 1, 2013 if we have not refinanced or otherwise retired the 7% senior subordinated notes on or prior to such date. Our cash flow from operations is unlikely to be sufficient to retire all of such notes at or prior to November 1, 2013. We may therefore be forced to refinance the 7% senior subordinated notes on materially worse terms than we have currently. Failure to obtain new debt on favorable or reasonable terms to replace existing debt could affect our liquidity and the value of our other securities, including our equity. Our ability to refinance or otherwise retire our 7% senior subordinated notes prior to November 1, 2013, or in the alternative to renew or extend our existing senior secured credit facility or to enter into a new credit facility to replace the existing senior secured credit facility could be impaired if market conditions worsen. In the current environment, lenders may seek more restrictive lending provisions and higher interest rates that may reduce our borrowing capacity and increase our costs. We can make no assurances that we will be able to refinance or otherwise retire our 7% senior subordinated notes prior to November 1, 2013, and if we are unable to do so, that we will be able to enter into a new credit facility or renew or extend our existing senior secured credit facility, or whether any such credit facility will be available under acceptable terms. Failure to obtain sufficient financing or financing on acceptable terms would constrain our ability to operate our business and to continue our development and expansion projects. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to successfully expand to new locations or recover our investment in new properties which would adversely affect our operations and available resources. We regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets, through acquiring or managing other gaming entertainment facilities or through redeveloping our existing facilities. The expansion of our operations, whether through acquisitions, development, management contracts or internal growth, could divert management's attention and could also cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal, professional and consulting 15 Table of Contents fees. To the extent that we elect to pursue any new gaming acquisition, management or development opportunity, our ability to benefit from our investment will depend on many factors, including: our ability to successfully identify attractive acquisition and development opportunities; our ability to successfully operate any developed, managed or acquired properties; our ability to attract and retain competent management and employees for the new locations; our ability to secure required federal, state and local licenses, permits and approvals, which in some jurisdictions are limited in number and subject to intense competition; and the availability of adequate financing on acceptable terms. Many of these factors are beyond our control. There have been significant disruptions in the global capital markets that have adversely impacted the ability of borrowers to access capital. Accordingly, it is likely that we are dependent on free cash flow from operations and remaining borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility to implement our near-term expansion plans and fund our planned capital expenditures. As a result of these and other considerations, we cannot be sure that we will be able to recover our investments in any new gaming development or management opportunities or acquired facilities, or successfully expand to additional locations. We may experience construction delays during our expansion or development projects that could adversely affect our operations. From time to time we may commence construction projects at our properties. We also evaluate other expansion opportunities as they become available and we may in the future engage in additional construction projects. On December 1, 2010, the Missouri Gaming Commission selected our proposed Cape Girardeau Project for prioritization for the 13th and final gaming license in the State of Missouri. The Cape Girardeau Project is expected to include approximately 1,000 slot machines, 28 table games, 3 restaurants, a lounge and terrace overlooking the Mississippi River and a 750-seat event center at an estimated cost of $125 million. On April 14, 2011, our project at the Nemacolin Woodlands Resort was selected by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board for the final Category 3 resort gaming license. We had previously entered into an agreement with Nemacolin to complete the build-out of the casino space and provide management services to the casino. The Nemacolin project is expected to include 600 slot machines, 28 table games, a casual dining restaurant and lounge. We currently estimate the project cost at approximately $50 million and expect to be complete within nine months of the commencement of construction. The anticipated costs and construction periods for the Cape Girardeau Project, the Nemacolin Project and other projects are based upon budgets, conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects. Construction projects entail significant risks, which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project. Such risks include shortages of materials or skilled labor, unforeseen engineering, environmental or geological problems, work stoppages, weather interference and unanticipated cost increases. Most of these factors are beyond our control. In addition, difficulties or delays in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, permits or authorizations from regulatory authorities can increase the cost or delay the completion of an expansion or development. Significant budget overruns or delays with respect to expansion and development projects could adversely affect our results of operations. If we construct the Cape Girardeau Project and we are not granted gaming licenses, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected. On December 1, 2010, the Missouri Gaming Commission selected our proposed Cape Girardeau Project for prioritization for the 13th and final gaming license in the State of Missouri. As a participant in this process, our subsidiary IOC-Cape Girardeau LLC applied for a Class B Riverboat Gaming License in Missouri. The decision by the Missouri Gaming Commission to prioritize its casino 16 Table of Contents development does not provide IOC-Cape Girardeau LLC with any license to open the casino once developed or any assurance that such a license will be granted. The Class B license required for IOC-Cape Girardeau LLC to operate its proposed gaming facility cannot be granted by the Missouri Gaming Commission until the gaming facility development is substantially complete and ready to accept patrons. The grant of this license would be subject to numerous conditions as described in "Description of Government RegulationsMissouri" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 24, 2011. If, as a result of these regulatory conditions or otherwise, we are unable to receive the gaming license after we construct the Cape Girardeau Project, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected. If we are not licensed in Pennsylvania in connection with the proposed resort casino at Nemacolin Woodlands Resort or if our management agreement is not approved in its current form or if either of these matters are materially delayed, we may not manage the casino or the terms upon which we manage may be less favorable to us. On April 14, 2011, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (the "PGCB") awarded a Category 3 slot machine license to Woodlands Fayette, LLC for a resort casino at the Nemacolin Woodlands Resort in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. Although we have a management agreement with Woodlands Fayette to manage the proposed casino, we have not yet been licensed by the PGCB in connection with the casino project, nor has the management agreement been approved by the PGCB. There is no guaranty that we will be approved or that the management agreement will be approved in its current form. Further, the award of the license to Woodlands Fayette is subject to a 30-day appeal period which ends on June 20, 2011. Any such appeals would be made directly to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and could take a significant period of time before a ruling is made by the court. If such an appeal is filed, it is possible that the PGCB will refrain from most, if not all, rulings regarding the casino project during the pendency of such appeal, including our licensure and approval of the management agreement. If our key personnel leave us, our business could be adversely affected. Our continued success will depend, among other things, on the efforts and skills of a few key executive officers and the experience of our property managers. Our ability to retain key personnel is affected by the competitiveness of our compensation packages and the other terms and conditions of employment, our continued ability to compete effectively against other gaming companies and our growth prospects. The loss of the services of any of these key individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not maintain "key man" life insurance for any of our employees. We are effectively controlled by members of the Goldstein Family and their decisions may differ from those that may be made by other stockholders. Robert S. Goldstein, our Vice Chairman of the Board, and Jeffrey D. Goldstein and Richard A. Goldstein, two of our directors, and various family trusts associated with members of the Goldstein family and entities associated with certain members of the Goldstein family, (collectively the "Goldstein Parties") directly and indirectly collectively own and control approximately 42.6% of our common stock as of April 24, 2011. The Goldstein Parties have substantial control over the election of our board of directors and the outcome of the vote on substantially all other matters, including amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amendment of our by-laws and significant corporate transactions, such as the approval of a merger or other transactions involving a sale of the Company. Such substantial control may have the effect of discouraging transactions involving an actual or potential change of control, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our 17 Table of Contents common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of common stock. The interests of the Goldstein Parties may differ from those of our other stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that could delay and discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable. Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may make it more difficult or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us, including: we may not, until the Supermajority Expiration Time (as defined below), without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662/3% of the Company's voting power, voting as a single class, authorize, adopt or approve certain extraordinary corporate transactions; and the classification of our board of directors and staggered three-year terms of service for each class of directors. "Supermajority Expiration Time" means the first to occur of (i) the Goldstein Group ceasing to hold common stock of the Company representing at least 22.5% of our outstanding common stock, not including any shares of Class B common stock or shares of common stock issued upon conversion of any preferred stock and (ii) April 8, 2021. The "Goldstein Group" means Robert S. Goldstein, our Vice Chairman, and Jeffrey D. Goldstein and Richard A. Goldstein, two of our directors, spouses, children and grandchildren of certain members of the Goldstein family and entities associated with certain members of the Goldstein family. These provisions may make mergers, acquisitions, tender offers, the removal of management and certain other transactions more difficult or more costly and could discourage or limit stockholder participation in such types of transactions, whether or not such transactions are favored by the stockholders. The provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Further, the existence of these anti-takeover measures may cause potential bidders to look elsewhere, rather than initiating acquisition discussions with us. Any of these factors could reduce the price of our common stock. We have a history of fluctuations in our operating income (losses) from continuing operations, and we may incur additional operating losses from continuing operations in the future. Our operating results could fluctuate significantly on a periodic basis. We earned income from continuing operations of $1.1 million in fiscal 2011 and sustained a (loss) from continuing operations of $(1.5) million in fiscal 2010. Companies with fluctuations in income (loss) from continuing operations often find it more challenging to raise capital to finance improvements in their businesses and to undertake other activities that return value to their stockholders. In addition, companies with operating results that fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis experience increased volatility in their stock prices in addition to difficulties in raising capital. We cannot assure you that we will not have fluctuations in our income (losses) from continuing operations in the future, and should that occur, that we would not suffer adverse consequences to our business as a result, which could decrease the value of our common stock. Inclement weather and other conditions could seriously disrupt our business and have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The operations of our facilities are subject to disruptions or reduced patronage as a result of severe weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualties. Because many of our gaming operations are located on or adjacent to bodies of water, these facilities are subject to risks in addition to those associated with other casinos, including loss of service due to casualty, forces of nature, 18 Table of Contents mechanical failure, extended or extraordinary maintenance, flood, hurricane or other severe weather conditions and other disasters. In addition, severe weather such as high winds and blizzards occasionally limits access to our land-based facilities in Colorado. We cannot be sure that the proceeds from any future insurance claim will be sufficient to compensate us if one or more of our casinos experience a closure. Reductions in discretionary consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the economic recession currently being experienced in the United States, as we are highly dependent on discretionary spending by our patrons. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as increased unemployment, significant increases in energy prices, perceived or actual deterioration in general economic conditions, the current housing market crisis, bank failures and the potential for additional bank failures, perceived or actual decline in disposable consumer income and wealth, the current global economic recession and changes in consumer confidence in the economy may continue to reduce customer demand for the leisure activities we offer and may adversely affect our revenues and operating cash flow. We are not able to predict the length or severity of the current economic circumstances. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. The market price of our common stock has historically been volatile and may continue to fluctuate substantially due to a number of factors, including actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations, the announcement of significant transactions or other agreements by our competitors, conditions or trends in the our industry or other entertainment industries with which we compete, general economic conditions including those affecting our customers' discretionary spending, changes in the cost of air travel or the cost of gasoline, changes in the gaming markets in which we operate and changes in the trading value of our common stock. The stock market in general, as well as stocks in the gaming sector have been subject to significant volatility and extreme price fluctuations that have sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to individual companies' operating performances. Broad market or industry factors may harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Work stoppages, organizing drives and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits. Some of our employees are currently represented by a labor union or have begun organizing a drive for labor union representation. Labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit more employees in the gaming industry. In addition, organized labor may benefit from new legislation or legal interpretations by the current presidential administration. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional or more successful union activity in the future. Additionally, lengthy strikes or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties or construction projects could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operations. We are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our financial condition. From time to time, we are defendants in various lawsuits and gaming regulatory proceedings relating to matters incidental to our business. As with all litigation, no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these matters and, in general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal proceedings, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 19 Table of Contents Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer. In addition, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain the same insurance coverage in the future. We may suffer damage to our property caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism), that could severely disrupt our business or subject us to claims by third parties who are injured or harmed. Although we maintain insurance customary in our industry, (including property, casualty, terrorism and business interruption insurance) that insurance may not be adequate or available to cover all the risks to which our business and assets may be subject. The lack of sufficient insurance for these types of acts could expose us to heavy losses if any damages occur, directly or indirectly, that could have a significant adverse impact on our operations. We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage. Among other factors, it is possible that regional political tensions, homeland security concerns, other catastrophic events or any change in government legislation governing insurance coverage for acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage (which may cause us to elect to reduce our policy limits), additional exclusions from coverage or higher deductibles. Among other potential future adverse changes, in the future we may elect to not, or may not be able to, obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism. The concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us. A large majority of our revenues are attributable to slot machines at our casinos. It is important, for competitive reasons, we offer the most popular and up-to-date slot machine games, with the latest technology to our customers. In recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements. Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long-term than the cost to purchase a new slot machine. For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines, slot machine systems, or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than our current costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines. If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment and participating lease costs, it could adversely affect our profitability. * * * * * * * In addition to the foregoing, you should consider each of the factors set forth in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects. The factors described in our Part 1, Item 1A are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. This Annual Report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the foregoing risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially harmed. In that case, the trading price of our securities, including our common stock, could decline significantly. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 20 Table of Contents
