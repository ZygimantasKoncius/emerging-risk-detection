Risk factors  Risks related to our business". Competition from producers of generics has increased sharply in response to healthcare cost containment measures and to the increased number of products for which patents or regulatory exclusivity have expired. Generics manufacturers who have received all necessary regulatory approvals for a product may decide to launch a generic version before the patent expiry date. Such launch may occur notwithstanding the fact that the owner of the original product may already have commenced patent infringement litigation against the generics manufacturer. Such launches are said to be "at risk" for the promoter of the generic product because it may be required to pay damages to the owner of the original product in the context of patent infringement litigation; however, these launches may also significantly impair the profitability of the pharmaceutical company whose product is challenged. 72 Drug manufacturers also face competition through parallel trading, also known as reimportation. This takes place when drugs sold abroad under the same brand name as in a domestic market are imported into that domestic market by parallel traders, who may repackage or resize the original product or sell it through alternative channels such as mail order or the Internet. This situation is of particular relevance to the European Union, where these practices have been encouraged by the current regulatory framework. Parallel traders take advantage of the price differentials between markets arising from factors including sales costs, market conditions (such as intermediate trading stages), tax rates, or national regulation of prices. Finally, pharmaceutical companies face illegal competition from counterfeit drugs. The WHO estimates that counterfeit products account for 10% of the market worldwide, rising to more than 30% in some countries. However, in markets where powerful regulatory controls are in place, counterfeit drugs are estimated to represent less than 1% of market value. The WHO also estimates that 50% of drugs sold on illegal websites have been found to be counterfeit. A counterfeit medicine is deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled with respect to its identity and/or its source. Counterfeiting can apply to both branded and generic products, and counterfeit products may include products with the correct ingredients or with the wrong ingredients, without active ingredients, with insufficient active ingredients, or with fake packaging. Sanofi acts ethically and responsibly to protect patient health worldwide. We become involved in any efforts made to overcome drug counterfeiting and have implemented the following actions: Ever closer collaboration with international organizations and with customs and police to reinforce regulatory frameworks (Medicrime Convention, European Directive on Falsified Medicines, etc.), to investigate suspected counterfeiters and to deliver information and educational programs to raise awareness about the risk related to falsified medicines; Centralization and analysis in a specialized laboratory of all suspect Sanofi drugs, to detect falsified medicines and inform health and enforcement authorities; and Development of technologies to make drugs more difficult to copy through packaging protection programs and traceability programs. Regulatory Framework The pharmaceutical and health-related biotechnology sectors are highly regulated. National and supranational health authorities administer a vast array of legal and regulatory requirements that dictate pre-approval testing and quality standards to maximize the safety and efficacy of a new medical product. These authorities also regulate product labeling, manufacturing, importation/exportation and marketing, as well as mandatory post-approval commitments that may include pediatric development. The submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that a license to market will be granted. Furthermore, each regulatory authority may impose its own requirements during the course of the product development and application review. It may refuse to grant approval and require additional data before granting approval, even though the same product has already been approved in other countries. Regulatory authorities also have the authority to request product recalls, product withdrawals and penalties for violations of regulations based on data that are made available to them. Product approval can vary from six months or less to several years from the date of application depending upon the country. Factors such as the quality of data submitted, the degree of control exercised by the regulatory authority, the review procedures, the nature of the product and the condition to be treated, play a major role in the length of time a product is under review. In recent years, efforts have been made by the ICH (International Conference on Harmonization) participants to harmonize product development and regulatory submission requirements. The ICH consists of the regulatory agencies of the three founding members (European Union, Japan, United States), plus Health Canada and 73 Swissmedic as observers. An example of these efforts is the Common Technical Document (CTD), which can be used in different ICH regions for a product application review, with only local or regional adaptation. Electronic CTD is becoming the standard for worldwide product submission. Interestingly, emerging countries are starting to participate in ICH standardization discussions, and could be more involved in the near future. International collaboration between regulatory authorities continues to develop with implementation of confidentiality arrangements between ICH regulatory authorities, and with non-ICH regulatory authorities. Examples include work-sharing on Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and Good Clinical Practices (GCP) inspections and regular interactions in the form of "clusters" (i.e. pediatrics, oncology, advanced therapy medicinal products, vaccines, pharmacogenomics, orphans, biosimilars, blood products) between the United States and the European Union. Other initiatives include the presence of permanent representatives from the FDA and the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in London, and a corresponding permanent representative from EMA at the FDA. The requirement of many countries, including Japan and several member states of the European Union, to negotiate selling prices or reimbursement rates for pharmaceutical products with government regulators significantly extends the time for market entry beyond the initial marketing approval. While marketing approvals for new pharmaceutical products in the European Union have been largely centralized with the EMA, pricing and reimbursement remain a matter of national competence. In the European Union, there are three main procedures by which to apply for marketing authorization: The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of medicinal products. When an application is submitted to the EMA, the scientific evaluation of the application is carried out by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and a scientific opinion is prepared. This opinion is sent to the European Commission which adopts the final decision and grants an E.U. marketing authorization. Such a marketing authorization is valid throughout the E.U. and the drug may be marketed within all E.U. member states. If a company is seeking a national marketing authorization in more than one member state, the mutual recognition or decentralized procedure is available to facilitate the granting of harmonized national authorizations across member states. Both the decentralized and the mutual recognition procedures are based on the recognition by national competent authorities of a first assessment performed by the regulatory authority of one member state. National authorizations are still possible, but are only for products intended for commercialization in a single E.U. member state or for line extensions to existing national product licenses. Generic products are subject to the same marketing authorization procedures. A generic product must contain the same active medicinal substance as a reference product approved in the E.U. Generic applications are abridged: generic manufacturers only need to submit quality data and demonstrate that the generic drug is "bioequivalent" to the originator product (i.e., works in the same way in the patient's body), but do not need to submit safety or efficacy data since regulatory authorities can refer to the reference product's dossier. Generic product applications can be filed and approved in the European Union only after the originator product eight year data exclusivity period has expired. Further, generic manufacturers can only market their generic products after a 10- or 11-year period has elapsed from the date of approval of the originator product has elapsed. Another relevant aspect in the E.U. regulatory framework is the "sunset clause": a provision leading to the cessation of the validity of any marketing authorization if it is not followed by marketing within three years or, if marketing is interrupted for a period of three consecutive years. Post-authorization safety monitoring of pharmaceutical products is carefully regulated in Europe. The E.U. pharmaceutical legislation for medicinal products describes the respective obligations of the marketing authorization holder and of the regulatory authorities to set up a system for pharmacovigilance in order to collect, collate and evaluate information about suspected adverse reactions. 74 It is possible for the regulatory authorities to withdraw products from the market for safety reasons. Responsibilities for pharmacovigilance rest with the regulatory authorities of all the E.U. member states in which the marketing authorizations are held. In accordance with applicable legislation, each E.U. member state has a pharmacovigilance system for the collection and evaluation of information relevant to the benefit to risk balance of medicinal products. The regulatory authority regularly monitors the safety profile of the products available on its territory and takes appropriate action where necessary and monitors the compliance of marketing authorization holders with their obligations with respect to pharmacovigilance. All relevant information is shared between the regulatory authorities and the marketing authorization holder, in order to allow all parties involved in pharmacovigilance activities to fulfill their obligations and responsibilities. In 2010, new legislation aimed at improving patient protection by strengthening the E.U. system for the safety monitoring of medicines was approved. In July 2012, Pharmacovigilance legislation came into force, with significant impacts on the regulatory environment. Changes include the creation of a new scientific advisory committee, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) at EMA level, with a key role in recommendation/advice on product safety issues. This committee, which includes a patient representative, can hold public hearings. Since its introduction in the second quarter of 2012 the PRAC has initiated reviews of products with subsequent regulatory actions leading to harmonization of the labeling. For instance several Sanofi products including zolpidem, clopidogrel, and insulin glargine are currently under review. The Pharmacovigilance legislation also strengthens the legal basis for regulators to require post-authorization safety and efficacy studies throughout the life cycle of a medicinal product, with regulatory supervision of protocols and results. Such studies are aimed at collecting data to enable the safety or efficacy of medicinal products to be assessed in everyday medical practice. The granting of marketing authorization will be conditional on such studies being performed. Consequently, the pharmaceutical industry will have to build the need for post-authorization safety studies (PASS) and post-authorization efficacy studies (PAES) into development and life cycle management plans. As of today, no PASS or PAES has been requested to Sanofi. The Pharmacovigilance legislation also introduces a new periodic safety report prepared by the companies. This is no longer limited to safety data, but instead presents a critical analysis of the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product, taking into account new or emerging information in the context of cumulative information on risks and benefits. In the United States, applications for approval are submitted for review to the FDA, which has broad regulatory powers over all pharmaceutical and biological products that are intended for sale and marketing in the U.S. To commercialize a product in the U.S., a New Drug Application (NDA) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act or Biological License Application (BLA) under the Public Health Service (PHS) Act is submitted to the FDA with data for filing and pre-market review. Specifically, the FDA must decide whether the product is safe and effective for its proposed use, if the benefits of the drug's use outweigh its risks, whether the drug's labeling is adequate, and if the manufacturing of the drug and the controls used for maintaining quality are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity. Based upon this review, the FDA can require post-approval commitments and requirements. Approval for a new indication of a previously approved product requires the submission of a supplemental NDA (sNDA) for a drug or supplemental BLA (sBLA) for a biological product. The FD&C Act provides another abbreviated option for NDA approved products, called the 505(b)(2) pathway. This pre-market application may rely on the FDA finding that the reference product has been found to be safe and effective by the FDA based upon the innovator's preclinical and clinical data. Sponsors wishing to market a generic drug can file an Abbreviated NDA (ANDA) under 505(j) of the FD&C Act. These applications are "abbreviated" because they are generally not required to include data to establish safety and effectiveness, but need only demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent (i.e., performs in humans in the same manner as the originator's product). Consequently, the length of time and cost required for development of generics can be considerably less than for the originator's drug. With effect from October 1, 2012 (FDASIA  GDUFA), an application for a generic drug product requires a user fee payment. User fees for generic drug applications are necessary to help alleviate the backlog of applications at the Office of Generics Drugs (OGD). The 75 current review time for an ANDA exceeds 30 months. The ANDA pathway in the United States can only be used for generics of drugs approved under the FD&C Act. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010, amends the Public Health Service Act to create an abbreviated licensure pathway (351k) for biological products that are demonstrated to be "biosimilar" to or "interchangeable" with an FDA-licensed biological product. As of January 1, 2013, no sponsor has submitted a 351k application to the FDA for review. On July 9, 2012, President Obama signed into law the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), which primarily amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and Public Health Service Act. In addition to reauthorizing and amending several drug and medical device provisions that were scheduled to expire, the new law establishes new user fee statutes for generic drugs and biosimilars. FDASIA also provides the FDA with tools intended to expedite the development and review of innovative new medicines that address certain unmet medical needs, and with new authority concerning drug shortages, among other things. The law significantly changes the FDC Act and the PHS Act in several respects that will have considerable short- and long-term effects on the regulated industry. FDASIA includes 11 titles, the first five of which concern drug and medical device user fee and pediatric-related programs. FDASIA § 501 makes permanent both the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and Pediatric Research Equity Act by eliminating the "sunset" provision of the BPCA and a related PREA provision. Title VI includes changes to the law styled as medical device regulatory improvements. Title VII makes significant changes to enhance the FDA's inspection authority and the drug supply chain. Title VIII creates incentives to encourage the development of products for antibiotic-resistant infections. Title IX expands the scope of products that qualify for accelerated approval and creates a new "breakthrough therapy" program, among other things. Title X is intended to legislatively address the current drug shortage crisis. Finally, Title XI reauthorizes certain provisions created by the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, provides for the regulation of medical gases, and includes several miscellaneous provisions, such as provisions on prescription drug abuse, 180-day generic drug marketing exclusivity, citizen petitions, controlled substances, and nanotechnology to name a few. In Japan, regulatory authorities can require local development studies, though they also accept multi-national studies. They can also request bridging studies to verify that foreign clinical data are applicable to Japanese patients and require data to determine the appropriateness of the dosages for Japanese patients. These additional procedures have created a significant delay in the registration of some innovative products in Japan compared to the European Union and the United States. In order to solve this drug-lag problem, the MHLW (Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare) introduced the new NHI (National Health Insurance) pricing system on a trial basis. Reductions in NHI prices of new drugs every two years are compensated by a "Premium" for a maximum of 15 years. A "Premium" is granted in exchange for the development of unproved drugs/off-label indications with high medical needs. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to conduct literatures-based submission within six months or start a clinical trial for registration within one year after the official request. Otherwise, NHI prices of all products of the manufacturer would be reduced dramatically. In addition, the regulatory authorities have begun to promote multinational studies. For new drugs and biosimilar products with approval applications submitted on or after April 2013, Japan will begin implementing a "Risk management plan", similar to the E.U. Pharmacogivilance system. For generic products, the data necessary for filing are similar to E.U. and U.S. requirements. Pharmaceutical companies only need to submit quality data, and data demonstrating bioequivalence to the originator product, unless the drug is administered intravenously. Focus on Biologics Products can be referred to as "biologics" when they are derived from plant or animal tissues, including blood products or products manufactured within living cells (e.g., antibodies). Most biologics are complex molecules or mixtures of molecules which are difficult to characterize and require physico-chemical-biological testing, and an understanding of and control over the manufacturing process. 76 The concept of "generics" is not scientifically appropriate for biologics due to their high level of complexity and therefore the concept of "biosimilar" products is more appropriate. A full comparison of the purity, safety and efficacy of the biosimilar product against the reference biological product should be undertaken, including assessment of physical/chemical, biological, non-clinical and clinical similarity. In the European Union, a regulatory framework for developing and evaluating biosimilar products has been in place since November 2005. The CHMP has issued several product/disease specific guidelines for biosimilar products including guidance on preclinical and clinical development of biosimilars of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). However, starting in 2011 and continuing in 2012, the EMA has initiated a revision of the majority of the existing biosimilar guidelines (general guidelines, as well as immunogenicity and product-related guidelines for recombinant insulin and LMWH). Two new guidelines on monoclonal antibodies and immunogenicity of monoclonal antibodies have also been issued; other product-related guidelines (follitropin a and b interferon) are under preparation. In response to the European Commission's wish to stimulate the global development of biosimilars, biosimilar reference medicines sourced outside the European Economic Area will be allowed (the basis will always be a locally licensed product, but 'Bridging studies' to another product licensed in another part of the world will be allowed). Currently in the E.U., the reference product for a biosimilar has to be licensed in the E.U. and therefore clinical trials have to be repeated in all three major markets (Japan, E.U. and U.S.). This important change will enter into force after the revision of the EU so-called "over-arching" biosimilar guideline, already under review and expected for early 2013. While the EMA has adopted so far a balanced approach for all biosimilars, which allows evaluation on a case-by-case basis in accordance with relevant biosimilar guidelines, it seems that there is some willingness to simplify the pathway in very specific circumstances. For a very simple biological fully characterized on the quality level, a biosimilar could be authorized based on a bioequivalence study combined only with an extensive quality package. With respect to vaccines, the CHMP position is that it is at present unlikely that these products may be characterized at the molecular level, and that each vaccine product must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In Japan, guidelines defining the regulatory approval pathway for follow-on biologics were finalized in March 2009. These guidelines set out the requirements on CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control), preclinical and clinical data to be considered for the development of the new application category of biosimilars. Unlike the CHMP guidelines, the main scope of the Japanese guidelines includes recombinant proteins and polypeptides, but not polysaccharides such as LMWH. In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, in particular Title VII, Subtitle A "Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act," was signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010, This law amends the Public Health Service Act to create an abbreviated licensure pathway (351k) for biological products that are demonstrated to be "biosimilar" to or "interchangeable" with an FDA-licensed biological product. On February 15, 2012, the FDA published for consultation three draft guidance documents for biosimilar development: Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product, Quality Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Protein Product, and Biosimilars: Questions and Answers Regarding Implementation of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. These guidance documents remain in draft format. A fourth document on clinical pharmacology has yet to be published. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (Title IV of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, Public Law 112-144, which was signed by the President on July 9, 2012), authorizes the FDA to assess and collect user fees for certain activities in connection with biosimilar biological product development, for certain applications and supplements for approval of biosimilar biological products, on establishments where approved biosimilar biological product products are made, and on biosimilar biological products after approval. At the December 2012 FDA-CMS meeting, the agency stated that they had received 50 requests for initial meetings with potential biosimilar sponsors to talk about development plans and conducted 34. The agency has now 77 received 12 biosimilar INDs and has many other active programs with no IND submitted. Proposals have involved 12 reference products. Focus on Medical Devices In the E.U., the European Commission released its legislative proposal on medical devices on September 26, 2012. The new revised framework could enter into force by 2015, if approved at first reading. The main change of this proposal is the replacement of the current three directives by two regulations (one for medical devices and one for in-vitro medical devices). The objectives of the legislation are to simplify and strengthen the current E.U. legal framework by implementing a robust and transparent regulatory framework. The revision impacts the pre-market assessment of devices by strengthening the oversight of Notified Bodies (NBs), post-market safety and continuous assessment of NB compliance, and the management of the regulatory system (better coordination, transparency and communication). A "scrutiny procedure" (via a European decentralized approach) would be used for high-risk Class III devices (novel technologies or specific public health threats). The new revised framework also formally introduces the concept of "companion diagnostic", which is expected to deliver a more accurate definition of the patient population that will benefit from a given product. In addition, enhanced vigilance and post-market surveillance systems for medical devices, with greater harmonization of E.U. member states' market surveillance activities, are expected. In the U.S., in January 2011, the FDA announced a Plan of Action, which includes 36 specific actions, to modernize and improve the FDA's premarket review of medical devices. In the two years since the FDA began implementing the plan, the speed and predictability of device review have improved for the first time in almost a decade, including significant reductions in the time it takes the FDA to review applications and the size of application backlogs. These results have been achieved even though the Plan of Action has not yet been fully implemented. The FDA has met almost all of its early implementation timelines. As implementation continues and the impact of the Plan grows over the next several years, the FDA expects performance on review times and reductions in backlogs to continue to improve. The new process improvements and resources made available by this year's reauthorization of the Medical Device User Fee Act (MDUFA III) will accelerate the FDA's ability to make premarket review of devices predictable, consistent, transparent, efficient, and timely. Recent biomedical breakthroughs are pushing medicine toward tailored therapeutics, or personalized medicine. This means an increase in the development of companion diagnostics. To address this issue, the FDA issued the draft guidance In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices on July 12, 2011, to communicate to industry how the FDA defines these devices and what the Agency's regulatory requirements are for them. The finalization of this guidance has been delayed. Focus on transparency and public access to documents Over the last two to three years the pharmaceutical industry has been subject to growing pressure for greater transparency about clinical trials (conduct and results). Regulatory authorities are also being pushed for more openness and transparency, for example by making more comprehensive disclosure about the rationale and basis of regulatory decisions on medicinal products, so as to enhance the credibility of the regulatory process. This is a significant driver of the transparency initiatives undertaken in several countries. Pharmaceutical manufacturers have committed to publishing protocols and results of clinical studies performed with their products in publicly accessible registries. In addition, both ICH and non-ICH countries often impose mandatory disclosure of clinical trials information. From a regulatory perspective, ambitious initiatives have been undertaken by the major regulatory authorities. 78 E.U. pharmaceutical legislation for medicinal products requires national regulatory authorities and the EMA to actively publish information concerning authorization and supervision of medicinal products. The EMA has introduced a series of initiatives aimed at improving the transparency of its activities, such as improving the format of the European Public Assessment Report, web-published product approvals, withdrawals and rejections. In addition, there is an increased focus on comparative efficacy and effectiveness. With the new E.U. pharmacovigilance legislation, there will be greater transparency, especially with regard to communication of safety issues (e.g. public hearings, specific European web-portals with information on medicinal products). Finally, patients and consumers are increasingly involved in the work of the EMA's scientific committees. The European regulators recently took a major step towards more openness and transparency by giving much wider access to documents originated by pharmaceutical companies and submitted to the regulatory authorities for scientific evaluation after a regulatory decision is taken. Whilst it is anticipated that these documents would be redacted before disclosure in order to protect information contained therein that cannot be disclosed (commercial confidential information or personal data), the draft document released in June 2011 for public consultation by the EMA and the Head of Medicines Agencies (HMA) gives a narrower definition of commercially confidential information and personal data within the context of the marketing authorization dossier. Consequently, the scope of the information accessible to the public has been considerably widened (e.g., clinical study reports in a marketing authorization dossier, but also a significant portion of non-clinical test data). During the second half of 2012 the EMA informed stakeholders about its intention to implement by January 2014 the previously announced proactive policy for public disclosure of raw data from clinical trials that are included in marketing authorization dossiers of approved medicinal products. Protection of patients' personal data, data format definition and document redaction, rules of engagement for third parties willing to conduct new analyses on data files, legal aspects about risk of infringement of commercially confidential information are among the main ethical and technical issues to be overcome before the new transparency policy is enforced, and are to be discussed between the EMA and its stakeholders over the first part of 2013. The EMA does not routinely require raw data files as part of the submitted dossier, implying that this new policy will apply in particular to prospective submissions. In the highly competitive field of medicinal products, it is still necessary to reinforce the principle that non-innovators cannot obtain marketing authorization based solely on the originator's data released in the E.U. for as long as the data protection period is in force. As of the end of 2012, the E.U. disclosure policy appears more advanced than that in other major markets. In the U.S., FDA Commissioner, Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, launched FDA's Transparency Initiative in June 2009, in response to President Obama's January 2009 "Open Government Initiative". The objective of the initiative was to render the FDA much more transparent and open to the American public by providing the public with useful, user-friendly information about agency activities and decision-making. The FDA Transparency Initiative has three phases: Phase I  Improving the understanding of FDA basics (completed with ongoing updates); Phase II  Improving FDA's disclosure of information to the public (ongoing); and Phase III  Improving FDA's transparency to regulated industry (ongoing). Proposals to improve transparency and access to information were released for consultation for both Phase II (May 19, 2010) and Phase III (January 6, 2011). Some of the less controversial proposals have been implemented; others, such as proactive release of information that the Agency has in its possession, may require revisions to U.S. federal regulations. 79 Other new legislation proposed or pending implementation Clinical trials applications: a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, repealing Directive 2001/20/EC, was released in July 2012 with the following objectives: 1)To establish a modern regulatory framework for submission, assessment and regulatory follow-up of applications for clinical trials, taking into account the multinational research environment. The goal is to reduce administrative burdens and operational costs, and cut lead times to launch clinical trials, insofar as they are caused by regulation. 2)Regulatory requirements which are adapted to practical considerations, constraints and needs, without compromising the safety, wellbeing and rights of participants in clinical trials and without compromising data robustness, with a goal of reducing administrative burdens and operational costs as regards two key regulatory requirements: the annual safety report and obligatory insurance/indemnification. 3)Addressing the global dimension of clinical trials when ensuring compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP). The operational objective is to ensure that clinical trials conducted in non-EU countries comply with GCP. Discussions have begun on this proposal (2012/2013) and the final regulation is expected to come into force by 2016. Overall, the replacement of Directive 2001/20/EC by a Regulation is expected to introduce a harmonized review pathway and timelines without interfering with Member States' competences in terms of ethical aspects. A single E.U. submission portal is expected to significantly streamline the review process and will also allow increased transparency over the conduct and results of clinical trials. Falsified medicines: implementation of Directive 2011/62/EU: The European Union (E.U.) has reformed the rules for importing into the E.U. active substances for medicinal products for human use. As of January 2, 2013, all imported active substances must have been manufactured in compliance with standards of good manufacturing practices (GMP) at least equivalent to the GMP of the E.U. The manufacturing standards in the EU for active substances are those of the "International Conference for Harmonisation"  ICH Q7. As of July 2, 2013, this compliance must be confirmed in writing by the competent authority of the exporting country. This document must also confirm that the plant where the active substance was manufactured is subject to control and enforcement of good manufacturing practices at least equivalent to that in the E.U. In practice, the full implementation of Directive 2011/62/EU by July 2013 could generate temporary drug shortages in the E.U. in those cases where manufacturers will be unable to supply the required documentation. Pricing & Reimbursement Rising overall healthcare costs are leading to efforts to curb drug expenditures in most markets in which Sanofi operates. Increasingly these efforts result in pricing and market access controls for pharmaceuticals. The nature and impact of these controls vary from country to country, but some common themes are reference pricing, systematic price reductions, formularies, volume limitations, patient co-pay requirements, and generic substitution. In addition, governments and third-party payers are increasingly demanding comparative / relative effectiveness data to support their decision making process. They are also increasing their utilization of emerging healthcare information technologies such as electronic prescribing and health records to enforce transparency and tight compliance with these regulations and controls. As a result, the environment in which pharmaceutical companies must operate in order to make their products available to patients and providers who need them continues to grow more complex each year. Significant changes in the Pharmaceutical/Healthcare environment emerged since 2010: In the United States, implementation of health insurance and market reforms continued during 2012. These reforms are expected to lead to a large number of uninsured being covered by 2014, either through 80 state programs or mandatory enrollment in private plans. Cost-containment pressures affecting pharmaceuticals are also persisting in the public and private health care sectors. In Europe, emergency cost containment measures and reforms introduced since 2010 in several countries (including, Germany, Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland) are being implemented. These will significantly affect the size of the pharmaceutical market. A number of Central and Eastern European countries are also implementing cost containment measures (Hungary, Slovakia, Poland). In parallel, the full effect of the new German laws (end to the free-price-setting system) has only just begun to see negative dividends for the industry. In 2011, France implemented numerous changes to pharmaceutical access. In addition, health economic assessment is now officially part of the price determination in countries such as France and Spain. Details of the UK value-based pricing of drugs scheme are still to be finalized and it is not clear how or if the emphasis of the Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) used by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) will be diminished. In Japan, along with the usual biennial price cuts (April 2012), the extension of price premiums for drug development and measures to encourage the access to new medications have been announced. Regardless of the exact method, we believe that third-party payers will continue to act to curb the cost of pharmaceutical products. While the impact of these measures cannot be predicted with certainty, we are taking the necessary steps to defend the accessibility and price of our products in order to reflect the value of our innovative product offerings: We actively engage with our key stakeholders on the value of our products to them. These stakeholders  including physicians, patient groups, pharmacists, government authorities and third-party payers  can have a significant impact on the market accessibility of our products. We continue to add flexibility and adaptability to our operations so as to better prepare, diagnose, and address issues in individual markets. Keeping in mind the importance of recognizing the value of our products and the high cost of research and development, we continue to analyze innovative pricing and access strategies that balance patient accessibility with appropriate rewards for innovation. Specifically, we are involved in risk sharing agreements with payers, whereby part of the financial risk related to a treatment's success is carried by the marketing company. Those agreements usually foresee that the clinical efficacy of a drug is followed after its commercialization, for a specified period of time and patient population. The price and reimbursement level of the drug is then either confirmed or revised based on these post-marketing results. Insurance and Risk Coverage We are protected by four key insurance programs, relying not only on the traditional corporate insurance and reinsurance market but also on our captive insurance company, Carraig Insurance Ltd (Carraig). These four key programs cover Property & Business Interruption, General & Product Liability, Stock and Transit, and Directors & Officers Liability. Our captive insurance company, Carraig, participates in our coverage for various lines of insurance mainly including excess property, stock and transit and general & product liability. Carraig is run under the supervision of the Irish regulatory authorities, is wholly-owned by Sanofi, and has sufficient resources to meet those portions of our risks that it has agreed to cover. It sets premiums for Group entities at market rates. Claims are assessed using the traditional models applied by insurance and reinsurance companies, and the company's reserves are regularly verified and confirmed by independent actuaries. Our Property & Business Interruption program covers all Group entities worldwide, wherever it is possible to use a centralized program operated by our captive insurance company. This approach shares risk between Group entities, enabling us to set deductibles and guarantees that are appropriate to the needs of local entities. It also incorporates a prevention program, including a comprehensive site visit program covering our production, storage, research and distribution facilities and standardized repair and maintenance procedures across all sites. Specialist 81 site visits are conducted every year to address specific needs, such as testing of sprinkler systems or emergency plans to deal with flooding risks. The Stock and Transit program protects goods of all kinds owned by the Group that are in transit nationally or internationally, whatever the means of transport, and all our inventories wherever they are located. Sharing risk between Group entities means that we can set deductibles at appropriate levels, for instance differentiating between goods that require temperature controlled distribution and those that do not. We have developed a prevention program with assistance from experts, implementing best practices in this area at our distribution sites. This program, which is led by our captive insurance company, has substantial capacity, largely to deal with the growth in sea freight which can lead to a concentration of value in a single ship. Our General & Product Liability program has been renewed for all our subsidiaries worldwide wherever it was possible to do so, despite the increasing reluctance in the insurance and reinsurance market to cover product liability risks for large pharmaceutical groups. For several years, insurers have been reducing product liability cover because of the difficulty of insuring some products that have been subject to numerous claims. These products are excluded from the cover provided by insurers, and hence from the cover obtained by us on the insurance market. This applies to a few of our products, principally those described in Note D.22.a) to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 in this annual report. Because of these market conditions we have increased, year by year, the extent to which we self-insure. The principal risk exposure for our pharmaceutical products is covered with low deductibles at the country level, the greatest level of risk being retained by our captive insurance company. The level of risk self-insured by the Group  including our captive reinsurance company  enables us to retain control over the management and prevention of risk. Our negotiations with third-party insurers and reinsurers are tailored to our specific risks. In particular, they allow for differential treatment of products in the development phase, for the discrepancies in risk exposure between European countries and the United States, and for specific issues arising in certain jurisdictions. Coverage is adjusted every year in order to take into account the relative weight of new product liability risks, such as those relating to rare diseases with very low exposure or to healthcare products which do not require marketing approval. Our cover for risks that are not specific to the pharmaceutical industry (general liability) is designed to address the potential impacts of our operations. For all lines of business of Carraig, outstanding claims are covered by provisions for the estimated cost of settling all claims incurred but not paid at the balance sheet date, whether reported or not, together with all related claims handling expenses. Where there is sufficient data history from the company or from the market for claims made and settled, management  with assistance from independent actuaries  prepares an actuarial estimate of the company's exposure to unreported claims for the risks covered. The actuaries perform an actuarial valuation of the company's IBNR (incurred but not reported) and ALAE (allocated loss adjustment expense) liabilities at year end. Two ultimate loss projections (based upon reported losses and paid losses respectively) are computed each year using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method; these projections form the basis for the provisions set. The Directors & Officers Liability program protects the legal entities under our control, and their directors and officers. Our captive insurance company is not involved in this program. The Group also operates other insurance programs, but these are of much lesser importance than those described above. All the insurance programs are backed by best-in-class insurers and reinsurers and are designed in such a way that we can integrate most newly-acquired businesses on a continuous basis. Our cover has been designed to reflect our risk profile and the capacity available in the insurance market. By centralizing our major programs, not only do we reduce costs, but we also provide world-class coverage for the entire Group. 82 C.

The financial effects of the Genzyme acquisition are presented in Note D.1.2. to our consolidated financial statements, included in this annual report at Item 18. The financial effects of the Merial acquisition are presented in Note D.1.3. to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010, included in our annual report on Form 20-F for that year. In certain countries, we carry on some of our business operations through joint ventures with local partners. We have also entered into worldwide marketing arrangements. Two of our major products (Plavix® and Aprovel®) are marketed through an alliance with BMS, Actonel® is marketed through an alliance with Warner Chilcott, and Zaltrap® is marketed through an alliance with Regeneron. See "Item 5  Financial Presentation of Alliances". Internal organization of activities Sanofi and its subsidiaries form a group, organized around three activities: Pharmaceuticals, Human Vaccines (Vaccines) and Animal Health. Within the Group, responsibility for research and development (R&D) in their respective fields rests with Sanofi and Genzyme Corporation (Pharmaceuticals), Sanofi Pasteur and Sanofi Pasteur, Inc. (Vaccines), and Merial Ltd and Merial S.A.S. (Animal Health); these entities define strategic priorities and coordinate R&D efforts. To fulfill this role, these entities subcontract R&D work to subsidiaries that have the necessary resources. They also license patents, manufacturing know-how and trademarks to certain French and foreign subsidiaries. In these cases, the licensee subsidiaries manufacture and distribute the Group's products, either directly or via local distribution entities. 83 Our industrial property rights, patents and trademarks are mainly held by the following companies: Pharmaceuticals: Sanofi, Aventis Pharma S.A. (France), Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH (Germany), Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC and Genzyme Corporation (United States). Vaccines: Sanofi Pasteur (France) and Sanofi Pasteur, Inc. (United States). Animal Health: Merial Ltd (United Kingdom) and Merial S.A.S. (France). For a description of our principal items of property, plant and equipment, see Item 4.D. "Property, Plant and Equipment". These assets are mainly held by Sanofi Pasteur, Genzyme Corporation, Sanofi Chimie, Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, Sanofi Pasteur Inc. and Sanofi Winthrop Industrie. D. Property, Plant and Equipment D.1. Overview Our headquarters are located in Paris, France. See " Office Space" below. We operate our business through office premises and research, production and logistics facilities in approximately 100 countries around the world. Our office premises house of all our support functions, plus operational representatives from our subsidiaries and the Group. A breakdown of these sites by use and by ownership status (owned versus leasehold) is provided below. Breakdowns are based on surface area. All surface area figures are unaudited. Breakdown of sites by use* Industrial 63% Research 13% Offices 12% Logistics 7% Other 5% * Our Vaccines and Animal Health activities occupy offices and research, production and warehouse facilities. These sites are allocated between the first four categories in the table above as appropriate. Breakdown of sites by ownership status Leasehold 32% Owned 68% We own most of our research and development and production facilities, either freehold or under finance leases with a purchase option exercisable at expiration of the lease. D.2. Description of our sites Sanofi industrial sites We carry out our industrial production at 112 sites in nearly 40 countries (including 40 sites in emerging markets): 82 sites for our Pharmaceuticals activity, including Genzyme; 13 sites for the industrial operations of Sanofi Pasteur in vaccines; 17 sites for the Animal Health activities of Merial. 84 In 2012, we produced the following quantities: Pharmaceuticals: 3,520 million boxes produced and packaged (4,117 including outsourced production) and for Genzyme, 9.1 million vials (42.7 million including outsourced production); Vaccines: 417 million containers prepared (451 million including outsourced production); Animal Health: 500 million doses of vaccines for all species other than avian, 90 billion doses of avian vaccines, and 1.7 billion units of pharmaceutical products (pipettes, pills, vials, syringes). We believe that our production facilities are in compliance with all regulatory requirements, are properly maintained and are generally suitable for future needs. Nonetheless, we regularly inspect and evaluate these facilities with regard to environmental, health, safety and security matters, quality compliance and capacity utilization. For more information about our property, plant and equipment, see Note D.3 to the consolidated financial statements. Industrial Sites: Pharmaceuticals Production of chemical and pharmaceutical products is the responsibility of our Industrial Affairs function, which is also in charge of most of our logistics facilities (distribution and storage centers). The sites where our major drugs, active ingredients, specialties and medical devices are manufactured are: France: Ambarès (Aprovel®, Depakine®, Multaq®), Aramon (irbesartan), Le Trait (Lovenox®), Lyon Gerland (Thymoglobulin®, Celsior®), Maisons-Alfort (Lovenox®), Neuville (dronedarone), Quetigny (Stilnox®, Plavix®), Sisteron (clopidogrel bisulfate, dronedarone, zolpidem tartrate), Tours (Stilnox®, Aprovel®, Xatral®), Vitry-sur Seine (docetaxel/aflibercept); Germany: Frankfurt (insulins, Ramipril®, Lantus®, Tritace®, medical devices, Apidra®); Ireland: Waterford (Myozyme®, Lumizyme®, Cholestagel®, Thymoglobulin®, Renagel®, Renvela®, and Cerezyme®); Italy: Scoppito (Tritace®, Amaryl®) and Anagni (Depakine®, Fasturtec®, Rifa antibiotic family); United Kingdom: Dagenham (Taxotere®, Eloxatine®, currently being transferred to Frankfurt in Germany), Fawdon (Plavix®, Aprovel®), Haverhill (sevelamer hydrochloride API (Renagel®), sevelamer carbonate API (Renvela®), Cerezyme®, Fabrazyme®, Thyrogen®, Myozyme®, etc), and Holmes Chapel (Nasacort®, Flutiform®); Hungary: Ujpest (irbesartan), Csanyikvölgy (Lovenox®); Japan: Kawagoe (Plavix®); United States: Kansas City (Allegra®, currently being transferred to Tours and Compiègne in France), and Chattanooga (Consumer Health Care products); Brazil: Suzano (Amaryl® and Novalgine®) and Campinas (generics); Mexico: Ocoyoacac (Flagyl®). The rare diseases specialist Genzyme became a Sanofi subsidiary in April 2011. This acquisition expanded our presence in biotechnologies, especially rare diseases. Genzyme manages 11 production sites and works with more than 20 subcontractors to manufacture 22 commercial products over a broad range of technological platforms. Genzyme's sites are as follows: Belgium: Geel (alglucosidase alpha: Myozyme®/Lumizyme®); United States: Allston (Cerezyme®, Fabrazyme®); Framingham (Fabrazyme®, Myozyme®, Thyrogen®, Seprafilm, Hyaluronic Acid); Cambridge (Carticel®, Epicel®, MACI® (Matrix-induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation); Ridgefield (Synvisc®, Hectorol®, Mozobil®, Jonexa®, Prevelle®); and Lynnwood, Washington (Leukine®), a former Bayer Healthcare site; 85 Australia: Perth (MACI®); Denmark: Copenhagen (MACI®). Industrial Sites: Vaccines (Sanofi Pasteur) The headquarters of our Vaccines division, Sanofi Pasteur, are located in Lyon, France. Sanofi Pasteur has production and/or R&D sites at Swiftwater, Cambridge, Rockville, Canton and Orlando (United States); Toronto, (Canada); Marcy l'Étoile, Neuville and Val de Reuil (France); Shenzhen (China); Pilar (Argentina); Chachoengsao (Thailand); Hyderabad (India); and Ocoyoacac (Mexico.) In May 2009, we began construction of a new vaccine manufacturing center at our Neuville-sur-Saône site in France. This €300 million investment, the largest ever made by Sanofi, is intended to gradually transition the existing chemical activity to vaccine production from 2013 onwards. In 2010, Sanofi Pasteur acquired VaxDesign, a U.S. company located in Orlando, Florida. VaxDesign's Modular IMmune In-vitro Construct (MIMIC®) System is designed to capture genetic and environmental diversity and predict human immune responses. The MIMIC® platform is expected to accelerate vaccine development, reduce time to market and increase success rates in the pre-clinical and clinical stages. Sanofi Pasteur owns its Research and Development and production sites, either freehold or under finance leases with a purchase option exercisable at expiration of the lease. Industrial Sites: Animal Health (Merial) Since Merck and Sanofi announced in March 2011 that they were maintaining separate activities in the field of animal health, Merial has become a dedicated Sanofi division. Merial has 17 industrial sites in nine different countries, 9 R&D sites, and numerous administrative offices including its headquarters at Lyon, France. Merial industrial sites are as follows: Brazil: Paulinia (avermectin-based pharmaceutical products, and vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease and rabies); China: Nanchang (live avian vaccines) and Nanjing (inactivated avian vaccines); France: Toulouse (Frontline® and clostridial vaccines), St-Priest LPA (vaccines), Lyon Gerland, Saint-Herblon (Coophavet), Lentilly (packaging); Italy: Noventa (inactivated avian vaccines); Netherlands: Lelystad (antigen and vaccine against foot-and-mouth disease); Uruguay: Montevideo (primarily anti-clostridium antigens); United Kingdom: Pirbright (antigens and vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease); United States: dedicated facilities for Merial's avian vaccines at Berlin (Maryland), Gainesville (Georgia) and Raleigh (North Carolina); dedicated facility for mammal viral and bacterial vaccines at Athens (Georgia); and dedicated facility for autogenous bovine and swine vaccines at Worthington (Minnesota); New Zealand: Ancare facility, Auckland (pharmaceutical products, mainly for the bovine market). Research & Development sites: Pharmaceuticals Research and Development activities are conducted at 15 sites: 6 operational sites in France: Chilly/Longjumeau, Montpellier, Paris, Strasbourg, Toulouse and Vitry/Alfortville; 2 sites in the rest of Europe (Germany and the Netherlands), the largest of which is in Frankfurt (Germany); 86 5 sites in the United States, the largest being the Bridgewater, Cambridge and Framingham sites; 2 sites in Asia with 1 clinical research unit in Beijing, China and 1 unit in Japan. D.3. Acquisitions, Capital Expenditures and Divestitures The carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2012 was €10,578 million. During 2012, we invested €1,351 million (see Note D.3. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18 of this annual report) in increasing capacity and improving productivity at our various production and R&D sites. Our principal capital expenditures and divestitures in 2010, 2011 and 2012 are described in Notes D.1. ("Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation"), D.2. ("Merial"), D.3. ("Property, plant and equipment") and D.4. ("Goodwill and other intangible assets") to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18 of this annual report. As of December 31, 2012, our firm commitments in respect of future capital expenditures amounted to €323 million. The principal sites involved were (for the Pharmaceuticals activity) the industrial facilities at Frankfurt (Germany), Framingham and Allston (United States), Vertolaye (France), and in Hungary; and for the Vaccines activity, the facility at Swiftwater (United States). In the medium term and assuming no changes in the scope of consolidation, we expect to invest on average €1.4 billion a year in property, plant and equipment. We believe that our own cash resources and the undrawn portion of our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund these expenditures. Our principal ongoing investments are described below. During 2012, our industrial network actively contributed to the development of our seven growth platforms: Emerging Markets, Diabetes Solutions, Consumer Health Care, New Genzyme and Other Innovative Products (all of which are part of our Pharmaceuticals activity), Vaccines, and Animal Health. Pharmaceuticals In our Diabetes Solutions growth platform, the Frankfurt site  the principal manufacturing center for Sanofi Diabetes products  is being equipped with a new aseptic processing area that uses isolator technology to significantly improve the aseptic filling process. This investment will be operational in 2016. The Sanofi Diabetes industrial network is expanding its footprint in emerging markets, both in Russia and in China (Beijing), where a new facility inaugurated in 2012 has begun assembly and packaging of SoloSTAR®, the pre-filled injection system for Lantus®. Our industrial pharmaceutical operations for the Consumer Health Care platform are based on four growth hubs: in Europe, Asia (where a new consumer products facility at Hangzhou in China with a production capacity of 3 billion pills will be operational early in 2013), South America, and the United States (focused on the Chattem site in Tennessee, which in 2012 led preparations for the U.S. launch of the pediatric oral suspension formulation of Allegra®). The industrial development teams also contributed to over 30 new launches of consumer products during 2012, expanding our presence in this highly competitive market. In the Other Innovative Products platform, our industrial teams are pooling their expertise to develop ever more sophisticated processes. Three dedicated biotech hubs are being developed in Europe at Frankfurt (Germany); Vitry-sur-Seine (France), our biggest integrated cell culture facility, which in 2012 produced the first technical batches of aflibercept (the active ingredient of Zaltrap®); and Lyon Gerland (France), a new world center dedicated to the production of thymoglobulin® for the prevention and treatment of transplant rejection. During 2012, our teams at Lyon prepared a dossier for the healthcare authorities as part of the process of transferring production to this site. The development of our Emerging Markets platform is built on a network of over 30 regional and local industrial sites in 20 countries, supporting growth in these markets. In addition to our recent investments in China in Diabetes and Consumer Health Care, a number of other projects are under way. In the Middle 87 East, 2012 saw Sanofi lay the foundation stone for a facility in Saudi Arabia that will produce solid pharmaceutical formulations, which will be marketed from 2015. In Latin America, where we already have a large industrial footprint, we are building a dedicated hormonal products facility in Brasilia. Also during 2012, the Ankleshwar Pharma site in Gujarat State (India) handled packaging and quality control through to release of the first commercial batches of AllSTAR, the first high-quality affordable insulin pen specifically intended for the local market. The Goa site (India) invested to extend its solid formulation production capacity to around 2.5 billion pills a year. And in Algeria, Sanofi signed an agreement with the local authorities for a major industrial investment that will lead to the construction of our biggest industrial complex in the Africa-Middle East region. The industrial network of our Pharmaceuticals activity continued throughout 2012 with the roll-out of the economic performance improvement plan launched in 2011. This plan is intended to deliver performance standards commensurate with the diversity of our pharmaceuticals businesses and markets, and to meet the industrial challenges ahead to 2020. Our Industrial Affairs department is constantly adapting to market needs, as a result of which a number of sites are in the process of sale or closure, such as Kansas City (United States), Dagenham and Fawdon (United Kingdom), Romainville (France), and Hlohovec (Slovakia). The industrial network of the New Genzyme growth platform is predominantly located in the United States where major investments are under way, especially at the Framingham Biologics site, which was approved by the FDA and the EMA in 2012 for the manufacture of Fabrazyme® (Fabry disease). The site at Allston (Massachusetts) has initiated a major investment program in connection with the implementation of its compliance remediation workplan, approved by the FDA in January 2012. Finally, the Bayer Healthcare facility at Lynnwood (Washington), specializing in the manufacture of Leukine®, joined the Genzyme industrial network in 2012. Vaccines (Sanofi Pasteur) Sanofi Pasteur is undergoing a major investment phase, particularly the new dedicated dengue fever vaccine facility at Neuville (France), which will produce its first batches in 2014. Two new dedicated influenza vaccine facilities are in the start-up phase: Shenzhen (China) is currently testing its production processes, while Ocoyoacac (Mexico) was approved by the Mexican authorities at the start of 2012 and began production in time for the Mexican influenza vaccination program in September 2012. In response to observations made by the FDA during routine inspections conducted in 2012 in Toronto (Canada) and Marcy l'Etoile (France), Sanofi Pasteur initiated a compliance program to address the quality issues identified. Animal Health (Merial) Merial is adapting its industrial capacity to keep pace with the growing animal health market. In 2012, Merial acquired Newport Laboratories, which has an autogenous vaccine production facility at Worthington, Minnesota (United States). In China, Merial is investing in a new site in the Nanchang high-tech development zone, in order to service future growth in vaccines for avian and other species in the local market. In Europe, a substantial portion of the investment in recent years has been directed at the transfer of vaccine production from Lyon Gerland (France) to a new site nearby at Saint Priest (Lyon Porte des Alpes). At the Toulouse site (France), Merial is adapting its production capacity to new products by investing in a packaging line for use in the manufacturing of Certifect® (compliant with European Union Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) and in a building for the production of the injectable form of Zactran®. Industrial innovation was a key theme in 2012. The fourth "Innovation Trophy" awards again illustrated the striking progress being made in this area, which we regard as a top priority in our industrial strategy. The 2012 Pierre Potier Prize was awarded to the Chemicals and Biotechnology teams, who developed an innovative industrial process for the production of artemisinin, the basis for antimalarial drugs. Investment is ongoing in the installation of an innovative biosynthesis process at two French sites, Saint-Aubin-lès-Elbeuf (Seine Maritime) and Vertolaye (Puy de Dôme), with the aim of improving the international competitiveness of our corticosteroid production. 88 D.4. Office Space As part of the rationalization of our office sites in the Paris region of France, we have since mid-2009 been carrying out a medium-term review of our office space master plan for the Greater Paris area. This review will result in all our Group support functions and operating divisions being housed on a smaller number of sites (5 in 2012 on completion of phase 1, and 3 by 2015). All of these sites will meet environmental certification standards, and offer cost-effective space solutions. Item 4A. Unresolved Staff Comments N/A 89 Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report at Item 18. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and with IFRS adopted by the European Union as of December 31, 2012. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. See "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the beginning of this document. Unless otherwise stated, all change figures in this item are given on a reported basis. 2012 Overview During 2012, we continued to follow the strategic direction established in 2008 and to pursue the objectives for 2012-2015 announced in September 2011 and reiterated in February 2013. The thrust of these objectives is fourfold: grow a global healthcare leader with synergistic platforms, bring innovative products to market, seize value-enhancing growth opportunities, and adapt our structure for future challenges and opportunities. Our 2012 full-year results were affected by the loss of exclusivity for Plavix® and Avapro® in the United States in the first half, and by ongoing generic competition for our former flagship products. However, the erosion in our net sales and profitability was cushioned by our growth platforms, the contribution from Genzyme, and tight cost control. Our 2012 net sales reached €34,947 million, 4.7% higher than in 2011 (0.5% at constant exchange rates, see definition at " Presentation of Net Sales" below), driven mainly by the performance of the Emerging Markets, Diabetes, Vaccines, Consumer Health Care, Animal Health and Other Innovative Products growth platforms, by advances for the Generics business, and by the contribution from Genzyme (whose net sales have only been consolidated since April 2011). This performance was achieved in spite of the significant impact of competition from generics, which cost us €1.2 billion in lost sales (€1.3 billion at constant exchange rates, see " Impacts from generic competition" below), and the ending of the co-promotion agreement with Teva on Copaxone®. Milestones for our research efforts during 2012 included the launch of Zaltrap® (metastatic colorectal cancer) and Aubagio® (multiple sclerosis) in the United States. The ongoing realignment of our resources cut research and development expenses by 0.4% and limited the rise in selling and general expenses to 1.8%, after including Genzyme's costs over the full year. Business net income was €8,179 million, 7.0% lower than in 2011 on a reported basis, mainly due to the loss of exclusivity for Plavix® and Avapro® in the United States and to competition from generics. Business earnings per share was €6.20, 6.8% lower than in 2011. Business net income and business earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures which our management uses to monitor our operational performance, and which are defined at " Business Net Income" below. Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi came to €4,967 million, down 12.8% on 2011. Basic earnings per share amounted to €3.76, also 12.8% lower than in 2011; diluted earnings per share for 2012 were €3.74 (12.8% lower). During 2012, we continued with our policy of targeted acquisitions and of alliances in research and development. In Generics, we announced in October 2012 that we had signed an agreement to acquire Genfar S.A., a Colombian pharmaceutical company which is a key generics player not only in Colombia, but also in other Latin American countries. Closing of this acquisition is subject to certain conditions, and is expected to take place during the first half of 2013. In biosurgery, we acquired the U.S. medical devices company Pluromed, Inc. in April 2012. We strengthened our Animal Health division with the April 2012 acquisition of Newport Laboratories (a U.S. American producer of autogenous vaccines for the bovine and swine markets), and by entering into an agreement to acquire the animal health division of Dosch Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd that will give Merial an entry point into the 90 Indian market. We also entered into various alliances and licensing deals to extend or strengthen our existing research fields. In October 2012, Sanofi and Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that they were restructuring their alliance following the loss of exclusivity for Plavix® and Avapro®/Avalide® in many major markets. The new agreement, which took effect on January 1, 2013, returns the rights for Plavix® and Avapro®/Avalide® to Sanofi worldwide (except for the United States and Puerto Rico for Plavix®), thereby giving Sanofi exclusive control over these products and their commercialization. In August 2012, we sold our interest in Société Financière des Laboratoires de Cosmétologie Yves Rocher, in line with our desire to focus on strategic activities. As of December 31, 2012, we had reduced our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents to €7.7 billion, compared with €10.9 billion as of December 31, 2011. The Annual General Meeting of shareholders, to be held on May 3, 2013, will be asked to approve a dividend of €2.77 per share in respect of the 2012 fiscal year, representing a payout equivalent to 45% of our business net income. While we remain focused on our objectives for 2012-2015 announced in September 2011, we expect erosion from generic competition to continue, with a negative impact on net income in 2013 (see " Impacts from generic competition" below). While we continue to save costs, we expect that part of the savings will be reinvested in product launches and late-stage clinical trials. Our operations generate significant cash flow. We recorded €8,171 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to €9,319 million in 2011. During the course of 2012, we paid out €3.5 billion in dividends and repaid part of our debt. With respect to our financial position, we ended 2012 with our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (see definition at " Liquidity and Capital Resources" below) at €7,719 million (2011: €10,859 million). Debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, is a financial indicator that is used by management to measure the Company's overall net indebtedness and to manage the Group's equity capital. In order to assess the Company's financing risk, we also use a "gearing ratio", a non-GAAP financial measure, that we define as the ratio of debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, to total equity. Our gearing ratio was 13.4% at the end of 2012 versus 19.3% at the end of 2011. See " Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. 91 Impacts from generic competition Some of our flagship products continued to experience sales erosion in 2012 due to generic competition. While we do not believe it is possible to state with certainty what level of net sales would have been achieved in the absence of generic competition, we are able to estimate the impact of generic competition for each product. A comparison of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (see " Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2011") shows that competition from generics was associated with a decline of €1.2 billion in net sales in 2012 (or €1.3 billion at constant exchange rates). The table below shows the impact by product.

Despite the introduction of generics in the second half of 2012, Myslee® in Japan posted a 2.8% rise in net sales in 2012 (or a fall of 4.9% at constant exchange rates), to €292 million. We expect erosion from generic competition to continue in 2013, with a negative impact on net income. The following products are expected to be impacted by generics in 2013: products for which new generic competition can reasonably be expected in 2013 based on expiration dates, patents or other regulatory or commercial exclusivity: Allegra® in Japan; products for which generics competition began in 2012 and is expected to continue in 2013: Plavix®, Avapro® and Eloxatine® in the United States (net sales of Plavix® and Avapro® in the U.S. are not included in our consolidated net sales), Co-Aprovel® in Europe, and Myslee® and Taxotere® in Japan; products which already faced generic competition as of January 1, 2012, but for which 2013 sales can reasonably be expected to be subject to further erosion: Plavix®, Eloxatine®, Aprovel® and Taxotere® in Europe; and Lovenox®, Ambien®, Xyzal®, Taxotere®, Xatral® and Nasacort®in the U.S. Eloxatine® in the U.S. is a special case. This product was subject to generic competition for part of 2010 until a court ruling prevented further sales of unauthorized generics from June 2010 until August 9, 2012. In 2012, aggregate consolidated net sales generated by all the products in countries where generic competition currently exists or is expected in 2013 (excluding Plavix® and Avapro® in the U.S., and industrial sales of these two products worldwide) were €2,996 million, including €1,221 million in the U.S., €880 million in Europe and € 92 895 million in Japan (Allegra®, Myslee® and Taxotere®). The negative impact on our 2013 net sales is liable to represent a substantial portion of this amount, but the actual impact will depend on a number of factors such as the actual launch dates of generic products in 2013, the prices at which they are sold, and potential litigation outcomes. In addition, the loss of Plavix® and Avapro® exclusivity in the U.S. in the first half of 2012 is expected to negatively impact our net income by €0.8 billion in 2013 relative to 2012. Although sales of Plavix® and Avapro® in the U.S. are not included in our consolidated net sales, these products nonetheless have an impact on our net income (see " Financial Presentation of Alliances  Alliance Arrangements with Bristol-Myers Squibb" below for further explanations). Purchase Accounting Effects Our results of operations and financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2012, December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 have been significantly affected by our August 2004 acquisition of Aventis and certain subsequent transactions, mainly our acquisition of Genzyme on April 4, 2011. The Aventis acquisition has given rise to significant amortization (€1,489 million in 2012, €1,788 million in 2011, and €3,070 million in 2010) and impairment of intangible assets (reversals of €12 million in 2012 and of €34 million in 2011, and charges of €127 million in 2010). The Genzyme acquisition has also given rise to amortization of intangible assets (€981 million in 2012 and €709 million in 2011) and impairment of intangible assets (€25 million in 2012 and €119 million in 2011). In order to isolate the purchase accounting effects of all acquisitions and certain other items, we use a non-GAAP financial measure that we refer to as "business net income". For a further discussion and definition of "business net income", see " Business Net Income" below. Business net income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 is presented in " Business Net Income" below. Sources of Revenues and Expenses Revenue. Revenue arising from the sale of goods is presented in the income statement under "Net sales". Net sales comprise revenue from sales of pharmaceutical products, human vaccines, animal health products and active ingredients, net of sales returns, of customer incentives and discounts, and of certain sales-based payments paid or payable to the healthcare authorities. Returns, discounts, incentives and rebates described above are recognized in the period in which the underlying sales are recognized, as a reduction of sales revenue. See Note B.14. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. We sell pharmaceutical products and human vaccines directly, through alliances, and through licensees throughout the world. When we sell products directly, we record sales revenues as part of our consolidated net sales. When we sell products through alliances, the revenues reflected in our consolidated financial statements are based on the overall level of sales of the products and on the arrangements governing those alliances. For more information about our alliances, see " Financial Presentation of Alliances" below. When we sell products through licensees, we receive royalty income that we record in "Other revenues". See Note C. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Cost of Sales. Our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of purchasing active ingredients and raw materials, labor and other costs relating to our manufacturing activities, packaging materials, payments made under licensing agreements and distribution costs. We have license agreements under which we distribute products that are patented by other companies and license agreements under which other companies distribute products that we have patented. When we pay royalties, we record them in cost of sales, and when we receive royalties, we record them in "Other revenues" as discussed above. Operating Income. Our operating income reflects our revenues, our cost of sales and the remainder of our operating expenses, the most significant of which are research and development expenses and selling and general expenses. For our business segments, we also measure our results of operations through an indicator referred to as "Business Operating Income," which we describe below under " Segment Information  Business Operating Income of Segments." 93 Segment Information Operating Segments In accordance with IFRS 8 "Operating Segments," we have defined our segments as "Pharmaceuticals", "Human Vaccines" (Vaccines) and "Animal Health". Our other identified segments are categorized as "Other". The Pharmaceuticals segment covers research, development, production and marketing of medicines, including activities acquired with Genzyme. Sanofi's pharmaceuticals portfolio consists of flagship products, plus a broad range of prescription medicines, generic medicines, and consumer health products. This segment also includes all associates and joint ventures whose activities are related to pharmaceuticals, in particular the entities majority owned by BMS. See " Financial Presentation of Alliances" below. The Vaccines segment is wholly dedicated to vaccines, including research, development, production and marketing. This segment includes our Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture with Merck & Co., Inc. in Europe. The Animal Health segment comprises the research, development, production and marketing activities of Merial, which offers a complete range of medicines and vaccines for a wide variety of animal species. The Other segment includes all activities that do not qualify as reportable segments under IFRS 8 "Operating Segments". In particular, this segment included our interest in the Yves Rocher group until the date of loss of significant influence (November 2011) (see note D.6. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report); it also includes the effects of retained commitments in respect of divested businesses. Inter-segment transactions are not material. Business Operating Income of Segments We report segment results on the basis of "Business Operating Income". This indicator, adopted in compliance with IFRS 8, is used internally to measure operational performance and to allocate resources. "Business Operating Income" is derived from "Operating income", adjusted as follows: the amounts reported in the line items "Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities", "Restructuring costs" and "Other gains and losses, and litigation" are eliminated; amortization and impairment losses charged against intangible assets (other than software) are eliminated; the share of profits/losses of associates and joint ventures is added; the share attributable to non-controlling interests is deducted; other acquisition-related effects (primarily, the workdown of acquired inventories remeasured at fair value at the acquisition date, and the impact of acquisitions on investments in associates and joint ventures) are eliminated; and restructuring costs relating to associates and joint ventures are eliminated. 94 The following table presents our Business Operating Income for the year ended December 31, 2012.

(4) See Note D.28. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Business Net Income In addition to net income, we use a non-GAAP financial measure that we refer to as "business net income" to evaluate our Group's performance. Business net income, which is defined below, represents the aggregate business operating income of all of our operating segments, less net financial expenses and the relevant income tax effects. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure allows investors to understand the performance of our Group because it segregates the results of operations of our current business activities, as opposed to reflecting the impact of past transactions such as acquisitions. Our management uses business net income to manage and to evaluate our performance, and we believe it is appropriate to disclose this non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplement to our IFRS reporting, in order to assist investors in analyzing the factors and trends affecting our business performance. Our management also intends to use business net income as the basis for proposing the dividend policy for the Group. Accordingly, management believes that an investor's understanding of trends in our dividend policy is enhanced by disclosing business net income. We have also decided to report "business earnings per share". Business earnings per share is a specific non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as business net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Our management intends to give earnings guidance based on business earnings per share. We also present business earnings per share on a diluted basis. Business net income is defined as "Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi", determined under IFRS, excluding (i) amortization of intangible assets; (ii) impairment of intangible assets; (iii) fair value 96 remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities; (iv) other impacts associated with acquisitions (including impacts of acquisitions on associates and joint ventures); (v) restructuring costs (including restructuring costs relating to associates and joint ventures); (vi) other gains and losses, and litigation; (vii) the impact of the non-depreciation of the property, plant and equipment of Merial starting September 18, 2009 and continuing through 2010 (in accordance with IFRS 5); (viii) the tax effect related to the items listed in (i) through (vii); as well as (ix) effects of major tax disputes and, as an exception for 2011, the retroactive effect (2006-2010) on the tax liability resulting from the agreement signed on December 22, 2011 by France and the United States on transfer prices (APA-Advance Pricing Agreement), for which the amount is deemed to be significant, and (x) the share of non-controlling interests in items (i) through (ix). Items (i), (ii), (iii), (v) and (vi) correspond to those reported in the income statement line items "Amortization of intangible assets", "Impairment of intangible assets", "Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities", "Restructuring costs" and "Other gains and losses, and litigation", as defined in Notes B.19. and B.20. to our consolidated financial statements. The following table reconciles our business net income to our Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010: (€ million) 2012 2011 2010 Business net income 8,179 8,795 9,215 (i) Amortization of intangible assets (3,291 ) (3,314 ) (3,529 ) (ii) Impairment of intangible assets (117 ) (142 ) (433 ) (iii) Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities (192 ) 15  (iv) Expenses arising from the impact of acquisitions on inventories (1) (23 ) (476 ) (142 ) (v) Restructuring costs (1,141 ) (1,314 ) (1,384 ) (vi) Other gains and losses, and litigation (2)  (327 ) (138 ) (vii) Impact of the non-depreciation of the property, plant and equipment of Merial (IFRS 5)   77 (viii) Tax effects on the items listed above, comprising: 1,580 1,905 1,856  amortization of intangible assets 1,159 1,178 1,183  impairment of intangible assets 42 37 143  fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities 2 34   expenses arising from the impact of acquisitions on inventories 7 143 44  restructuring costs 370 399 466  other gains and losses, and litigation  114 46  non-depreciation of property, plant and equipment of Merial (IFRS 5)   (26 ) (iv)/(ix) Other tax items (3)  577  (x) Share of items listed above attributable to non-controlling interests 3 6 3 (iv)/(v) Restructuring costs and expenses arising from the impact of acquisitions on associates and joint ventures (4) (31 ) (32 ) (58 ) Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi 4,967 5,693 5,467 (1) This line comprises the workdown of inventories remeasured at fair value at the acquisition date. (2) See Note D.28. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. (3) In 2011, this line item includes €349 million relating to the effect of the Franco-American Advance Pricing Agreement (APA), and a €228 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities on remeasurements of intangible assets of Merial as a result of changes in tax legislation in the United Kingdom. (4) This line shows the portion of major restructuring costs incurred by associates and joint ventures, and expenses arising from the impact of acquisitions on associates and joint ventures (workdown of acquired inventories, amortization and impairment of intangible assets, and impairment of goodwill). 97 The following table sets forth the calculation of our business net income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010: (€ million) 2012 2011 2010 Business operating income 11,353 12,144 12,863 Financial income and expenses (460 ) (412 ) (362 ) Income tax expense (2,714 ) (2,937 ) (3,286 ) Business net income 8,179 8,795 9,215 The most significant reconciliation items in the table above relate to the purchase accounting effect of our acquisitions, particularly the amortization and impairment of intangible assets. We believe that excluding these non-cash charges enhances an investor's understanding of our underlying economic performance because we do not consider that the excluded charges reflect the combined entity's ongoing operating performance. Rather, we believe that each of the excluded charges reflects the decision to acquire the businesses concerned. The purchase-accounting effects on net income primarily relate to: charges to cost of sales resulting from the workdown of acquired inventories remeasured at fair value, net of tax; charges related to the impairment of goodwill; and charges related to the amortization and impairment of intangible assets, net of tax and non-controlling interests. We believe (subject to the limitations described below) that disclosing business net income enhances the comparability of our operating performance, for the following reasons: the elimination of charges related to the purchase accounting effect of our acquisitions (particularly amortization and impairment of finite-lived intangible assets) enhances the comparability of our ongoing operating performance relative to our peers in the pharmaceutical industry that carry these intangible assets (principally patents and trademarks) at low book values either because they are the result of in-house research and development that has already been expensed in prior periods or because they were acquired through business combinations that were accounted for as poolings-of-interest; the elimination of selected items, such as the increase in cost of sales arising from the workdown of inventories remeasured at fair value, gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets and costs and provisions associated with major litigation, improves comparability from one period to the next; and the elimination of restructuring costs relating to the implementation of our transformation strategy enhances comparability because these costs are directly, and only, incurred in connection with transformation processes such as the rationalization of our research and development structures. We remind investors, however, that business net income should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi reported in accordance with IFRS. In addition, we strongly encourage investors and potential investors not to rely on any single financial measure but to review our financial statements, including the notes thereto, and our other publicly filed reports, carefully and in their entirety. There are material limitations associated with the use of business net income as compared to the use of IFRS net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi in evaluating our performance, as described below: The results presented by business net income cannot be achieved without incurring the following costs that the measure excludes: Amortization of intangible assets. Business net income excludes the amortization charges related to intangible assets. Most of these amortization charges relate to intangible assets that we have acquired. Although amortization is a non-cash charge, it is important for investors to consider it because it represents an allocation in each reporting period of a portion of the purchase price that we 98 paid for certain intangible assets that we have acquired through acquisitions. For example, in connection with our acquisition of Aventis in 2004, we paid an aggregate of €31,279 million for these amortizable intangible assets (which, in general, were to be amortized over their useful lives, representing an average amortization period of eight years) and €5,007 million for in-progress research & development. More recently, in connection with our acquisition of Genzyme in April 2011, we paid an aggregate of €7,877 million for amortizable intangible assets (average amortization period of eight and a half years) and €2,148 million for in-progress research & development. A large part of our revenues could not be generated without owning acquired intangible assets. Restructuring costs. Business net income does not reflect restructuring costs even though it does reflect the benefits of the optimization of our activities, such as our research and development activities, much of which we could not achieve in the absence of restructuring costs. In addition, the results presented by business net income are intended to represent the Group's underlying performance, but items such as gains and losses on disposals and provisions associated with major litigation may recur in future years. We compensate for the above-described material limitations by using business net income only to supplement our IFRS financial reporting and by ensuring that our disclosures provide sufficient information for a full understanding of all adjustments included in business net income. In addition, subject to applicable law, we may in the future decide to report additional non-GAAP financial measures which, in combination with business net income, may compensate further for some of the material limitations described above. In determining the level of future dividend payments, and in analyzing dividend policy on the basis of business net income, our management intends to take into account the fact that many of the adjustments reflected in business net income have no effect on the underlying amount of cash available to pay dividends. However, although the adjustments relating to the elimination of the effect of the purchase accounting treatment of the Aventis acquisition and other acquisitions represent non-cash charges, the adjustments relating to restructuring costs represent significant cash charges in the periods following the closing of the acquisition. This Item 5 contains a discussion and analysis of business net income on the basis of consolidated financial data. Because our business net income is not a standardized measure, it may not be comparable with the non-GAAP financial measures of other companies using the same or a similar non-GAAP financial measure. Presentation of Net Sales In the discussion below, we present our consolidated net sales for 2012, 2011 and 2010. We break down our net sales among various categories, including by business segment, product and geographic region. We refer to our consolidated net sales as "reported" sales. In addition to reported sales, we analyze non-GAAP financial measures designed to isolate the impact on our net sales of currency exchange rates and changes in group structure. When we refer to changes in our net sales "at constant exchange rates", we exclude the effect of exchange rates by recalculating net sales for the relevant period using the exchange rates that were used for the previous period. See Note B.2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information relating to the manner in which we translate into euros transactions recorded in other currencies. When we refer to our net sales on a "constant structure basis", we eliminate the effect of changes in structure by restating the net sales for the previous period as follows: by including sales from an entity or with respect to product rights acquired in the current period for a portion of the previous period equal to the portion of the current period during which we owned them, based on sales information we receive from the party from whom we made the acquisition; similarly, by excluding sales for a portion of the previous period when we have sold an entity or rights to a product in the current period; and 99 for a change in consolidation method, by recalculating the previous period on the basis of the method used for the current period. A reconciliation of our reported net sales to our net sales at constant exchange rates is provided at " Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2011  Net Sales" and at " Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2010  Net Sales" below. Financial Presentation of Alliances We have entered into a number of alliances for the development, co-promotion and/or co-marketing of our products. We believe that a presentation of our two principal alliances is useful to an understanding of our financial statements. The financial impact of the alliances on the Company's income statement is described in " Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2011" and " Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2010", in particular in " Net sales", " Other Revenues", " Share of Profit/Loss of Associates and Joint Ventures" and " Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests". Alliance Arrangements with Bristol-Myers Squibb Our revenues, expenses and operating income are affected significantly by the presentation of our alliance with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) in our consolidated financial statements. On September 27, 2012 Sanofi and BMS restructured their alliance following the loss of exclusivity of Plavix® and Avapro®/Avalide® in many major markets. Under the terms of the revised agreement, which came into effect on January 1, 2013, BMS has returned to Sanofi its rights to Plavix® and Avapro®/Avalide® in all markets worldwide with the exception of Plavix® in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, giving Sanofi sole control and freedom to operate commercially. In exchange, starting January 1, 2013 BMS will receive royalty payments on Sanofi's sales of branded and unbranded Plavix® worldwide, excluding the U.S. and Puerto Rico, and on sales of branded and unbranded Avapro®/Avalide® worldwide, in each case through 2018; BMS will also receive a terminal payment of $200 million from Sanofi in December 2018. Plavix® rights in the U.S. and Puerto Rico will continue unchanged under the terms of the existing agreement through December 2019. In addition, under the terms of this new agreement ongoing disputes between the companies related to the alliance have been resolved. The resolution of these disputes includes various commitments by both companies, including a one-time payment of $80 million by BMS to Sanofi in relation to the Avalide® supply disruption in the U.S. in 2011. As of December 31, 2012, there are three principal marketing arrangements that are used: Co-marketing. Under the co-marketing system, each company markets the products independently under its own brand names. We record our own sales and related costs in our consolidated financial statements. Exclusive Marketing. Under the exclusive marketing system, one company has the exclusive right to market the products. We record our own sales and related costs in our consolidated financial statements. Co-promotion. Under the co-promotion system, the products are marketed through the alliance arrangements (either by contractual arrangements or by separate entities) under a single brand name. The accounting treatment of the co-promotion agreement depends upon who has majority ownership and operational management in that territory, as discussed below. 100 The alliance arrangements as of December 31, 2012 include two royalty streams that are applied on a worldwide basis (excluding Japan and other opt out countries), regardless of the marketing system and regardless of which company has majority ownership and operational management: Discovery Royalty. As inventor of the two molecules, we earn an adjustable discovery royalty on part of Aprovel®/Avapro®/Karvea®/Karvezide® and Plavix®/Iscover® sold in alliance countries regardless of the marketing system. The discovery royalty earned in territories under operational management of BMS is reflected in our consolidated income statement in "Other revenues." Development Royalty. In addition to the discovery royalty, we and BMS are each entitled to a development royalty related to certain know-how and other intellectual property in connection with sales of Aprovel®/Avapro®/Karvea®/Karvezide® and Plavix®/Iscover®. We record development royalties paid to BMS in our consolidated income statement as an increase to our cost of sales in countries where we consolidate sales of the products. We record development royalties that we receive as "other revenues" in countries where BMS consolidates sales of the products. Under the alliance arrangements as of December 31, 2012, there are two territories, one under our operational management and the other under the operational management of BMS. The territory under our operational management consists of Europe and most of Africa and Asia, while the territory under the operational management of BMS consists of the rest of the world (excluding Japan). In Japan, Aprovel® has been marketed jointly by Shionogi Pharmaceuticals and Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd since June 2008. Our alliance with BMS does not cover distribution rights to Plavix® in Japan, which is marketed by Sanofi. Territory under our operational management. In the territory under our operational management, the marketing arrangements and recognition of operations by the Group are as follows: we use the co-promotion system for most of the countries in Western Europe for Aprovel®/Avapro®/Karvea®/Karvezide® and Plavix®/Iscover® and for certain Asian countries for Plavix®/Iscover®. We record 100% of all alliance revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We also record, as selling and general expenses, payments to BMS for the cost of BMS's personnel involved in the promotion of the products. BMS's share of the operating income of the alliances is recorded as "non-controlling interests"; we use the co-marketing system in Germany, Spain and Greece for both Aprovel®/Avapro®/Karvea®/Karvezide® and Plavix®/Iscover® and in Italy for Aprovel®/Avapro®/Karvea®/Karvezide®; and we have the exclusive right to market Aprovel®/Avapro®/Karvea®/Karvezide® and Plavix®/Iscover® in Eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and certain Asian countries (excluding Japan); we have the exclusive right to market Aprovel® in Scandinavia and Ireland, and Plavix® in Malaysia. Territory under BMS operational management. In the territory under BMS operational management, the marketing arrangements and recognition of operations by the Group are as follows: we use the co-promotion system in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, where the products are sold through the alliances under the operational management of BMS. With respect to Avapro® (the brand name used in the United States for Aprovel®) and Plavix®, we record our share of the alliance's operating income under "share of profit/loss of associates and joint ventures". We also record payments from BMS for the cost of our personnel in connection with the promotion of the product as a deduction from our selling and general expenses; we use the co-marketing system in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Australia for Plavix®/Iscover® and Aprovel®/Avapro®/Karvea®/Karvezide® and in Colombia for Plavix®/Iscover®; and we have the exclusive right to market the products in certain other countries of Latin America. In countries where the products are marketed by BMS on a co-marketing basis, or through alliances under the operational management of BMS, we also earn revenues from the sale of the active ingredients for the products to BMS or such entities, which we record as "Net sales" in our consolidated income statement. 101 Alliance Arrangements with Regeneron Our relationship with Regeneron began in 2003 with an agreement for the co-development of the anti-angiogenic agent Zaltrap®. We expanded our relationship in 2007 and created a strategic R&D collaboration on fully human monoclonal antibodies. Collaboration agreement on Zaltrap® (aflibercept) Zaltrap® (aflibercept) is a solution administered by intravenous perfusion, used in association with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as a treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. In September 2003, Sanofi and Regeneron signed an agreement to collaborate on the development and commercialization of Zaltrap®. Under the terms of this agreement (as amended in 2005), Sanofi is responsible for funding 100% of the development costs, co-promotion rights are shared between Sanofi and Regeneron, and the profits generated from sales of Zaltrap® worldwide (except Japan) are shared equally. Sales of Zaltrap® made by subsidiaries under the control of Sanofi are recognized in consolidated net sales, and the associated costs incurred by those subsidiaries are recognized as operating expenses in the consolidated income statement. Regeneron's share of the profits is recognized in the line item "Other operating expenses", a component of operating income. Under the terms of the same agreement, Regeneron agreed to repay 50% of the development costs initially funded by Sanofi. Contractually, this amount represents 5% of the residual repayment obligation per quarter, but may not exceed Regeneron's profit share for the quarter unless Regeneron voluntarily decides to make a larger payment in a given quarter. The agreement also stipulates milestone payments to be made by Sanofi on receipt of specified marketing approvals for Zaltrap® in the United States, within the European Union and in Japan. In the United States, Zaltrap® is a registered trademark of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The product was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in August 2012, and has been marketed in the United States since that date. On February 5, 2013, the European Commission granted marketing authorization in the European Union for Zaltrap®. Regeneron has not elected to co-promote Zaltrap® at launch in the major market countries defined as United States, France, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Germany and Canada. In Japan, Sanofi will develop and commercialize Zaltrap®, with Regeneron entitled to receive a royalty. Collaboration agreement on the discovery, development and commercialization of human therapeutic antibodies In November 2007, Sanofi and Regeneron signed additional agreements under which Sanofi committed to funding the development costs of Regeneron's human monoclonal antibody research program until 2017, up to a maximum of $160 million a year (see Note D.21. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report). Sanofi has an option to license for further development any antibodies discovered by Regeneron that attain Investigational New Drug (IND) status. If such an option is exercised, Sanofi is primarily responsible for funding, and co-develops the antibody with Regeneron. Sanofi and Regeneron would share co-promotion rights and profits on sales of the co-developed antibodies. Development costs for the drug candidate are shared between the companies, with Sanofi generally funding these costs up front, except that following receipt of the first positive Phase III trial results for a co-developed drug candidate, subsequent Phase III trial-related costs for that drug candidate are shared 80% by Sanofi and 20% by Regeneron. Once a product begins to be marketed, Regeneron will progressively repay out of its profits 50% of the development costs borne by Sanofi for all antibodies licensed by Sanofi. However, Regeneron are not required to apply more than 10% of its share of the profits from collaboration products in any calendar quarter towards reimbursing Sanofi for these development costs. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Sanofi may also be required to make milestone payments based on aggregate sales of antibodies. In 2012, six antibodies were in clinical development; two of which were in Phase III. 102 If Sanofi does not exercise its licensing option for an antibody under development, Sanofi will be entitled to receive a royalty once the antibody begins to be marketed. Alliance arrangements with Warner Chilcott (previously with Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals) Our agreement with Warner Chilcott ("the Alliance Partner") covers the worldwide development and marketing arrangements of Actonel®, except Japan for which we hold no rights. Until October 30, 2009, this agreement was between Sanofi and Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals (P&G). Since the sale by P&G of its pharmaceutical business to Warner Chilcott on October 30, 2009, Actonel® has been marketed in collaboration with Warner Chilcott. The local marketing arrangements may take various forms. Co-promotion, whereby sales resources are pooled but only one of the two parties to the alliance agreement (Sanofi or the Alliance Partner) invoices product sales. Co-promotion is carried out under contractual agreements and is not based on any specific legal entity. The Alliance Partner sells the product and incurs all of the related costs in France and Canada. This co-promotion scheme formerly included Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg until December 31, 2007, the Netherlands until March 31, 2008, and the United States and Puerto Rico until March 31, 2010. We recognize our share of revenues under the agreement in our income statement as a component of operating income in the line item "Other operating income". Since April 1, 2010, we have received royalties from the Alliance Partner on sales made by the Alliance Partner in the United States and Puerto Rico. In the secondary co-promotion territories (the United Kingdom until December 31, 2008, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Greece, Switzerland, Austria, Portugal and Australia), we sell the product and recognize all the revenues from sales of the product along with the corresponding expenses. The share due to the Alliance Partner is recognized in "Cost of sales"; Co-marketing, which applies in Italy, whereby each party to the alliance agreement sells the product in the country under its own brand name, and recognizes all revenues and expenses from its own operations in its respective income statement. Each company also markets the product independently under its own brand name in Spain, although Spain is not included in the co-marketing territory; Warner Chilcott only territories: the product has been marketed by the Alliance Partner independently in Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg since January 1, 2008, in the Netherlands since April 1, 2008 and in the United Kingdom since January 1, 2009. We recognize our share of revenues under the alliance agreement in "Other operating income"; and Sanofi only territories: we have exclusive rights to sell the product in all other territories. We recognize all revenues and expenses from our own operations in our income statement, but in return for these exclusive rights we pay the Alliance Partner a royalty based on actual sales. This royalty is recognized in "Cost of sales". In 2010, Sanofi and Warner Chilcott began negotiations on the future of their alliance arrangements. In an arbitration proceeding, an arbitration panel decided on July 14, 2011 that the termination by Warner Chilcott of an ancillary agreement did not lead to the termination of the Actonel® Alliance. Pursuant to this decision, the alliance will remain in effect until January 1, 2015. Impact of Exchange Rates We report our consolidated financial statements in euros. Because we earn a significant portion of our revenues in countries where the euro is not the local currency, our results of operations can be significantly affected by exchange rate movements between the euro and other currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese yen, and currencies in emerging countries. We experience these effects even though certain of these countries do not account for a large portion of our net sales. In 2012, we earned 31.1% of our net sales in the United States. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against the euro has a negative impact on our revenues, which is not offset by an equal reduction in our costs and therefore negatively affects our operating income. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar has a particularly significant impact on our operating income, which is higher in the United States than elsewhere, and on the contribution to net income of our alliance with BMS in the United States, which is 103 under the operational management of BMS, as described at " Financial Presentation of Alliances  Alliance arrangements with Bristol-Myers Squibb" above. For a description of positions entered into to manage operational foreign exchange risks as well as our hedging policy, see "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk", and "Item 3. Key Information  D. Risk Factors  Risks Related to Financial Markets  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition". Divestments In August 2012, Sanofi sold its 39.1% interest in Société Financière des Laboratoires de Cosmétologie Yves Rocher, in line with the Group's desire to focus on strategic activities. In December 2011 Sanofi sold the Dermik dermatology business to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., for €321 million (see Note D.1.3. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report). There were no material divestments in 2010. Acquisitions The principal acquisitions during 2012 are described below: In April 2012, Sanofi strengthened its presence in biosurgery by acquiring a 100% equity interest in Pluromed, Inc. (Pluromed), an American medical devices company. Pluromed has developed a proprietary polymer technology  Rapid Transition Polymers (RTP)  pioneering the use of plugs that can be injected into blood vessels to improve the safety, efficacy and economics of medical interventions. In March 2012, Merial (Sanofi's Animal Health division) completed the acquisition of Newport Laboratories, a privately held company based in Worthington, Minnesota (United States), which is a leader in autogenous vaccines for the bovine and swine markets. The impact of these two acquisitions on our consolidated financial statements is not material. In October 2012, Sanofi signed an agreement to acquire Genfar S.A. (Genfar), a Colombian pharmaceutical company that is a major player in Colombia and other countries in Latin America. Genfar is the second-largest generics manufacturer in Colombia by sales, and the leader by volumes sold.

In November 2011, Sanofi acquired the business of Universal Medicare Private Limited (Universal), a major producer of nutraceuticals in India. An upfront payment of €83 million was made on completion of the transaction. See Note D.1.2. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. In December 2011, Sanofi co-invested in Warp Drive Bio, an innovative start-up biotechnology company, along with two venture capital firms, Third Rock Ventures (TRV) and Greylock Partners. Warp Drive Bio is an innovative biotechnology company, focusing on proprietary genomic technology to discover drugs of natural origin. Sanofi and TRV / Greylock have invested in Warp Drive Bio at parity. Total program funding over the first five years could amount to up to $125 million, including an equity investment of up to $75 million. The principal acquisitions during 2010 are described below: In February 2010, Sanofi acquired the U.S.-based company Chattem, Inc. (Chattem) by successfully completing a cash tender offer leading to the acquisition of 100% of the share capital. Chattem is a major consumer health player in the United States, producing and distributing branded consumer health products, toiletries and dietary supplements across various market segments. Chattem manages the Allegra® brand, and acts as the platform for Sanofi over-the-counter and consumer healthcare products in the United States. See Note D.1.4. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. In April 2010, Sanofi acquired a controlling interest in the capital of Bioton Vostok, a Russian insulin manufacturer. Under the terms of the agreement, put options were granted to non-controlling interests. See Note D.18. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. In May 2010, Sanofi formed a new joint venture with Nichi-Iko Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd (Nichi-Iko), a leading generics company in Japan, to expand generics activities in the country. In addition to forming this joint venture, Sanofi took a 4.66% equity interest in the capital of Nichi-Iko. In June 2010, Sanofi acquired 100% of the share capital of Canderm Pharma Inc.

Our consolidated income statements include the results of the operations of Genzyme from April 2011. In order to help investors gain a better understanding of our performances, in the narrative discussion of certain income statement line items ("net sales", "research & development expenses", and "selling & general expenses"), we include non-consolidated 2011 first-quarter data for Genzyme in additional analyses. 106 Net Sales Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 amounted to €34,947 million, up 4.7% on 2011. Exchange rate movements had a favorable effect of 4.2 points, mainly reflecting the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro, and to a lesser extent the appreciation of the yen and the yuan. At constant exchange rates and after taking account of changes in structure (mainly the consolidation of Genzyme from April 2011), net sales rose by 0.5% year-on-year. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our reported net sales for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 to our net sales at constant exchange rates: (€ million) 2012 2011 Change (%) Net sales 34,947 33,389 +4.7% Effect of exchange rates (1,400 ) Net sales at constant exchange rates 33,547 33,389 +0.5% Our net sales comprise the net sales generated by our Pharmaceuticals, Human Vaccines (Vaccines) and Animal Health segments. The following table breaks down our 2012 and 2011 net sales by business segment: (€ million) 2012 Reported 2011 Reported Change on a reported basis (%) Change at constant exchange rates (%) Pharmaceuticals 28,871 27,890 +3.5% -0.4% Vaccines 3,897 3,469 +12.3% +5.7% Animal Health 2,179 2,030 +7.3% +3.1% Total 34,947 33,389 +4.7% +0.5% Net Sales by Product  Pharmaceuticals segment Net sales generated by our Pharmaceuticals segment were €28,871 million in 2012, up 3.5% on a reported basis but down 0.4% at constant exchange rates. The year-on-year change reflects the positive impact of consolidating Genzyme from April 2011 and the performance of growth platforms, but also the negative effects of generic competition (mainly on sales of Lovenox®, Taxotere® and Eloxatine® in the United States, and of Taxotere®, Plavix® and Aprovel® in Western Europe), the ending of the co-promotion agreement with Teva on Copaxone®, the divestiture of the Dermik business in July 2011, and austerity measures in the European Union. On a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates (which primarily means including the non-consolidated sales of Genzyme for the first quarter of 2011 and excluding sales of Copaxone® for the whole of 2011), net sales for the Pharmaceuticals segment fell by 0.6% in 2012. Our flagship products (Lantus® and Apidra®, Lovenox®, Plavix®, Aprovel®/CoAprovel®, Taxotere®, Eloxatine®, Cerezyme®, Myozyme®/Lumizyme®, Fabrazyme®, Renagel®/Renvela®, Synvisc®/Synvisc-One®, Multaq®, Jevtana®, Aubagio® and Zaltrap®) are discussed below. Sales of Plavix® and Aprovel® are discussed further below under " Worldwide Presence of Plavix® and Aprovel®". 107 The following table breaks down our 2012 and 2011 net sales for the Pharmaceuticals segment by product: (€ million) Product Indication 2012 Reported 2011 Reported Change on a reported basis (%) Change at constant exchange rates (%) Lantus® Diabetes 4,960 3,916 +26.7% +19.3% Apidra® Diabetes 230 190 +21.1% +16.8% Amaryl® Diabetes 421 436 -3.4% -8.0% Insuman® Diabetes 135 132 +2.3% +3.0% Other diabetes products Diabetes 36 10 +260.0% +250.0% Total: Diabetes Diabetes 5,782 4,684 +23.4% +16.7% Eloxatin® Colorectal cancer 956 1,071 -10.7% -17.3% Taxotere® Breast, lung, prostate, stomach, and head & neck cancer 563 922 -38.9% -41.9% Jevtana® Prostate cancer 235 188 +25.0% +20.2% Zaltrap® Colorectal cancer 25    Mozobil® (1) Hematologic malignancies 96 59   Other oncology products (1) 519 389   Total: Oncology 2,394 2,629 -8.9% -14.3% Lovenox® Thrombosis 1,893 2,111 -10.3% -12.0% Plavix® Atherothrombosis 2,066 2,040 +1.3% -4.6% Aprovel®/CoAprovel® Hypertension 1,151 1,291 -10.8% -13.3% Allegra® Allergic rhinitis, urticaria 553 580 -4.7% -9.5% Stilnox®/Ambien®/Myslee® Sleep disorders 497 490 +1.4% -4.5% Copaxone® Multiple sclerosis 24 436 -94.5% -94.7% Depakine® Epilepsy 410 388 +5.7% +3.1% Tritace® Hypertension 345 375 -8.0% -8.3% Multaq® Atrial fibrillation 255 261 -2.3% -8.0% Xatral® Benign prostatic hypertrophy 130 200 -35.0% -37.0% Actonel® Osteoporosis, Paget's disease 134 167 -19.8% -21.6% Nasacort® Allergic rhinitis 71 106 -33.0% -35.8% Renagel®/Renvela® (1) Hyperphosphatemia 653 415   Synvisc®/Synvisc-One® (1) Arthritis 363 256   Aubagio® Multiple sclerosis 7    Sub-total Multiple sclerosis 7    Cerezyme® (1) Gaucher disease 633 441   Myozyme®/Lumizyme® (1) Pompe disease 462 308   Fabrazyme® (1) Fabry disease 292 109   Other rare disease products (1) 391 264   Sub-total Rare diseases (1) 1,778 1,122   Total: New Genzyme (1) 1,785 1,122   Other prescription products 5,513 5,927 -7.0% -9.1% Consumer Health Care 3,008 2,666 +12.8% +9.9% Generics 1,844 1,746 +5.6% +5.0% Total Pharmaceuticals 28,871 27,890 +3.5% -0.4% (1) In 2011, net sales of Genzyme products were recognized from the acquisition date (April 2011). 108 Diabetes Net sales for the Diabetes business amounted to €5,782 million, up 16.7% at constant exchange rates, driven by strong growth for Lantus®. Lantus® posted a 19.3% increase in net sales at constant exchange rates in 2012 to €4,960 million, driven by very strong growth in the United States (up 22.0% at €3,087 million); in Emerging Markets (up 25.4% at €793 million), especially in China (up 35.9%) and Latin America (up 32.3%); and in Japan (up 22.0%). In Western Europe, growth was a more modest 5.3% at constant exchange rates. Net sales of the rapid-acting insulin analog Apidra® advanced by 16.8% (at constant exchange rates) to €230 million in 2012, buoyed by the product's performance in Emerging Markets (up 37.8%). Amaryl® saw net sales fall by 8.0% at constant exchange rates to €421 million, mainly as a result of competition from generics in Japan (down 31.7%, at €125 million), and in spite of 11.4% growth in Emerging Markets to €263 million. Oncology Net sales for the Oncology business were €2,394 million, down 14.3% at constant exchange rates. Net sales of Eloxatine® fell by 17.3% at constant exchange rates to 956 million in 2012, reflecting the loss of exclusivity in the United States on August 9, 2012, which had been expected. Taxotere® reported a fall in net sales of 41.9% at constant exchange rates, to €563 million. The product is facing competition from generics in Western Europe (down 72.5%) and the United States (down 80.2%). Emerging Markets sales amounted to €270 million, down 11.2% at constant exchange rates. Jevtana® posted net sales of €235 million in 2012, up 20.2% at constant exchange rates, boosted by product launches in various countries in Western Europe (€91 million, up 104.5% at constant exchange rates) and in Emerging Markets. Zaltrap® , launched in the United States and Puerto Rico at the end of August 2012, generated net sales of €25 million for the year. Mozobil® reported net sales of €96 million, up 19.7% on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates (i.e., including non-consolidated sales generated by Genzyme in the first quarter of 2011). Jevtana®, Zaltrap® and Mozobil®, along with Multaq® (see " Other pharmaceutical products" below), form the "Other Innovative Products" growth platform. This platform generated net sales of €611 million in 2012. Other pharmaceutical products Lovenox® recorded a fall in net sales of 12.0% at constant exchange rates to €1,893 million in 2012, as a result of competition from generics in the United States, where sales slipped by 53.1% (at constant exchange rates) to €319 million. Sales generated outside the United States accounted for 83.1% of worldwide net sales and rose by 5.5% at constant exchange rates to €1,574 million, driven by Emerging Markets (up 11.6% at constant exchange rates at €615 million). Sanofi also launched its own generic version of Lovenox® in the United States, sales of which are recognized in the Generics business. Net sales of Renagel®/Renvela® rose by 13.0% on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates (i.e. including non-consolidated sales generated by Genzyme in the first quarter of 2011) to €653 million, on a fine performance in the United States (up 19.2% on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates). Synvisc®/Synvisc-One® reported sales growth of 4.0% on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates (including non-consolidated sales generated by Genzyme in the first quarter of 2011) to €363 million, driven mainly by the Synvisc-One® franchise in the United Sates (€302 million, up 5.7% on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates). 109 Net sales of the Ambien® range fell by 4.5% at constant exchange rates to €497 million, reflecting competition from generics of Ambien® CR in the United States and Western Europe and the introduction of generic versions of Myslee® in Japan during the second half of 2012. Allegra® reported a decline in net sales as a prescription medicine (down 9.5% at constant exchange rates) to €553 million, reflecting lower prices in Japan (down 15.2% at constant exchange rates, at €423 million). This product is sold over the counter in the United States, and has also been available over the counter in Japan since November 2012. Sales over the counter are recognized in the Consumer Health Care business. In August 2012 three generic versions of Allegra® were approved by the regulatory authorities in Japan; since February 2013, Allegra® as a prescription medicine has been subject to generic competition in this country. Net sales of Multaq® fell by 8.0% at constant exchange rates to €255 million, due to the effect of restrictions placed on the product's indication during the second half of 2011. Net sales of Copaxone® amounted to €24 million, versus €436 million in 2011, down 94.7% (at constant exchange rates), reflecting the ending of the co-promotion agreement with Teva in all territories in the first quarter of 2012. Since the transfer of Copaxone® to Teva, we no longer recognize net sales of the product. Instead, for the two years following the transfer we are entitled to receive a payment representing 6% of net sales, which we recognize under the income statement line item "Other revenues". New Genzyme business The new Genzyme business consists of products used to treat rare diseases, and products for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (Aubagio® and the experimental agent Lemtrada). Because Genzyme's net sales have been consolidated from the acquisition date (i.e. the start of April 2011), the 2011 consolidated net sales of the new Genzyme business do not include sales for the first quarter of 2011. On a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates, i.e. after including non-consolidated net sales for the first quarter of 2011, the net sales of the new Genzyme business rose by 16.9% in 2012 to €1,785 million. The following table breaks down our 2012 and 2011 net sales for the new Genzyme business by product: (€ million) Product Indication 2012 Reported 2011 Reported Change on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates (%) Aubagio® Multiple sclerosis 7   Sub-total Multiple sclerosis 7   Cerezyme® (1) Gaucher disease 633 441 +6.0% Myozyme®/Lumizyme® (1) Pompe disease 462 308 +11.4% Fabrazyme® (1) Fabry disease 292 109 +96.4% Other rare disease products (1) 391 264 +7.5% Sub-total Rare diseases (1) 1,778 1,122 +16.4% Total: New Genzyme (1) 1,785 1,122 +16.9% (1) In 2011, net sales of Genzyme products were recognized from the acquisition date (April 2011). Cerezyme® recorded net sales growth of 6.0% on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates, to €633 million (+0.9% in Western Europe, at €215 million; +6.3% in the United States, at €166 million). Production continued to improve during the year, enabling normal doses to be delivered to patients in the product's principal markets Net sales of Myozyme®/Lumizyme® were up 11.4% on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates at €462 million (+10,4% in Western Europe, at €257 million; +6.9% in the United States, at €117 million). 110 Fabrazyme® reported a 96.4% surge in net sales on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates, to €292 million. This increase was due mainly to the resumption of production at the new facility at Framingham (United States) in March 2012, enabling full doses to be supplied in all markets where the product is approved for sale. For more information regarding the manufacturing issues related to Cerezyme® and Fabrazyme® see "Item 4  Information on the Company  Production and Raw Materials." In multiple sclerosis, Aubagio® was launched in the United States in October 2012, and recorded fourth-quarter net sales of €7 million. Consumer Health Care business Net sales for the Consumer Health Care business rose by 9.9% at constant exchange rates in 2012, to €3,008 million. This figure includes revenues generated from the acquisitions made in 2011 (primarily BMP Sunstone in China, and the nutraceuticals business of Universal Medicare in India). In Emerging Markets, net sales advanced by 19.9% at constant exchange rates to €1,478 million. In the United States, sales growth was modest (up 2.2% at constant exchange rates, at €606 million) compared with 2011; this reflects the fact that in the early part of 2011, distributors were building up inventories of the over-the-counter (OTC) version of Allegra®, launched in March 2011. Excluding Allegra® OTC, growth in the United States reached 6.2% at constant exchange rates. Allegra® OTC was also launched in Japan in November 2012. Generics business The Generics business reported net sales of €1,844 million in 2012, a rise of 5.0% at constant exchange rates. The business was boosted by sales growth in the United States (up 42.4% at constant exchange rates, at €272 million), where we launched our own authorized generic versions of Lovenox® and Aprovel®. In Emerging Markets, net sales fell slightly (down 2.7% at constant exchange rates) to €1,045 million, due to the impact of tougher competition and disruptions in the Brazilian market. Net sales of the other prescription products in the portfolio were down 9.1% at constant exchange rates, to €5,513 million. For a description of our other pharmaceutical products, see "
