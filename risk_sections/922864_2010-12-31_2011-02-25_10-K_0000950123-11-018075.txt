Item 1A. Risk Factors The risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this Annual Report, describe certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Our existing and future debt financing could render us unable to operate, result in foreclosure on our properties, prevent us from making distributions on our equity or otherwise adversely affect our liquidity. We are subject to the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, and the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. If we fail to make required payments of principal and interest on secured debt, our lenders could foreclose on the properties and other collateral securing such debt, which would result in loss of income and asset value to us. As of December 31, 2010, substantially all of the properties that we owned or controlled were encumbered by debt. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur, and we have significant amounts of debt outstanding. Payments of principal and interest may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate our properties or pay distributions required to be paid in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing and the cost of available financing and could adversely affect our liquidity. Our ability to obtain financing and the cost of such financing depends on the overall condition of the United States credit markets and, to an important extent, on the level of involvement of certain government sponsored entities, specifically, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, and Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, in secondary credit markets. In recent years, the United States credit markets (outside of multi-family) experienced significant liquidity disruptions, which caused the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably and made obtaining financing, both non-recourse property debt and corporate borrowings, such as our term loan or revolving credit facility, more difficult. During 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA, placed Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae into, and they currently remain under, conservatorship. In February 2011, the Obama Administration presented Congress with a set of proposals regarding the Federal governments future role in the housing finance market, each of which included the winding down of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Freddie Macs and Fannie Maes future relationship with the Federal government and their future role in the financial markets is uncertain. Any significant reduction in Freddie Macs or Fannie Maes level of involvement in the secondary credit markets may adversely affect our ability to obtain non-recourse property debt financing. Additionally, further or prolonged disruptions in the credit markets may also affect our ability to renew our credit facility with similar commitments or the cost of financing when it matures in May 2014 (inclusive of a one year extension option). If our ability to obtain financing is adversely affected, we may be unable to satisfy scheduled maturities on existing financing through other sources of liquidity, which could result in lender foreclosure on the properties securing such debt and loss of income and asset value, each of which would adversely affect our liquidity. 8 Table of Contents Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense and reduce our profitability. As of December 31, 2010, on a consolidated basis, we had approximately $470.3 million of variable-rate indebtedness outstanding and $57.0 million of variable rate preferred stock outstanding. Of the total debt subject to variable interest rates, floating rate tax-exempt bond financing was approximately $374.4 million. Floating rate tax-exempt bond financing is benchmarked against the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Municipal Swap Index, or SIFMA, rate, which since 1989 has averaged 75% of the 30-day LIBOR rate. If this historical relationship continues, we estimate that an increase in 30-day LIBOR of 100 basis points (75 basis points for tax-exempt interest rates) with constant credit risk spreads would result in net income and net income attributable to Aimco common stockholders being reduced (or the amounts of net loss and net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders being increased) by $3.9 million on an annual basis. At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $450.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and notes receivable, a portion of which bear interest at variable rates indexed to LIBOR-based rates, and which may mitigate the effect of an increase in variable rates on our variable-rate indebtedness and preferred stock discussed above. Failure to generate sufficient net operating income may adversely affect our liquidity, limit our ability to fund necessary capital expenditures or adversely affect our ability to pay dividends. Our ability to fund necessary capital expenditures on our properties depends on, among other things, our ability to generate net operating income in excess of required debt payments. If we are unable to fund capital expenditures on our properties, we may not be able to preserve the competitiveness of our properties, which could adversely affect our net operating income. Our ability to make payments to our investors depends on our ability to generate net operating income in excess of required debt payments and capital expenditure requirements. Our net operating income and liquidity may be adversely affected by events or conditions beyond our control, including:  the general economic climate;  an inflationary environment in which the costs to operate and maintain our properties increase at a rate greater than our ability to increase rents which we can only do upon renewal of existing leases or at the inception of new leases;  competition from other apartment communities and other housing options;  local conditions, such as loss of jobs, unemployment rates or an increase in the supply of apartments, that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates;  changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance;  changes in tax laws and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing; and  changes in interest rates and the availability of financing. Covenant restrictions may limit our ability to make payments to our investors. Some of our debt and other securities contain covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. Our credit facility provides, among other things, that we may make distributions to our investors during any four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount that does not exceed the greater of 95% of our Funds From Operations for such period, subject to certain non-cash adjustments, or such amount as may be necessary to maintain our REIT status. Our outstanding classes of preferred stock prohibit the payment of dividends on our Common Stock if we fail to pay the dividends to which the holders of the preferred stock are entitled. 9 Table of Contents Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and cannot always be sold quickly. REIT tax rules also restrict our ability to sell properties. Thus, we may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other market conditions. Our ability to dispose of assets in the future will depend on prevailing economic and market conditions, including the cost and availability of financing. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rents. Our apartment properties compete for residents with other housing alternatives, including other rental apartments, condominiums and single-family homes that are available for rent, as well as new and existing condominiums and single-family homes for sale. Competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartments and to increase or maintain rental rates. Recent challenges in the credit and housing markets have increased housing inventory that competes with our apartment properties. Our subsidiaries may be prohibited from making distributions and other payments to us. All of our properties are owned, and all of our operations are conducted, by the Aimco Operating Partnership and our other subsidiaries. As a result, we depend on distributions and other payments from the Aimco Operating Partnership and our other subsidiaries in order to satisfy our financial obligations and make payments to our investors. The ability of our subsidiaries to make such distributions and other payments depends on their earnings and cash flows and may be subject to statutory or contractual limitations. As an equity investor in our subsidiaries, our right to receive assets upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of their creditors. To the extent that we are recognized as a creditor of such subsidiaries, our claims may still be subordinate to any security interest in or other lien on their assets and to any of their debt or other obligations that are senior to our claims. Redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability. We intend to continue to redevelop certain of our properties. These activities are subject to the following risks:  we may be unable to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, occupancy, or other required governmental or third party permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities;  we may incur costs that exceed our original estimates due to increased material, labor or other costs, such as litigation;  we may be unable to complete construction and lease up of a property on schedule, resulting in increased construction and financing costs and a decrease in expected rental revenues;  occupancy rates and rents at a property may fail to meet our expectations for a number of reasons, including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development by competitors of competing communities;  we may be unable to obtain financing with favorable terms, or at all, for the proposed development of a property, which may cause us to delay or abandon an opportunity;  we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions or increases in construction or financing costs, and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in exploring those opportunities;  we may incur liabilities to third parties during the redevelopment process, for example, in connection with resident lease terminations, or managing existing improvements on the site prior to resident lease terminations; and 10 Table of Contents  loss of a key member of a project team could adversely affect our ability to deliver redevelopment projects on time and within our budget. We are insured for certain risks, and the cost of insurance, increased claims activity or losses resulting from casualty events may affect our operating results and financial condition. We are insured for a portion of our consolidated properties exposure to casualty losses resulting from fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood and other perils, which insurance is subject to deductibles and self-insurance retention. We recognize casualty losses or gains based on the net book value of the affected property and the amount of any related insurance proceeds. In many instances, the actual cost to repair or replace the property may exceed its net book value and any insurance proceeds. We also insure certain unconsolidated properties for a portion of their exposure to such losses. With respect to our consolidated properties, we recognize the uninsured portion of losses as part of casualty losses in the periods in which they are incurred. In addition, we are self-insured for a portion of our exposure to third-party claims related to our employee health insurance plans, workers compensation coverage and general liability exposure. With respect to our insurance obligations to unconsolidated properties and our exposure to claims of third parties, we establish reserves at levels that reflect our known and estimated losses. The ultimate cost of losses and the impact of unforeseen events may vary materially from recorded reserves, and variances may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We purchase insurance to reduce our exposure to losses and limit our financial losses on large individual risks. The availability and cost of insurance are determined by market conditions outside our control. No assurance can be made that we will be able to obtain and maintain insurance at the same levels and on the same terms as we do today. If we are not able to obtain or maintain insurance in amounts we consider appropriate for our business, or if the cost of obtaining such insurance increases materially, we may have to retain a larger portion of the potential loss associated with our exposures to risks. Natural disasters and severe weather may affect our operating results and financial condition. Natural disasters and severe weather such as hurricanes may result in significant damage to our properties. The extent of our casualty losses and loss in operating income in connection with such events is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of exposure in the affected area. When we have geographic concentration of exposures, a single catastrophe (such as an earthquake) or destructive weather event (such as a hurricane) affecting a region may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot accurately predict natural disasters or severe weather, or the number and type of such events that will affect us. As a result, our operating and financial results may vary significantly from one period to the next. Although we anticipate and plan for losses, there can be no assurance that our financial results will not be adversely affected by our exposure to losses arising from natural disasters or severe weather in the future that exceed our previous experience and assumptions. We depend on our senior management. Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, including Terry Considine, our chief executive officer. We have a succession planning and talent development process that is designed to identify potential replacements and develop our team members to provide depth in the organization and a bench of talent on which to draw. However, there are no assurances that we would be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services were no longer available. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not currently maintain key-man life insurance for any of our employees. If we are not successful in our acquisition of properties, our results of operations could be adversely affected. The selective acquisition of properties is a component of our strategy. However, we may not be able to complete transactions successfully in the future. Although we seek to acquire properties when such acquisitions increase our property net operating income, Funds From Operations or Net Asset Value, such transactions may fail to perform in accordance with our expectations. In particular, following acquisition, the value and operational 11 Table of Contents performance of a property may be diminished if obsolescence or neighborhood changes occur before we are able to redevelop or sell the property. We may be subject to litigation associated with partnership transactions that could increase our expenses and prevent completion of beneficial transactions. We have engaged in, and intend to continue to engage in, the selective acquisition of interests in partnerships controlled by us that own apartment properties. In some cases, we have acquired the general partner of a partnership and then made an offer to acquire the limited partners interests in the partnership. In these transactions, we may be subject to litigation based on claims that we, as the general partner, have breached our fiduciary duty to our limited partners or that the transaction violates the relevant partnership agreement or state law. Although we intend to comply with our fiduciary obligations and the relevant partnership agreements, we may incur additional costs in connection with the defense or settlement of this type of litigation. In some cases, this type of litigation may adversely affect our desire to proceed with, or our ability to complete, a particular transaction. Any litigation of this type could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Government housing regulations may limit the opportunities at some of our properties and failure to comply with resident qualification requirements may result in financial penalties and/or loss of benefits, such as rental revenues paid by government agencies. Additionally, the government may cease to operate government housing programs which would result in a loss of benefits. We own consolidated and unconsolidated equity interests in certain properties and manage other properties that benefit from governmental programs intended to provide housing to people with low or moderate incomes. These programs, which are usually administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, or state housing finance agencies, typically provide one or more of the following: mortgage insurance; favorable financing terms; tax-credit equity; or rental assistance payments to the property owners. As a condition of the receipt of assistance under these programs, the properties must comply with various requirements, which typically limit rents to pre-approved amounts and limit our choice of residents to those with incomes at or below certain levels. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in financial penalties or loss of benefits. We are usually required to obtain the approval of HUD in order to acquire or dispose of a significant interest in or manage a HUD-assisted property. We may not always receive such approval. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the government will continue to operate these programs. Any cessation of these government housing programs may result in our loss of the benefits we receive under these programs, including rental subsidies. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, for continuing operations, our rental revenues include $131.4 million, $126.9 million and $119.5 million, respectively, of subsidies from government agencies. Of the 2010 subsidy amounts, approximately 10.7% related to properties subject to housing assistance contracts that expire in 2011, which we anticipate renewing, and the remainder related to properties subject to housing assistance contracts that expire after 2011 and have a weighted average term of 10.8 years. Any loss of these benefits may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Laws benefiting disabled persons may result in our incurrence of unanticipated expenses. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA, all places intended to be used by the public are required to meet certain Federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, or FHAA, requires apartment properties first occupied after March 13, 1991, to comply with design and construction requirements for disabled access. For those projects receiving Federal funds, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 also has requirements regarding disabled access. These and other Federal, state and local laws may require modifications to our properties, or affect renovations of the properties. Noncompliance with these laws could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures. Although we believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with present requirements, we may incur unanticipated expenses to comply with the ADA, the FHAA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in connection with the ongoing operation or redevelopment of our properties. 12 Table of Contents Potential liability or other expenditures associated with potential environmental contamination may be costly. Various Federal, state and local laws subject property owners or operators to liability for management, and the costs of removal or remediation, of certain potentially hazardous materials present on a property, including lead-based paint, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, petroleum-based fuels, and other miscellaneous materials. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such materials. The presence of, or the failure to manage or remedy properly, these materials may adversely affect occupancy at affected apartment communities and the ability to sell or finance affected properties. In addition to the costs associated with investigation and remediation actions brought by government agencies, and potential fines or penalties imposed by such agencies in connection therewith, the improper management of these materials on a property could result in claims by private plaintiffs for personal injury, disease, disability or other infirmities. Various laws also impose liability for the cost of removal, remediation or disposal of these materials through a licensed disposal or treatment facility. Anyone who arranges for the disposal or treatment of these materials is potentially liable under such laws. These laws often impose liability whether or not the person arranging for the disposal ever owned or operated the disposal facility. In connection with the ownership, operation and management of properties, we could potentially be responsible for environmental liabilities or costs associated with our properties or properties we acquire or manage in the future. Moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be costly. Although we are proactively engaged in managing moisture intrusion and preventing the presence of mold at our properties, it is not unusual for mold to be present at some units within the portfolio. We have implemented policies, procedures, third-party audits and training, and include a detailed moisture intrusion and mold assessment during acquisition due diligence. We believe these measures will manage mold exposure at our properties and will minimize the effects that mold may have on our residents. To date, we have not incurred any material costs or liabilities relating to claims of mold exposure or to abate mold conditions. We have only limited insurance coverage for property damage claims arising from the presence of mold and for personal injury claims related to mold exposure. Because the law regarding mold is unsettled and subject to change, we can make no assurance that liabilities resulting from the presence of or exposure to mold will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. We may fail to qualify as a REIT. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income, and we will be subject to Federal income tax at regular corporate rates, including any applicable alternative minimum tax. This would substantially reduce our funds available for distribution to our investors. Unless entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code, we also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT. In addition, our failure to qualify as a REIT would place us in default under our primary credit facilities. We believe that we operate, and have always operated, in a manner that enables us to meet the requirements for qualification as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes. Our continued qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, investment, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we do not obtain independent appraisals. Our compliance with the REIT income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our ability to manage successfully the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. Moreover, the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for Federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the application of the REIT qualification requirements. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, will not contend that our interests in subsidiaries or other issuers constitutes a violation of the REIT requirements. Moreover, future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT, or our Board of Directors may determine to revoke our REIT status. 13 Table of Contents REIT distribution requirements limit our available cash. As a REIT, we are subject to annual distribution requirements, which generally limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. We generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net REIT taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. We intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the requirements of the Code. However, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the Code. Limits on ownership of shares in our charter may result in the loss of economic and voting rights by purchasers that violate those limits. Our charter limits ownership of our Common Stock by any single stockholder (applying certain beneficial ownership rules under the Federal securities laws) to 8.7% (or up to 9.8% upon a waiver from our Board of Directors) of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, or 15% in the case of certain pension trusts, registered investment companies and Mr. Considine. Our charter also limits ownership of our Common Stock and preferred stock by any single stockholder to 8.7% of the value of the outstanding Common Stock and preferred stock, or 15% in the case of certain pension trusts, registered investment companies and Mr. Considine. The charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares of our capital stock if the purchase would result in us losing our REIT status. This could happen if a transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of our shares of capital stock or results in five or fewer persons (applying certain attribution rules of the Code) owning 50% or more of the value of all of our shares of capital stock. If anyone acquires shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the Code for REITs:  the transfer will be considered null and void;  we will not reflect the transaction on our books;  we may institute legal action to enjoin the transaction;  we may demand repayment of any dividends received by the affected person on those shares;  we may redeem the shares;  the affected person will not have any voting rights for those shares; and  the shares (and all voting and dividend rights of the shares) will be held in trust for the benefit of one or more charitable organizations designated by us. We may purchase the shares of capital stock held in trust at a price equal to the lesser of the price paid by the transferee of the shares or the then current market price. If the trust transfers any of the shares of capital stock, the affected person will receive the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the then current market price. An individual who acquires shares of capital stock that violate the above rules bears the risk that the individual:  may lose control over the power to dispose of such shares;  may not recognize profit from the sale of such shares if the market price of the shares increases;  may be required to recognize a loss from the sale of such shares if the market price decreases; and  may be required to repay to us any distributions received from us as a result of his or her ownership of the shares. Our charter may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. The 8.7% ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of delaying or precluding acquisition of control of us by a third party without the consent of our Board of Directors. Our charter authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 510,587,500 shares of capital stock. As of December 31, 2010, 422,157,736 shares were classified as Common Stock, of which 117,642,872 were outstanding, and 88,429,764 shares were classified as preferred stock, 14 Table of Contents of which 24,900,114 were outstanding. Under our charter, our Board of Directors has the authority to classify and reclassify any of our unissued shares of capital stock into shares of capital stock with such preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemptions as our Board of Directors may determine. The authorization and issuance of a new class of capital stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us, even if a change in control were in our stockholders best interests. The Maryland General Corporation Law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. As a Maryland corporation, we are subject to various Maryland laws that may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us and increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if an acquisition would be in our stockholders best interests. The Maryland General Corporation Law, specifically the Maryland Business Combination Act, restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our Board of Directors prior approval. Any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 662/3% of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. The Maryland General Corporation Law, specifically the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act, provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our capital stock representing 10% or more of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. Additionally, the Maryland General Corporation Law provides, among other things, that the board of directors has broad discretion in adopting stockholders rights plans and has the sole power to fix the record date, time and place for special meetings of the stockholders. To date, we have not adopted a shareholders rights plan. In addition, the Maryland General Corporation Law provides that corporations that:  have at least three directors who are not officers or employees of the entity or related to an acquiring person; and  has a class of equity securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, may elect in their charter or bylaws or by resolution of the board of directors to be subject to all or part of a special subtitle that provides that:  the corporation will have a staggered board of directors;  any director may be removed only for cause and by the vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors generally, even if a lesser proportion is provided in the charter or bylaws;  the number of directors may only be set by the board of directors, even if the procedure is contrary to the charter or bylaws;  vacancies may only be filled by the remaining directors, even if the procedure is contrary to the charter or bylaws; and  the secretary of the corporation may call a special meeting of stockholders at the request of stockholders only on the written request of the stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting, even if the procedure is contrary to the charter or bylaws. To date, we have not made any of the elections described above. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. 15 Table of Contents
