Item 1A. RISK FACTORS You should consider carefully the following information about these risks, together with all of the other information contained within this document. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. Risks Related to Our Business We were not profitable for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2008 and may not be able to regain and maintain profitability. We began operations in 1992 and have incurred a loss from operations in each of the years of our existence except for fiscal years 2004 and 2006. As of December 31, 2008, our accumulated deficit was $843.7 million. Our ability to become profitable again will depend on, among other things, the amounts of royalty revenue we receive from our corporate partners; our ability to restructure our existing indebtedness; our ability to maintain and improve sales of our existing product lines; our ability to successfully market and sell certain new products and technologies; our ability to research, develop and successfully launch new products and technologies; our ability to improve our gross profit margins through realization of lower manufacturing costs and efficiencies or improved product sales mix; our ability to effectively control our various operating costs; and foreign currency fluctuations. Our working capital and funding needs may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the level of royalty revenue we receive from corporate partners; our levels of sales and gross profit; costs associated with our manufacturing operations, including capital expenditures, labour and raw materials costs, and our ability to realize manufacturing efficiencies from our various operations; fluctuations in certain working capital items, including inventory and accounts receivable, that may be necessary to support the growth of our business or new product introductions; progress of our research and development programs and costs associated with completing clinical studies and the regulatory process; collaborative and license arrangements with third parties; the cost of filing, prosecuting and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights; expenses associated with litigation; opportunities to in-license complementary te chnologies or potential acquisitions; potential milestone or other payments we may make to licensors or corporate partners; and technological and market developments that impact our royalty revenue, sales levels or competitive position in the marketplace. The sharp reduction in TAXUS royalty payments from BSC, the large amount of our outstanding indebtedness and the related cash interest payments due on such indebtedness, the current economic conditions affecting our and our partners financial stability, as well as the capital expenditures required to develop the medical products segment of our business, among other factors, have magnified our working capital needs and funding shortages. As described below, on March 2, 2009, we announced that we had entered into a senior secured credit facility to provide enhanced liquidity in the near term and to provide us with the flexibility and time to explore longer-term options for our overall capital structure and working capital needs. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesNew Senior Secured Credit Facilities in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These longer-term options include one or more financ ial and strategic alternatives, including a capital influx from one or more new investors and the restructuring of our outstanding indebtedness, but such efforts have not been successful to date due to our significant debt burden. Due to numerous factors that may impact our future cash position, working capital and liquidity as discussed below and the significant cash that will be necessary to continue to service our current level of debt obligations, there can be no assurances that we will have adequate liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our financial obligations beyond 2009. If our cash flows are worse than expected, we may require additional funds in order to meet the funding requirements of our commercial operations for our research and development programs, to satisfy certain contractual obligations, for other operating and capital requirements, for potential acquisitions or in-licensing of technologies, to satisfy milestone or other payment obligations due to licensors or corporate partners, or to repay or refinance our indebtedness. Financing in addition to our new credit facility may not be available, and even if available, may not be available on attractive or acceptable terms due to difficult credit markets and other factors. Our obligation to pay cash interest on our existing debt has had, and we expect will continue to have, an adverse effect on our liquidity. We currently have outstanding $325 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2013 (the Floating Rate Notes) and $250 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 (the Subordinated Notes). We are obligated to make periodic cash interest payments on both the Floating Rate Notes and the Subordinated Notes. Using current interest rates, the annual combined cash interest cost of these notes is $43.1 million. As a result of the cash interest payments we are obligated to make on our outstanding notes, we have had significant liquidity issues. If our cash flows are worse than expected, an inability to access additional sources of liquidity to fund our cash needs beyond 2009, or to refinance our outstanding notes, could further adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt, and could force us to seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws. - 14 - During 2008, we commenced certain cost reductions with the goal of achieving positive consolidated free cash flow (after the incurrence of net interest expense). These efforts may not be sufficient to achieve our goal. If further cost reductions beyond those that are currently scheduled become necessary, our future prospects may be adversely impacted. In September 2008 we announced that we were pursuing various initiatives to reduce operating costs and focus our business efforts on our most promising near term product opportunities. We believe certain cost reduction measures, in addition to a potential financial or strategic transaction of significant magnitude, are concurrently necessary to address potential liquidity issues likely to arise in the near term relating to our current balance sheet structure. We have implemented, and we expect to continue to implement, operating cost reductions across all functions in the company, including in research and development and general and administrative functions, with more limited reduction initiatives in sales and marketing. The cost reduction efforts are designed to reduce certain expenses while maintaining support for the sales our existing marketed product lines. Our remaining resources subsequent to these changes will be focused primarily on our existing Medical Products business, and on selected new products that have recently launched or are expected to be launched in the near future, including Quill SRS, the HemoStream™ Chronic Dialysis Catheter and the Bio-Seal™ Lung Biopsy System. Selected actions that have been taken, or that we expect to take, with respect to the reorganization include postponement of the scheduled launch of our 5-fluorouracil-eluting central venous catheter (5-FU CVC); closure of our resear ch and manufacturing facility in Rochester, New York; postponement of certain pre-clinical-stage research activities, pending the completion of partnering or other funding activities that would offset direct costs and personnel costs associated with such programs; reduction of certain financial and personnel contributions relating to our joint venture with Genzyme Corporation; potential amendment of and reduction in cash outlays related to our collaboration with Athersys, Inc.; rationalization or elimination of office and laboratory space in Vancouver, British Columbia, North Bend, Washington and Herndon, Virginia; rationalization of selected pending and issued intellectual property; elimination of certain expenses and reductions in personnel in all general and administrative and in research and development departments; selective reduction in certain sales and marketing investments personnel and in medical affairs; and postponement of selected planned capital expenditures. Failure to achieve cost reductions through the above or other measures at the rate or levels we expect could adversely affect our ability to achieve our previously stated goal of achieving positive consolidated free cash flow (after the incurrence of net interest expense). If we are required to make further reductions to our expense levels beyond those that are ongoing or currently contemplated, our future business prospects may be adversely impacted. We depend on BSC for a significant amount of our future revenues and development of TAXUS. Although the acquisition of our Medical Products segment has diversified our revenue, we anticipate that a significant amount of our revenue for the next few years will be derived from and dependent upon royalty revenues from BSC. We do not have control over the sales and marketing efforts, stent pricing, production volumes, distribution or regulatory environment related to BSCs paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent program. Our involvement is limited to the terms of our 1997 License Agreement (as amended) with BSC and Cook, which provides for the receipt of royalty revenue based on the net sales of TAXUS and specifies the applicable royalty rates. Royalty revenue from BSC for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2008 decreased by 46% and 24% respectively from the same periods in 2007, which BSC has attributed to a decline in the number of angioplasty procedures in the United States and is expected to decline further during the year ending December 31, 2009. If BSC is impaired in its ability to market and distribute TAXUS, whether for this reason or due to a failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, discovery of a defect in the device, increased incidence of adverse events or identification of other safety issues, or previously-unknown problems with the manufacturing operations for TAXUS (any of which could, under certain circumstances, result in a manufacturing injunction), our revenues could be further significantly reduced. BSCs failure to resolve these issues in a timely manner and to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory authorities, or the occurrence of similar problem s in the future, could delay the launch of TAXUS Liberté in the United States and could have a significant impact on our royalty revenue from sales of TAXUS. Additionally, BSC may terminate our 1997 License Agreement under certain circumstances, including, if BSC is unable to acquire a supply of paclitaxel at a commercially reasonable price, if BSC reasonably determines that the paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent is no longer commercially viable, or if our license agreement with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), certain rights under which are sublicensed to BSC, terminates. During the year ended December 31, 2008, revenue from BSC represented approximately 30% of our total revenue from continuing operations, compared to 37% in 2007. The amounts payable by BSC to us vary from 1% to 9% of net sales depending on various factors, including volume of sales from time to time and patent protection laws in the country of sale. From these amounts, we must pay certain royalties to our licensors, including the NIH and the University of British Columbia (UBC), under license agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the average gross royalty rate earned was 7.1% for sales in the United States and 6.4% for sales in other countries. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the average gross royalty rate earned was 7.6% for sales in the United States and 5.6% for sales in other countries. There is no guarantee that royalty payments under our 1997 License Agreement will continue, and demand for BSCs paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent products could continue to decline as a result of the factors stated above, as well as competition, technological change, reimbursement or other factors. Also, the royalty rate payable by BSC could decline if and when patent protection expires, or no longer exists as defined by our 1997 License Agreement, in certain jurisdictions. - 15 - Boston Scientific may be enjoined from the selling, or otherwise become subject to limitations applicable to its ability to sell, TAXUS in the United States. Our royalty revenue derived from the sale of paclitaxel-eluting coronary stents depends on BSCs ability to continue to sell its TAXUS Express 2 stent and to launch next generation paclitaxel-eluting stents, including the TAXUS Liberté stent, in the United States. Historically, stent manufacture and sale is the subject of a substantial amount of U.S. patent litigation, and we anticipate that our licensees, including BSC and others, may be involved in material legal proceedings related to paclitaxel-eluting stents. Many of the products we are depending on to grow our business are not yet ready for sale or have only recently been introduced for sale. Many of the products we are depending on to drive future growth are not yet ready for sale or have only recently been introduced for sale. For example, our Option IVC filter has not yet been approved for sale in the U.S, our 5-FU CVC has been approved for sale but has not yet been commercially launched, and our Quill SRS and HemoStream Chronic Dialysis Catheter products have only recently become available for sale. If any of these or our other products are not approved for sale or do not achieve market acceptance, our ability to generate revenues will be adversely affected. If our products are alleged to be harmful, we may not be able to sell them, we may be subject to product liability claims not covered by insurance and our reputation could be damaged. The nature of our business exposes us to potential liability risks inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. Using our drug candidates or devices in clinical trials may expose us to product liability claims. These risks will expand with respect to drugs or devices, if any, that receive regulatory approval for commercial sale. In addition, some of the products we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time. Even if a drug or device were approved for commercial use by an appropriate governmental agency, there can be no assurance that users will not claim that effects other than those intended may have resulted from our products. Component failures, manufacturing flaws, quality system failures, design defects, inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information or other safety issues with respect to these or other products we manufacture or sell could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient. In addition, although many of our products are subject to review and approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, under the current state of law, any approval of our products by such agencies will not prohibit products liability lawsuits from being brought against us in the event that our products are alleged to be defective, even if such products have been used for their approved indications and appropriate labels have been included. In the event that anyone alleges that any of our products are harmful, we may experience reduced consumer demand for our products or our products may be recalled from the market. In addition, we may be forced to defend individual or class action lawsuits and, if unsuccessful, to pay a substantial amount in damages. A recall of some of our products could result in exposure to additional product liability claims, lost sales and significant expense to perform the recall. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, including not only actual damages, but also punitive damages. The magnitude of the potential loss relating to these types of lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, the cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant. We do not have insurance covering our costs and losses as a result of any recall of products or devices incorporating our technologies whether such recall is instituted by a device manufacturer or us as required by a regulatory agency. Insurance to cover costs and losses associated with product recalls is expensive. If we seek insurance covering product recalls in the future it may not be available on acceptable terms. Even if obtained, insurance may not fully protect us against potential liability or cover our losses. Some manufacturers that suffered such claims in the past have been forced to cease operations or declare bankruptcy. We do have insurance covering product liability. However, our insurance may not fully protect us from potential product liability claims. If a product liability claim or a series of claims is brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage, our business could suffer. Some manufacturers that suffered such claims in the past have been forced to cease operations or even to declare bankruptcy. Our success depends on the successful commercialization of our technology. The successful commercialization of our technology is crucial for our success. Successful product development in the pharmaceutical industry is highly uncertain and very few research and development projects produce a commercial product. Medical devices, pharmaceutical applications and surgical implants utilizing our technology are in various stages of clinical and commercial development and face a variety of risks and uncertainties. Principally, these risks and uncertainties include the following: o Future clinical trial results may show that some or all of our technology, or the technology of our strategic collaborators that incorporate our technology, is not safe or effective. - 16 - o Even if our technology is shown to be safe and effective, we and our strategic collaborators may face significant or unforeseen difficulties in manufacturing our medical devices or the medical devices and surgical implants that use our technology. These difficulties may become apparent when we or our strategic collaborators manufacture the medical devices or surgical implants on a small scale for clinical trials and regulatory approval or may only become apparent when scaling-up the manufacturing to commercial scale. o Even if our technology-based products are successfully developed, receive all necessary regulatory approvals and are commercially produced, there is no guarantee that there will be market acceptance of them or that they will not cause unanticipated side effects in patients. For example, if drug-eluting stents are found to cause, or are perceived to be the cause of, blood clots in patients, then sales of our drug-eluting stent products may be adversely affected. In addition, there is no guarantee that there will be market acceptance of our products. Our ability to achieve market acceptance for any of our products will depend on a number of factors, including whether or not competitors may develop technologies which are superior to or less costly than our technology-based products, and whether governmental and private third-party payers provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products, with the result that our technology-based products, e ven if they are successfully developed, manufactured and approved, may not generate significant revenues. If we are unsuccessful in dealing with any of these risks, or if we are unable to successfully commercialize our technology for some other reason, it would likely seriously harm our ability to generate revenue. We depend on our strategic collaborators for the development, regulatory approval, testing, manufacturing and the potential commercialization of our products. Historically, our strategy has been to enter into various arrangements with corporate and academic collaborators, licensors, licensees and others for the research, development, clinical testing, regulatory approval, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of our product candidates. For instance, we collaborate with BSC and Cook to develop and market paclitaxel-eluting coronary and peripheral stents, and with Baxter to manufacture and market our CoSealTM product for use as both a sealant and adhesion prevention product. Strategic collaborators, both existing (particularly BSC) and those that we may collaborate with in the future, are or may be essential to the development of our technology and potential revenue and we have little control over or access to information regarding our collaborators activities with respect to our products. Our strategic collaborators may fail to successfully develop or commercialize our technology to which they have rights for a number of reasons, including: o failure of a strategic collaborator to continue, or delays in, its funding, research, development and commercialization activities; o the pursuit or development by a strategic collaborator of alternative technologies, either on its own or with others, including our competitors, as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by our programs; o the preclusion of a strategic collaborator from developing or commercializing any product, through, for example, litigation or other legal action; and o the failure of a strategic collaborator to make required milestone payments, meet contractual milestone obligations or exercise options which may result in our terminating applicable licensing arrangements. We have and we expect that we will continue to enter into licensing agreements with third parties to give us access to technologies that we may use to develop products through our strategic collaboration and partnership arrangements. The technologies governed by these license agreements may be critical to our ability to maintain our competitive advantage in our existing products and to develop future products. For example, through licenses with NIH and UBC, we have been granted access to technologies that have contributed to the development of the TAXUS paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent. Pursuant to terms of existing license agreements, licensors have the ability to terminate their respective licenses upon the occurrence of certain specified circumstances. Events which may allow licensors to exercise these termination provisions include our bankruptcy, sub-licensing without the licensors consent, a transaction which results in a change of control of us, our failure to use the required level of diligence efforts to develop, market and sell products based on the licensed technology, our failure to maintain adequate levels of insurance with respect to the licensed technologies or other acts or omissions that may constitute a breach by us of our license agreement. In addition, any failure to continue to have access to these technologies may materially affect the benefits that we currently derive from the collaboration and partnership arrangements and may negatively impact our results and operations. If our process related to product development does not result in an approved and commercially successful product, our business could be adversely affected. We focus our research and development activities on areas in which we have particular strengths. The outcome of any development program is highly uncertain, notwithstanding how promising a particular program may seem. Success in pre-clinical and early-stage clinical trials may not necessarily translate into success in large scale clinical trials. Further, to be successful in clinical trials, increased investment will be necessary, which will adversely affect our short-term profitability. - 17 - In addition, we will need to obtain and maintain regulatory approval in order to market new products. Notwithstanding the outcome of clinical trials for new products, regulatory approval may not be achieved. The results of clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent approval or result in the need for post-marketing studies. In addition, changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and review by regulators of a new application may cause delays or rejection. Even if we receive regulatory approval, this approval may include limitations on the indications for which we can market the product. There is no guarantee that we will be able to satisfy the applicable regulatory requirements, and we may suffer a significant variation from planned revenue as a result. Our current and planned clinical trials may not begin on time, or at all, and may not be completed on schedule, or at all. The commencement or completion of any of our clinical trials may be delayed or halted for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: o the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold; o the data and safety monitoring committee of a clinical trial recommends that a trial be placed on hold or suspended; o patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate we expect; o patients are not followed-up at the rate we expect; o patients experience adverse side effects or events related to our products; o patients die or suffer adverse medical effects during a clinical trial for a variety of reasons, including the advanced stage of their disease and medical problems, which may or may not be related to our product candidates; o regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials if investigators find us not to be in compliance with regulatory requirements; o the failure of our manufacturing process to produce finished products which conform to design and performance specifications; o changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions; o the interim results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or negative; o pre-clinical or clinical data is interpreted by third parties in different ways; o our clinical trial expenditures are constrained by our budgetary considerations; or o our trial design, although approved, is inadequate to demonstrate safety and/or efficacy. Clinical trials may require the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Patient enrollment in clinical trials and completion of patient follow-up in clinical trials depend on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the study and patient compliance. For example, patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-treatment procedures to assess the safety and effectiveness of our products, or they may be persuaded to participate in contemporaneous trials of competitive products. Delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a study may cause an increase in costs and delays or may result in the failure of the trial. Our clinical trial costs will increase if we have material delays in our clinical trials or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned. Adverse events during a clinical trial could cause us to repeat a trial, terminate a trial or cancel an entire program. Pre-clinical development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and we may terminate one or more of our pre-clinical development programs. We may determine that certain pre-clinical product candidates or programs do not have sufficient potential to warrant the allocation of resources. Accordingly, we may elect to terminate our programs for such product candidates. If we terminate a pre-clinical program in which we have invested significant resources, our prospects will suffer, as we will have expended resources on a program that will not provide a return on our investment and we will have missed the opportunity to have allocated those resources to potentially more productive uses. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property or obtain necessary intellectual property rights from third parties, which could adversely affect our business. Our success depends, in part, on ensuring that our intellectual property rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or effectively maintained as trade secrets and our ability to detect violations of our intellectual property rights and enforce such rights against others. - 18 - The validity of our patent claims depends, in part, on whether prior art references described or rendered obvious our inventions as of the filing date of our patent applications. We may not have identified all prior art, such as U.S. and foreign patents, published applications or published scientific literature, that could adversely affect the validity of our issued patents or the patentability of our pending patent applications. For example, patent applications in the United States are maintained in confidence for up to 18 months after their filing. In some cases, however, patent applications remain confidential in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which we refer to as the U.S. Patent Office, for the entire time prior to issuance as a U.S. patent. Patent applications filed in countries outside the United States are not typically published until at least 18 months from their first filing date. Similarly, publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature oft en lags behind actual discoveries. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent, or the first to file patent applications related to, our technology. In the event that a third party has also filed a U.S. patent application covering a similar invention, we may have to participate in an adversarial proceeding, known as an interference, declared by the U.S. Patent Office to determine priority of invention in the United States. It is possible that we may be unsuccessful in the interference, resulting in a loss of some portion or all of our U.S. patent positions. The laws in some foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States, and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. If we encounter such difficulties or we are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, our business prospects could be s ubstantially harmed. We frequently seek patents to protect our intellectual property. It should be recognized that we may not be able to obtain patent protection for key elements of our technology, as the patent positions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal issues are largely unresolved. For example, no consistent policy has emerged regarding the scope of health-related patent claims that are granted by the U.S. Patent Office or enforced by the U.S. federal courts. Rights under any of our issued patents may not provide us with commercially meaningful protection for our products or afford us a commercial advantage against our competitors or their competitive products or processes. In addition, even if a patent is issued, the coverage claimed in a patent application may be significantly reduced in the patent as granted. There can be no assurance that: o patent applications will result in the issuance of patents; o additional proprietary products developed will be patentable; o licenses we have obtained from third parties that we use in connection with our technology will not be terminated; o patents issued will provide adequate protection or any competitive advantages; o patents will not be successfully challenged by any third parties; or o the patents of others will not impede our or our collaborators ability to commercialize our technology. For example, the drug paclitaxel is itself not covered by composition of matter patents. Therefore, although we are developing an intellectual property portfolio around the use of paclitaxel for intended commercial applications, others may be able to engage in off-label use of paclitaxel for the same indications, causing us to lose potential revenue. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar products or technologies or, if patents are issued to us, design around any patented technology developed by us, which could affect our potential to generate revenues and harm our results of operations. Patent protection for our technology may not be available based on prior art. The publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries. As a consequence, there may be uncertainty as to whether we or a third party were the first creator of inventions covered by issued patents or pending patent applications or that we or a third party were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. Moreover, we might have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent Office, or other proceedings outside the United States, including oppositions, to determine priority of invention or patentability, which could result in substantial cost to us even if the outcome were favorable. An unfavorable outcome in an interference or opposition proceeding could preclude us, our collaborators and our licensees from making, using or selling products using the technology or require us to obtain license rights from prevaili ng third parties. We do not know whether any prevailing party would offer us a license on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. We may also be forced to pay damages or royalties for our past use of such intellectual property rights, as well as royalties for any continued usage. As part of our patent strategy, we have filed a variety of patent applications internationally. Oppositions have been filed against various granted patents that we either own or license and which are related to certain of our technologies. See Legal Proceedings elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the proceedings related to certain of such oppositions. Our future success and competitive position depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain certain proprietary intellectual property rights used in our approved products and principal product candidates. Any such success depends in part on effectively prosecuting claims against others who we believe are infringing our rights and by effectively defending claims of intellectual property infringement brought by our competitors and others. The stent-related markets have experienced rapid technological change and obsolescence in the recent past, and our competitors have strong incentives to attempt to stop or delay us from introducing new products and technologies. See We may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights. - 19 - We do not know whether the patents that we have obtained or licensed, or may be able to obtain or license in the future, would be held valid or enforceable by a court or whether a competitors technology or product would be found to infringe such patents. Further, we have no assurance that third parties will not properly or improperly modify or terminate any license they have granted to us. We have obtained licenses from third parties with respect to their intellectual property that we use in connection with our technology. However, we may need to obtain additional licenses for the development of our current or future products. Licenses may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all. If available, these licenses may obligate us to exercise diligence in bringing our technology to market and may obligate us to make minimum guarantee or milestone payments. This diligence and these milestone payments may be costly and could adversely affect our business. We may also be obligated to make royalty payments on the sales, if any, of products resulting from licensed technology and may be responsible for the costs of filing and prosecuting patent applications. These costs could affect our results of operations and decrease our earnings. Certain of our key technologies include trade secrets and know-how that may not be protected by patents. There can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our trade secrets. To help protect our rights, we undertake to require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. We cannot assure you that all employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators have signed such agreements, or that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure. Furthermore, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Any disclosure of confidential data into the public domain or to third parties could allow our competitors to learn our trade secrets and use the information in competition against us. If certain single-source suppliers fail to deliver key product components in a timely manner, our manufacturing ability would be impaired and our product sales could suffer. We depend on certain single-source suppliers that supply components used in the manufacture of certain of our products, including our Quill SRS product. If we need alternative sources for key component parts for any reason, these component parts may not be immediately available to us. If alternative suppliers are not immediately available, we will have to identify and qualify alternative suppliers, and production of these components may be delayed. We may not be able to find an adequate alternative supplier in a reasonable time period or on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Shipments of affected products have been limited or delayed as a result of such problems in the past, and similar problems could occur in the future. Our inability to obtain our key source supplies for the manufacture of our products may require us to delay shipments of products, harm customer relationships or force us to curtail or cease operations. If physicians do not recommend and endorse our products or products that use our technology, or if our working relationships with physicians deteriorate, our products or products that use our technology may not be accepted in the marketplace, which could adversely affect our sales and royalty revenues. In order for us to sell our products or continue to receive royalty revenues from the sale of products that use our technologies, physicians must recommend and endorse them. We believe that recommendations and endorsements by physicians will be essential for market acceptance of our products, and we do not know whether we will obtain the necessary recommendations or endorsements from physicians. Acceptance of our products or of products that use our technology depends on educating the medical community as to the distinctive characteristics, perceived benefits, safety, clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these products compared to products of competitors, and on training physicians in the proper application of these products. If we are not successful in obtaining the recommendations or endorsements of physicians for our products or our collaborators are not successful in doing the same for their products that use our technology, our sales and royalty revenues may no t increase or may decline. In addition, if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians, many of our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of professionals who use and support our products. The research, development, marketing and sales of many of our new and improved products is dependent upon our maintaining working relationships with physicians. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding our products and the marketing of our products. Physicians assist us as researchers, marketing consultants, product consultants, inventors and as public speakers. If we are unable to maintain our strong relationships with these professionals and continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could adversely affect the acceptance of our products in the marketplace and our sales. - 20 - If we are unable to license new technologies to utilize in the development of products, or our existing license agreements are terminated, our ability to maintain our competitive advantage in our existing products and to develop future products may be adversely affected. We have entered into, and we expect that we will continue to enter into, licensing agreements with third parties to give us access to technologies that we may use to develop products through our strategic collaboration and partnership arrangements. The technologies governed by these license agreements may be critical to our ability to maintain our competitive advantage in our existing products and to develop future products. For example, through licenses with the NIH and UBC, we have been granted access to technologies that have contributed to the developments of the Taxus Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent. Pursuant to terms of our existing license agreements, licensors have the right under certain specified circumstances to terminate their respective licenses. Events that may allow licensors to exercise these termination provisions include: o our bankruptcy; o sub-licensing without the licensors consent; o a transaction which results in a change of control of us; o our failure to use the required level of diligence to develop, market and sell products based on the licensed technology; o our failure to maintain adequate levels of insurance with respect to the licensed technologies; or o other acts or omissions that may constitute a breach by us of our license agreement. In addition, any failure to continue to have access to these technologies may materially adversely affect the benefits that we currently derive from our collaboration and partnership arrangements and may adversely affect our results and operations. Compulsory licensing and/or generic competition may affect our business in certain countries. In a number of countries, governmental authorities and other groups have suggested that companies which manufacture medical products (i.e., pharmaceuticals and medical devices) should make products available at a low cost. In some cases, governmental authorities have held that where a pharmaceutical or medical device company does not do so, their patents might not be enforceable to prevent generic competition. Alternatively, some governmental authorities could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of our products, thereby reducing our sales or the sales of our licensee(s). In all of these situations, the results of our operations in these countries could be adversely affected. We may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights. In connection with maintaining the value of our various intellectual property and exclusivity rights, we regularly evaluate the activities of others worldwide. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, or licenses to patents, maintain trade secret protection and enforce our rights against others. Should it become necessary to protect those rights, we intend to pursue all cost-efficient strategies, including, when appropriate, negotiation or litigation in any relevant jurisdiction. For a summary of certain of our current legal proceedings, see Legal Proceedings elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We intend to pursue and to defend vigorously any and all actions of third parties related to our material patents and pioneering technology. Any failure to obtain and protect intellectual property could adversely affect our business and our ability to operate could be hindered by the proprietary rights of others. Our involvement in intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense, adversely affecting the development of product candidates or sales of the challenged product or intellectual property and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources and intellectual property litigation may be used against us as a means of gaining a competitive advantage. Competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could affect our ability to continue our operations. In the event of an adverse outcome as a defendant in any such liti gation, we may, among other things, be required to: o pay substantial damages or back royalties; o cease the development, manufacture, use or sale of product candidates or products that infringe upon the intellectual property of others; o expend significant resources to design around a patent or to develop or acquire non-infringing intellectual property; o discontinue processes incorporating infringing technology; or o obtain licenses to the infringed intellectual property. We cannot be assured that we will be successful in developing or acquiring non-infringing intellectual property or that necessary licenses will be available upon reasonable terms, if at all. Any such development, acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources and could adversely affect our business and financial results. If we cannot develop or acquire such intellectual property or obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in any introduction of products or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses could be prohibited. - 21 - If third parties file patent applications, or are issued patents claiming technology also claimed by us in pending applications, we may be required to participate in interference proceedings with the U.S. Patent Office, or other proceedings outside the United States, including oppositions, to determine priority of invention or patentability, which could result in substantial cost to us even if the eventual outcome were favorable. Our ability to operate could be hindered by the proprietary rights of others. A number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies as well as research and academic institutions have developed technologies, filed patent applications or received patents on various technologies that may be related to our business. Some of these technologies, applications or patents may conflict with or adversely affect our technologies or intellectual property rights, including those that we license from others. We are aware of other parties holding intellectual property rights that may represent prior art or other potentially conflicting intellectual property, including stents coated with agents intended to reduce restenosis. Any conflicts with the intellectual property of others could limit the scope of the patents, if any, that we may be able to obtain or result in the denial of our current or future patent applications altogether. If patents that cover our activities are issued to other persons or companies, we could be charged with infringement. In the event that other parties patents cover any portion of our activities, we may be forced to develop alternatives or negotiate a license for such technology. We do not know whether we would be successful in either developing alternative technologies or acquiring licenses upon reasonable terms, if at all. Obtaining any such licenses could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources and could harm our business and decrease our earnings. If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in the introduction of our products or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is prohibited. Technological advances and evolving industry standards could reduce our future product sales, which could cause our revenues to grow more slowly or decline. The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, changing customer needs, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. The emergence of new industry standards in related fields may adversely affect the demand for our products. This could happen, for example, if new standards and technologies emerged that were incompatible with customer deployments of our applications. In addition, any compounds, products or processes that we develop may become obsolete or uneconomical before we recover any of the expenses incurred in connection with their development. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change, new industry standards, changed customer requirements or competitive products on a timely and cost-effective basis. Additionally, even if we are able to develop new products and product enhancements, we cannot assu re you that they will achieve market acceptance. We may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers. Many of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no such claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key research personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize certain product candidates, which could severely harm our business. We may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations. Our research and development processes and manufacturing operations involve the use of hazardous materials. We are subject to federal, state, provincial, local and other laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate or sell our products, which govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident or the discovery of pre-existing contamination at one or more of our facilities, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. We may not be specifically insured with respect to this liability, and we do not know whether we will be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future, or whether our operations, business or assets will be harmed by current or future environmental laws or re gulations. - 22 - We face and will continue to face significant competition. Competition from pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, biotechnology companies and academic and research institutions is intense and is expected to increase. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater product development capabilities, experience conducting clinical trials and financial, scientific, manufacturing, sales and marketing resources and experience than our company. Some of these competitors include JNJ, Guidant Corporation, Genzyme Corporation, Baxter, Abbott Laboratories, BSC, Medtronic, Inc., Wyeth, Inc., Novartis AG, C.R. Bard, the Allegiance division of Cardinal Health, Inc., Bausch & Lomb, and Covidien Ltd., among others. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, such as pharmaceutical companies, which may offer non-surgical alternative therapies for disease states which are currently or intended to be treated using our products. Other companies may: o develop and obtain patent protection for products earlier than us; o design around patented technology developed by us; o obtain regulatory approvals for such products more rapidly; o have greater manufacturing capabilities and other resources; o have larger or more experienced sales forces; o develop more effective or less expensive products; or o have greater success in obtaining adequate third-party payer coverage and reimbursement for their competing products. While we intend to expand our technological capabilities in order to remain competitive, there is a risk that: o research and development by others will render our technology or product candidates obsolete or non-competitive; o treatments or cures developed by others will be superior to any therapy developed by us; and o any therapy developed by us will not be preferred to any existing or newly-developed technologies. The commercial potential of our products and product candidates will be significantly limited if we are not able to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement or market acceptance for them. Our ability to commercialize human therapeutic products and product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for such products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payers or supported by the market for these products. There can be no assurance that third-party payers coverage and reimbursement will be available or sufficient for the products we might develop. Third party payers are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services and instituting cost containment measures to control or significantly influence the purchase of medical products and services. These cost containment measures, if instituted in a manner affecting the coverage of or payment for our products, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate profitably. In some countries in the European Union and in the United States, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly-approved healthcare products, and we do not know whether adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement will be available for us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development, which could seriously harm our business. In the United States, while reimbursement amounts previously approved appear to have provided a reasonable rate of return, there can be no assurance that our products will continue to be reimbursed at current rates or that third-party payers will continue to consider our products cost-effective and provide coverage and reimbursement for our products, in whole or in part. We cannot be certain that our products will gain commercial acceptance among physicians, patients and third party payers, even if necessary international and United States marketing approvals are maintained. We believe that recommendations and endorsements by physicians will be essential for market acceptance of our products, and we do not know whether these recommendations or endorsements will be obtained. We also believe that surgeons will not use these products unless they determine, based on clinical data and other factors, that the clinical benefits to patients and cost savings achieved through use of these products outweigh their cost. Acceptance among physicians may also depend upon the ability to train surgeons and other potential users of our products and the willingness of such users to learn these relatively new techniques. Future legislation or regulatory changes to, or consolidation in, the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell our product profitably. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system, and some could involve changes that could significantly affect our business. Efforts by governmental and third-party payers to reduce health care costs or the announcement of legislative proposals or reforms to implement government controls could cause a reduction in sales or in the selling price of our products, which would seriously harm our business. Additionally, initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry, including hospitals. This in turn has resulted in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from certain market segments as consolidated groups such as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our hospital customers. We expect that market demand, government regulation, and third-party reimbursement policies will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors, which may reduce competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. - 23 - We must receive regulatory approval for each of our product candidates before they can be sold commercially in Canada, the United States or internationally, which can take significant time and be very costly. The development, manufacture and sale of medical devices and human therapeutic products in Canada, the United States and internationally is governed by a variety of statutes and regulations. These laws require, among other things: o regulatory approval of manufacturing facilities and practices; o adequate and well-controlled research and testing of products in pre-clinical and clinical trials; o review and approval of submissions containing manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical data in order to obtain marketing approval based on establishing the safety and efficacy of the product for each use sought, including adherence to cGMPs during production and storage; and o control of marketing activities, including advertising and labelling. The product candidates currently under development by us or our collaborators will require significant research, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, pre-market review and approval, and investment of significant funds prior to their commercialization. In many instances, we are dependent on our collaborators for regulatory approval and compliance, and have little or no control over these matters. The process of completing clinical testing and obtaining such approvals is likely to take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and we do not know whether any clinical studies by us or our collaborators will be successful, that regulatory approvals will be received, or that regulatory approvals will be obtained in a timely manner. Despite the time and resources expended by us, regulatory approval is never guaranteed. Even if regulatory approval is obtained, regulatory agencies may limit the approval to certain diseases, conditions or categories of patients who can use them. If any of our development programs are not successfully completed in a timely fashion, required regulatory approvals are not obtained in a timely fashion, or products for which approvals are obtained are not commercially successful, it could seriously harm our business. Our products and manufacturing facilities that have, or may receive, regulatory approval, are or will be subject to ongoing regulation. In addition, we have little or no control over the manufacturing facilities of our collaborators in which certain of our products are manufactured. Our products and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by the FDA and by similar regulatory agencies abroad. Ongoing regulation includes compliance with an array of manufacturing and design controls and testing, quality control, storage and documentation procedures. Regulatory agencies may also require expensive post-approval studies. Any adverse events associated with our products must also be reported to regulatory authorities. If deficiencies in our or our collaborators manufacturing and laboratory facilities are discovered, or we or our collaborators fail to comply with applicable post-market regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may close the facility or suspend manufacturing. With respect to products manufactured by third-party contractors, we are, and we expect to continue to be, dependent on our collaborators for continuing regulatory compliance and we may have little or no control over these matters. Our ability to control third-party compliance with FDA and other regulatory requirements will be limited to contractual remedies and rights of inspection. Our failure or the failure of third-party manufacturers to comply with regulatory requirements applicable to our products may result in legal or regulatory action by those regulatory authorities. There can be no assurance that our or our collaborators manufacturing processes will satisfy regulatory, cGMP or International Standards Organization (ISO) requirements. In addition, there may be uncertainty as to whether or not we or others who are involved in the manufacturing process will be able to make the transition to commercial production of some of our newly developed products. A failure to achieve regulatory approval for manufacturing facilities or a failure to make the transition to commercial production for our products will adversely affect our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to fully comply with federal and state fraud and abuse laws, we could face substantial penalties, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to various laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, physician self-referral laws, the federal False Claims Act, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the federal False Statements Statute, and state law equivalents to these federal laws, which may not be limited to government-reimbursed items and may not contain identical exceptions. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. Any action against us for violation of these laws could have a significant impact on our business. In addition, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We have a network of approximately 160 distributors. Any action against us for violation by us or our distributors of this act could have a significant impact on our business. - 24 - We may be unsuccessful in marketing, selling and distributing certain of our products. We distribute a number of our products worldwide. In order to achieve commercial success for our approved products, we have previously expanded our sales and marketing force in the United States, Europe and other parts of the world. If our distribution personnel or methods are not sufficient to ensure we have supply to meet demand for our products or if there is a quality control failure with our products, it could harm our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other marketing and sales arrangements with other companies, any revenues received will be dependent on the efforts of others, and we do not know whether these efforts will be successful. Failure to develop a direct sales and marketing force or enter into appropriate arrangements with other companies to market and sell our products will reduce our ability to generate revenues. We may encounter unanticipated costs or loss of business associated with terminating or relocating facilities and operations. We have consolidated our Syracuse, New York and Puerto Rico manufacturing facilities into two facilities in Puerto Rico. There is a risk that there may be further unanticipated costs associated with this consolidation. Consolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Many healthcare industry companies, including medical device companies, are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. These industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices that incorporate components produced by us. If we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the healthcare industry, our revenues would decrease and our consolidated earnings, financial condition or cash flows would suffer. We may incur losses associated with foreign currency fluctuations. We report our operating results and financial position in U.S. dollars in order to more accurately represent the currency of the economic environment in which we operate. Our operations are in some instances conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could cause us to incur currency exchange losses. In addition to the U.S. dollar, we currently conduct operations in Canadian dollars, Euros, Swiss francs, Danish kroner, and U.K. pounds sterling. Exchange rate fluctuations may reduce our future operating results and comprehensive income. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we reported $0.5 million of net foreign exchange gains due to foreign currency fluctuations compared to $0.3 million of foreign exchange losses for the year ended December 31, 2007. We have not entered into any forward currency contracts or other financial derivatives to hedge foreign exchange risk, and therefore we are subject to foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses. We purchase goods and services in U.S. and Canadian dollars, Swiss francs, Danish krone, Euros, and U.K. pounds sterling, and earn a significant portion of our license and milestone revenues in U.S. dollars. Foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by satisfying foreign denominated expenditures with cash flows or assets denominated in the same currency. Acquisition of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire additional assets and businesses principally relating to or complementary to our current operations. Any acquisitions or mergers by us will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies. These risks include, among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the companies and the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management. In addition, geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions. If significant acquisitions are made for cash consideration, we may be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Future acquisitions by us may cause large one-time expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant asset impairment charges in the future. Acquisition financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. - 25 - If we fail to hire and retain key management, scientific and technical personnel, we may be unable to successfully implement our business plan. We are highly dependent on our senior management and scientific and technical personnel. The competition for qualified personnel in the healthcare field is intense, and we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified managerial, scientific and technical personnel. Our ability to manage growth effectively will require continued implementation and improvement of our management systems and the ability to recruit and train new employees. We may not be able to successfully attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel, which could harm our ability to develop our product candidates and generate revenues. Risks Relating to our Indebtedness, Shares, and Organization and Structure Our existing and future permitted debt could adversely affect our operations and we may need to restructure our existing debt to ensure that our cash flows are adequate to service our debt. As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding $575 million of indebtedness, excluding accrued interest. Excluding intercompany transactions, our subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the Floating Rate Notes or Subordinated Notes accounted for approximately $85.1 million or 30% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 ($53.0 million or 18% respectively for the year ended December 31, 2007), and approximately $0.3 million of our total assets and $0.1 million of our total liabilities as of December 31, 2008 ($488 million and $116 million respectively for the year ended December 31, 2007). The Floating Rate Notes and the Subordinated Notes are guaranteed by the same group of our subsidiaries. The amount and terms of our indebtedness and other financial obligations have adversely affected our operations. For example, it: o increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; o limits our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes; o requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for operations and any future business opportunities, including acquisitions permitted by our Subordinated Notes and Floating Rate Notes; o limits our planning flexibility for, or ability to react to, changes in our business and the industry as discussed under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview Financial and Strategic Alternatives Process in this Annual Report on Form 10-K; and o places us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness and other obligations or greater access to financing. The Floating Rate Notes bear interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing benchmarks. If interest rates increase, we may be unable to meet our debt service obligations under the Floating Rate Notes and Subordinated Notes and other indebtedness. On March 2, 2009, we announced that we had completed a financing transaction with Wells Fargo Foothill, LLC, consisting of a delayed draw term loan facility of up to $10 million and a new secured revolving credit facility providing up to an additional $22.5 million in available credit. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources New Senior Secured Credit Facilities in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although this new credit facility provides enhanced liquidity in the near term, if our cash flows are worse than expected, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to repay or refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we would have to consider other options, such as: · sales of certain assets to meet our debt service obligations; · sales of equity; and · negotiations with our lenders and the holders of our Floating Rate Notes and our Subordinated Notes to restructure the applicable debt. We may not be able to implement one or more of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our financing arrangements and the indentures governing our Floating Rate Notes and Subordinated Notes may restrict, or market or business conditions may limit, our ability to do some of these things. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing when we need it or on terms satisfactory to us, our development activities could have to be delayed, curtailed or eliminated and our financial results could be adversely affected. - 26 - We and our subsidiaries are permitted to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our leverage. The terms of the indentures governing the Floating Rate Notes and Subordinated Notes expressly permit the incurrence of additional amounts of debt for specified purposes. For example, on March 2, 2009, we announced that we had entered into a new revolving credit facility, and all borrowings under that facility rank senior to the Subordinated Notes and the related guarantees, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such borrowings. Moreover, the indentures governing the Floating Rate Notes and Subordinated Notes do not impose any limitation on our incurrence of liabilities that are not defined as Indebtedness under such indentures (such as trade payables). If new debt or other liabilities are added to our and our subsidiaries current levels of debt, the related risks that we and they now face could be exacerbated. If our cash flows prove inadequate to service our debt and provide for our other obligations, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or future debt at terms unfavorable to us. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our debt, including the Floating Rate Notes, the Subordinated Notes and other financial obligations, and to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow. This will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Although we have recently entered into a new senior secured credit facility, if our cash flows are worse than expected, and the amounts we are able to draw on that facility prove inadequate to meet our debt service and other obligations in the future, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing or future debt, including the Floating Rate Notes and Subordinated Notes, on or before maturity, to sell assets or to obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, inclu ding the Floating Rate Notes and Subordinated Notes, sell any such assets or obtain such additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Additionally, because the indentures governing the Floating Rate Notes and Subordinated Notes require that, upon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the indentures, we must make an offer to repurchase the Floating Rate Notes and Subordinated Notes, respectively, at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. In the event that we were required to repurchase the Floating Rate Notes and Subordinated Notes pursuant to our offer, we would not have enough cash available to make such repurchase. For additional risks related to the refinancing of our existing debt, see Our existing and future permitted debt could adversely affect our operations, and we need to restructure our existing debt to ensure that our cash flows are adequate to service our debt. The indentures governing the Floating Rate Notes and Subordinated Notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to take advantage of certain business opportunities advantageous to us that may arise. The indentures governing the Floating Rate Notes and Subordinated Notes contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to: o incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; o pay dividends or make other equity distributions to our shareholders; o purchase or redeem our capital stock; o make certain investments; o create liens; o sell or otherwise dispose of assets; o engage in transactions with our affiliates; and o merge or consolidate with another entity or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business, industry or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. Although the indentures for the Floating Rate Notes and Subordinated Notes contain a fixed charge coverage test that limits our ability to incur indebtedness, this limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications. Moreover, the indentures do not impose any limitation on our incurrence of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the indentures (such as operating leases), nor do they impose any limitation on the amount of liabilities incurred by subsidiaries, if any, that might be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the indentures. Despite current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our leverage. Also, although the indentures limit our ability to make restricted payments, these restrictions are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. - 27 - The current global credit and financial market conditions may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business. Sales of our products are dependent, in large part, on reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, distribution partners and other organizations. As a result of the current global credit and financial market conditions, these organizations may be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations or may delay payment. In addition, federal and state health authorities may reduce Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, and private insurers may increase their scrutiny of claims. A reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement could negatively affect our product sales and revenue. Due to the recent tightening of global credit, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third-party contractors, suppliers or collaborators. We rely on third parties for several important aspects of our business, including royalty revenue, portions of our product manufacturing, clinical development of future collaboration products, conduct of clinical trials and raw materials. If such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us, our business would be adversely affected. Certain of our products are used in elective medical procedures which are not covered by insurance. Adverse changes in the economy or other conditions or events have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on consumer spending and may reduce the demand for these procedures. Any such changes, conditions or events could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations. The NASDAQ and/or the Toronto Stock Exchange may delist our common shares from quotation on its exchange, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our common shares and subject us to additional trading restrictions. The NASDAQ rules provide that the exchange can delist a companys shares for failing to maintain a share price above a dollar. Our common shares are currently trading at less than a dollar on the NASDAQ. The NASDAQ has currently placed a moratorium on delistings for failing to maintain a share price above a dollar. We cannot assure you that the price of our common shares will rise above a dollar or that our common shares will continue to be traded on the NASDAQ in the future. The Toronto Stock Exchange may delist a companys shares if, in the opinion of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the financial condition and/or the operating results of the company appear to be unsatisfactory or appear not to warrant continuation of the securities on the trading list. The Toronto Stock Exchange may consider a number of factors when determining whether to delist a companys shares, including the companys ability to meet its obligations as they become due, working capital position, quick asset position, total assets, capitalization, cash flow, earnings, annual revenues, public distribution of the listed shares, share price and trading activity. We cannot assure you that we will continue to meet the listing requirements of the Toronto Stock Exchange or that our common shares will continue to be traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange in the future. The threat of delisting and/or a delisting of our common shares could have material adverse effects by, among other things: · reducing the liquidity and market price of our common shares; · reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our commons shares, thereby further restricting our ability to obtain equity financing; · reducing the amount of news and analyst coverage of our company; and · reducing our ability to retain, attract and motivate our directors, officers and employees. United States investors may not be able to obtain enforcement of civil liabilities against us. We were formed under the laws of British Columbia, Canada. A substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States. In addition, a majority of the members of our board of directors and our officers are residents of countries other than the United States. As a result, it may be impossible for United States investors to affect service of process within the United States upon us or these persons or to enforce against us or these persons any judgments in civil and commercial matters, including judgments under United States federal or state securities laws. In addition, a Canadian court may not permit United States investors to bring an original action in Canada or to enforce in Canada a judgment of a state or federal court in the United States. Laws and provisions in our notice of articles, articles, shareholder rights plan and stock option plan could delay or deter a change in control. Our notice of articles and articles allow for the issuance of Class I preference shares. The board of directors may set the rights and restrictions of any series of preference shares in its sole discretion without the approval of the holders of our common shares. The rights and restrictions of our preference shares may be superior to those of the common shares. Accordingly, the issuance of preference shares also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company. There are at present, no preference shares outstanding. In addition, under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) and our articles, some business combinations, including the sale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of our undertaking, must be approved by at least three-quarters of the votes cast by our shareholders in aggregate or, in some cases, approved by at least three-quarters of the votes cast by holders of each class of shares. In some cases, a business combination must be approved by a court. Shareholders may also have a right to dissent from the transaction, in which case, we would be required to pay dissenting shareholders the fair value of their common shares provided they have followed the required procedures. - 28 - In addition, our shareholders adopted a shareholder rights plan which provides for substantial dilution to an acquiror of 20% or more of our common shares, except in certain circumstances, including a) the acquiror makes a bid to all shareholders, which, among other things, is held open for at least 60 days and is accepted by independent shareholders holding at least 50% of the outstanding common shares, or b) the bid is otherwise approved by our board of directors. The shareholder rights plan was amended and restated on October 30, 2008 and must be reconfirmed by the shareholders every three years. Furthermore, all of our executive officers have contractual rights under employment agreements that provide for 12 to 24 months severance pay in the event of a change of control of our company. Under our stock option plan, following a change of control, all outstanding stock options vest immediately. In the event that an offer is made to our shareholders generally or to a class of our shareholders, that if accepted would result in the offeror becoming a control person (generally meaning a person holding 20% or more of a companys voting shares), our board of directors has the discretion under our stock option plan to determine to accelerate the vesting and expiry date of all outstanding options. Limitations on the ability to acquire and hold our common shares may be imposed by the Competition Act (Canada). This legislation permits the Commissioner of Competition to review any acquisition of a significant interest in our company. This legislation grants the Commissioner jurisdiction to challenge such an acquisition before the Competition Tribunal if the Commissioner believes that it would, or would be likely to, result in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition in any market in Canada. The Investment Canada Act (Canada) subjects an acquisition of control of a company by a non-Canadian to government review if the value of our assets as calculated pursuant to the legislation exceeds a threshold amount which, for an investor from a World Trade Organization member country, is CDN$312 million in 2009. A reviewable acquisition may not proceed unless the relevant minister is satisfied or is deemed to be satisfied that there is likely to be a net benefit to Ca nada from the transaction. Each of these matters could delay or deter a change in control that would be attractive to, and provide liquidity for, shareholders, and could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for our common shares.
