Risk Factors We may selectively pursue strategic opportunities like acquisitions or joint ventures, but we may not be able to successfully do so or realize the intended benefits of such transactions. We continually evaluate potential acquisitions and joint ventures. There can be no assurance that suitable acquisition candidates may be identified and acquired in the future, that the financing or necessary consents for any such acquisitions will be available on satisfactory terms or that we will be able to accomplish our strategic objectives in making any such acquisition. We will encounter various risks if we acquire other companies, including the possible inability to integrate successfully an acquired business into our operations and unanticipated problems or liabilities, whether or not known at the time of acquisition. We could incur additional indebtedness in connection with our acquisition strategy and increase our leverage. As described above under Recent Development (page 3), we have recently acquired certain assets of Tomco . We may encounter various risks as a result of this acquisition, including the possible inability to integrate successfully this business into our operations and unanticipated problems or liabilities. Our pension plans are currently under-funded and we may have to make cash payments to the plans, reducing the cash availability. We sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering certain active and retired union employees in the United States that are under-funded and require future cash payments. Additionally, if the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet our expectations, or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our required contributions may be higher than we expect. If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our pension liability, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional capital, or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. During 2006, we made contributions, including employee contributions and benefit payments made directly by the Company of $377,000 to the defined benefit plans. The under funded status at December 31, 2006 was $2,346,000. Our pension expense was $95,000 for 2006 and $245,000 for 2005. For 2007, we expect the pension expense to be $18,000. We are dependent on certain key customers, and the loss of one or more customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. A substantial portion of our business results from sales to key customers. In 2006, our four largest customers in aggregate accounted for 73% of net sales. If one or several of these key customers were to reduce their orders substantially or terminate purchases, we would suffer a decline in revenue and profits, and those declines could be material and adverse. We are highly dependent on certain key personnel. We are highly dependent on the services of Jerry A. Bragiel, our Chief Executive Officer. Were we to lose the services of Mr. Bragiel, we could face a significant risk of declining revenue and/or operating income. The success of our business also requires that we retain other qualified management personnel. Our success is also dependent upon our ability to hire and retain qualified management, marketing, technical, financial and other personnel, including our chief financial officer. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel. Any inability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on us. Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. Our credit facility and other debt agreements contain a number of significant covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to: · incur additional indebtedness or issue redeemable preferred stock · pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock · make certain investments · transfer or sell assets · incur liens · engage in mergers · make capital expenditures In addition, under the credit facility, we are required to satisfy specified financial tests. Our ability to comply with those provisions may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet those tests. Increasing costs for or reduced availability of components and raw materials may adversely affect our profitability. The principal raw materials we purchase include cores, components and other raw materials. Raw materials comprise a large component of our costs, representing approximately 33% of our total costs during the year ended December 31, 2006. A significant increase in the price of these items could materially increase our operating costs and materially and adversely affect our profit margins. For example, we have experienced significant price increases in raw material as a result of petroleum prices and limited competition for specialized components. We could be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive automotive parts industry. The automotive parts industry is highly competitive. We face numerous competitors in each of the product lines we serve. In general, there are three or more significant competitors for most of the products offered by our company and numerous smaller competitors. We also face increased competition for certain of our products from suppliers producing in lower-cost countries such as Mexico. We may not be able to continue to compete favorably and increased competition in our markets may have a material adverse effect on our business. We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty and recall claims that may be brought against us. We may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. Accordingly, we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims. In addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or the alleged defect relates to automotive safety. Our costs associated with providing product warranties could be material. Product liability, warranty, and recall costs would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We are subject to a broad range of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, and local environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those governing emissions to air, discharges to water, noise and odor emissions; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste materials; the cleanup of contaminated properties; and human health and safety. We may incur substantial costs associated with hazardous substance contamination or exposure, including cleanup costs, fines, and civil or criminal sanctions, third party property or natural resource damage, or personal injury claims, or costs to upgrade or replace existing equipment, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or non-compliance with environmental permits required at our locations. In addition, many of our current and former facilities are located on properties with long histories of indust rial or Commercial operations and some of these properties have been subject to certain environmental investigations and remediation activities. Because some environmental laws (such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act) can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup upon any of the current or former owners or operators, retroactively and regardless of fault, we could become liable for investigating or remediate contamination at these or other properties (including offsite locations). We may not always be in complete compliance with all applicable requirements of environmental law or regulation, and we may incur material costs or liabilities in connection with such requirements. In addition, new environmental requirements or changes to existing requirements, or in their enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial con dition. We have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. While our costs to defend and settle claims arising under environmental laws in the past have not been material, such costs may be material in the future. For more information about our environmental compliance and potential environmental liabilities, see Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters. We are dependent on a mature product line whose volume continues to shrink. Approximately 55% of our net sales for 2006 involve the sale of remanufactured carburetors. The increase in the percentage of net sales involving the remanufactured carburetors was due to the Tomco acquisition and would have otherwise declined. We expect sales to decline in the future. Sales have and most likely will continue to decline for two reasons. First, the availability of acceptable carburetor cores continues to shrink due to age or damage to used carburetors. Secondly, the number of vehicles using carburetors continues to decline since the last domestic carbureted production vehicle was manufactured in 1988. Management is pursuing other new products and new markets for existing products; however, there is no assurance that new product lines or new markets will offset the continual carburetor sales erosion. Directors and officers indemnification. Our by-laws require us to indemnify any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to the full extent permitted by Illinois law. This may reduce the likelihood of shareholders instituting derivative litigation against directors and officers and may discourage or deter shareholders from suing our directors, officers, employees and agents for breaches of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders . The price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, volatile. The market price of our common shares has fluctuated, and it is likely that the price of our common shares will fluctuate in the future. Since January 1, 2006, the sale price for our common shares, as reported by OTC Market Report published by the National Quotations Bureau, has fluctuated from a low of $0.61 to a high of $1.01 per share. The market price of our common shares could be impacted by a variety of factors, including: · the shares are traded on the NASD Bulletin Board under the symbol “CREB” and are not listed on a stock exchange; · because of the low price of the shares, they may not be purchased by most institutional investors, and the volume of shares traded is generally low; · Only 1,472,228 shares are held by non-affiliates and available for public trading. In addition, the stock market continues to experience price and volume fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. We have the discretion to issue additional shares of preferred shares with rights and preferences superior to those granted to holders of our common shares. Our Articles of Incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred shares, from time to time, in one or more series. Our board of directors is authorized, without further approval of our shareholders, to fix the dividend rights and terms, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms, liquidation preferences, and any other rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions applicable to each new series of preferred shares. The issuance of such shares could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common shares and, under certain circumstances, make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common shares.
