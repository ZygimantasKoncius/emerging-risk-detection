Risk Factors Our results are subject to fluctuations in both the fixed income and equity markets Investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability, and fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Fluctuations in interest rates affect returns on and the market values of our fixed income investments. Generally, investment income will be reduced during sustained periods of lower interest rates as higher yielding fixed income securities are called, mature or are sold and the proceeds reinvested at lower rates. During periods of rising interest rates, prices of fixed income securities tend to fall and realized gains upon their sale are reduced. As at December 31, 2005, the fixed income investment assets backing our general insurance liabilities and shareholders funds were £11.6 billion. If interest rates were to rise by 100 basis points, the fair value of the fixed income portfolio would fall by approximately £300 million. We invest a portion of our assets in equities, which are generally subject to greater risks and more volatility than fixed income securities. General economic conditions, stock market conditions and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the equity markets. As at December 31, 2005, the equity investment assets backing our general insurance liabilities and shareholders funds were £1.7 billion. If world equity markets decreased by 15 per cent, the fair value of the equity portfolio would fall by approximately £250 million. Our investment returns are susceptible to changes in general economic conditions, including changes that impact the general creditworthiness of the issuers of debt securities and equity securities held in our portfolios. The value of our fixed income securities may be affected by changes in the investees credit rating. Where the credit rating of the issuer of a debt security drops, the value of the security may also decline. Should the credit rating of the issuer fall, a resulting disposal of the securities may lead to a significant loss on our investment. Fluctuations in interest rates and returns from equity markets also impact consumer behavior. More specifically, the demand for general insurance, particularly commercial lines, can vary with the overall level of economic activity. 7 Back to Contents In addition, the funding requirements of the Groups defined benefit plans and our contributions to those plans will be dependent upon, among other things, fluctuations in interest rates and in the equity markets. As at December 31, 2005, our defined benefit pension funds had an estimated deficit of £370 million (net of tax) (of which £131 million related to pension funds in the United States), a decrease from £544 million (net of tax) at year end 2004. At March 31, 2006 our defined benefit pension funds had an estimated deficit of £127 million (net of tax) (of which £114 million related to pension funds in the United States). This valuation uses assumptions in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 19, Employee Benefits (IAS 19). IAS 19 compares, at a given date, the current market value of a pension funds assets with its long term liabilities, using a discount rate in line with yields on AA rated bonds of suitable duration and currency. As such, the financial position of a pension fund on this basis will be highly sensitive to changes in bond rates and equity markets. In the United Kingdom we have an agreed deficit funding program which viewed today we believe will enable us to meet our obligations over the duration of the U.K. pension fund. We also a have funding program in place for the U.S. pension deficit. If these programs prove to be inadequate, because of the performance of the equity or fixed income portions of the pension funds portfolios or other factors, it is possible that we may be required to make further contributions or take other appropriate actions. We have exposures to financial enhancement products, which provide surety to banks, lending institutions and credit facilities that insure principal and interest repayment on debt securities. We no longer write such business. Within the financial enhancement portfolio of Financial Structures Limited, a U.S. subsidiary, are a variety of credit default products, including collateralized debt obligations (CDO) and credit enhancement and residual value insurance contracts. As of December 31, 2005, the gross and net CDO exposure aggregated approximately $241 million. In February 2006, one of the remaining two contracts was terminated for a net pre tax gain of $4 million. The fair value of the remaining contract at March 31, 2006, was a liability of $71 million. Our loss reserves may not adequately cover actual losses Our loss reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses experience. We maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses for reported and unreported losses incurred as of the end of each accounting period. Loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are estimates of the expected cost of the ultimate settlement of losses less losses paid to-date. These estimates are based on actuarial and statistical projections. In making the projections we consider facts and circumstances about our reported claims, trends in claim frequency and loss severity, emerging bases of liability, general economic conditions and other factors. Changes in these trends or other factors could result in claims in excess of loss reserves. For example, our assumptions concerning future loss cost inflation could prove to be insufficient at a time of rising interest rates, resulting in higher losses combined with a reduction in asset values in our investment portfolio to meet these losses. For some types of losses, most significantly asbestos-related and environmental pollution, it has been necessary, and may over time continue to be necessary, to revise estimated potential loss exposure and, therefore, the related loss reserves. Consequently, actual losses, and related expenses paid may differ from estimates reflected in the loss reserves in our financial statements. To the extent loss reserves are insufficient to cover actual losses, loss adjustment expenses or losses arising from changes in the legal environment we would have to add to these loss reserves. This could have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have significant exposure arising from insurance contracts underwritten in previous years. Contracts covering liability issues, for example, create risks in the fact that their loss projections are subject to actuarial calculations based on accepted methodologies used within the insurance industry worldwide which may not prove accurate. In particular, we have exposure to asbestos and environmental claims in the United States and the United Kingdom, other employer liability claims in the United Kingdom, personal accident claims in Scandinavia and workers compensation claims in the United States. We maintain significant reserves for these exposures and all are subject to specific actuarial calculations. These actuarial models and calculations are tested by external independent consultants but there are nonetheless residual risks in that the assumptions within the models which may not reflect future experience. Reserving for asbestos and environmental claims is subject to a range of uncertainties that are generally greater than those presented by other types of claims. These include long reporting delays, unresolved legal issues on policy coverage, and the identity of the insureds. As a consequence, traditional loss reserving techniques cannot wholly be relied on and we have employed specialized techniques to determine reserves in a prudent manner using the extensive knowledge of both internal asbestos and environmental experts and external legal and professional advisors. In addition, the prevalence of asbestos-related 8 Back to Contents claims is a more recent development in the United Kingdom than in the United States. As such, there is less data and information relating to asbestos claims in the United Kingdom available to conduct our U.K. asbestos reserving analysis and thus more potential for variability in ultimate outcomes. We use a discount factor of 5% to discount certain long tail reserves. While we believe 5% is a reasonable long term discount factor to use, the fact that current long term interest rates in our main markets may be below that level, and the fact that we may not have fully matched our assets to long term liabilities, creates a risk that our loss reserves for these long tail claims may not be sufficient. See Item 4Information on the CompanyProperty and Casualty Reserves for a fuller discussion of our property and casualty loss reserves including a discussion of the uncertainties around asbestos loss reserves. Our restructuring plans in the United States are subject to particular risks Our restructuring plans in the United States are complex and are subject to particular risks. Although we have reduced the number of lead regulatory states, our U.S. subsidiaries are subject to government regulation in their states of domicile and also in each of the jurisdictions in which they are licensed or authorized to do business. In the United States, the conduct of insurance business is regulated at the state level and not by the federal government and our subsidiaries are subject to state supervision of their regulatory capital and surplus positions. As of December 31, 2005, our consolidated U.S. regulatory capital and surplus capital position was 2.2 times the National Association of Insurance Commission risk-based capital, or RBC amount. Our objective is to reduce or eliminate the Groups exposures in relation to our U.S. business and we continue to review all options. Some events or transactions contemplated by our restructuring plans may give rise to risks and liabilities which, individually or taken together, are sufficiently material to create the need for the provision of additional capital or put at risk existing capital allocated to the U.S. We estimate the cost of implementing our restructuring program in the United States to total £300 million. We believe this is a prudent estimate of costs but the final level of expenses will depend on the precise actions taken to restructure the business, and potential developments that are not within our control including regulatory, employee and customer responses. At the end of 2005 the majority of this £300 million had been incurred. Insurance regulatory agencies in the United States have broad administrative power to regulate many aspects of a companys insurance business, including trade and claims practices, accounting methods and capital adequacy. These agencies are concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders rather than shareholders or creditors. Moreover, insurance laws and regulations, among other things, establish solvency requirements, including minimum reserves and capital and surplus requirements, limit the amount of dividends, intercompany loans and other payments our U.S. subsidiaries can make without prior regulatory approval, impose restrictions on the amounts and types of investments held, and require assessments to pay claims of insolvent insurance companies. Insurance regulatory agencies in the United States also have broad power to institute proceedings to take possession of the property of an insurer and to conduct the business of such insurer under rehabilitation and liquidation statutes. Among the reasons for instituting such proceedings may be that the insurer is found, upon examination, to be in such condition that further transaction of business will be hazardous to its policyholders, creditors or the public. The regulators in our domiciliary states continuously examine existing laws and regulations. We cannot predict the effect any proposed or future legislation or rulemaking in the United States or elsewhere may have on the financial condition or operations of our U.S. subsidiaries. In addition to the regulatory risks described above, our restructuring plans in the United States are subject to operational risks. For example, our plans are dependent in part upon significant management attention, which could adversely affect our ability to carry out the day-to- day functions of the business. In addition, we may not have or be able to retain personnel with the appropriate skill sets for the tasks associated with our restructuring, which could adversely affect the implementation of our plans. Litigation outcomes could adversely affect our business We are involved in, and may become involved in, legal proceedings that may be costly if we lose and that may divert managements attention. In common with the industry generally, the Group in the United States receives notifications and approaches from, and on behalf of, insureds who previously had peripheral or 9 Back to Contents secondary involvement in asbestos litigation indicating that they may be seeking coverage under Group policies. One such approach received during 2004 from General Motors Corporation is now subject to ongoing litigation. In addition we are involved in litigation in the United States in connection with a series of credit risk insurance policies covering loans made to students in various post-secondary trade schools in the United States, primarily truck driving schools. The original loan portfolio had a face value to approximately $501 million. In 2002, a U.S. subsidiary of the Group filed lawsuits seeking, among other things, rescission of these policies. The foregoing rescission actions gave rise to other related lawsuit filed in Delaware seeking to enforce the credit risk insurance policies. In April 2005 and October 2005 respectively, PNC Bank and Wilmington Trust, two of the plaintiffs in the Delaware actions, agreed to discontinue their part of the legal action following agreed settlements. The other plaintiffs were granted summary judgment which calculated through to March 31, 2006, was approximately $388 million. The summary judgment was overturned on appeal and the case returned to the District Court to determine coverage and whether the policies cover all of the losses claimed. The case is now proceeding through the District Court. Any losses on the student loan portfolio, to the extent not offset by reinsurance, recoveries from the original borrowers under the defaulted loans, any remaining reserves established under the loan programs or recoveries from other third parties, will ultimately be borne by the Groups U.S. subsidiary. In the ordinary course of our insurance activities, we are routinely involved in legal or arbitration proceedings with respect to liabilities which are the subject of policy claims. For example, we have estimated the cost of insurance losses associated with the terrorist actions of September 11, 2001 to be £280 million as at December 31, 2005, net of reinsurance. The final cost may be different from the current estimate due to the uncertainty associated with the ongoing appeals and the valuation and allocation process which is currently underway in respect of the Twin Towers complex. Appraisal hearings are scheduled to continue until December 2006. As a consequence, there is uncertainty as to the eventual cost of the insurance losses associated with this event. As insurance industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues can have a negative effect on our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number and size of claims. In addition, to the extent that legal decisions in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate world-wide increase court awards, the impact of which may be applied prospectively or retrospectively, claims and benefits reserves may prove insufficient to cover actual losses, loss adjustment expenses or future policy benefits. In such event, or where we have previously estimated that no liability would apply, we would have to add to our loss reserves and incur a charge to our earnings. Such insufficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The U.K. insurance market is currently subject to changes arising from the compensation framework relating to non-pecuniary loss, including pain and suffering, and loss of amenity. At present, although a number of decisions have been rendered, their full impact has yet to be reflected in court awards. In addition, a number of matters have not yet been ruled on. These changes to the compensation framework could have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For a further discussion on litigation risks, see Item 8Financial InformationLegal Proceedings. We are subject to regulatory inquiries in the normal course of our business The Group, in common with the insurance industry, is subject to regulatory inquiries in the normal course of its business in many of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In recent years we have seen an increase in the number of inquiries being initiated by regulators, particularly in the United Kingdom, European Union and the United States, which may give rise to threatened litigation or disputes. There can be no assurance that any losses resulting from future regulatory inquiries may not have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 10 Back to Contents Regulatory changes could adversely affect our business and may have significant implications for our capital position Our insurance subsidiaries worldwide are subject to government regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. Regulatory agencies have broad administrative power over many aspects of the insurance business, which may include premium rates, marketing and selling practices, advertising, licensing agents, policy forms, capital adequacy and permitted investments. Government regulators are concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders rather than our shareholders or creditors. Insurance laws, regulations and policies currently affecting us and our subsidiaries may change at any time in ways having an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, we cannot predict the timing or form of future regulatory initiatives. The U.K. regulatory environment has been over the past few years, and continues to be, the subject of significant change in particular including solvency requirements. This is in part attributable to the implementation of European Union (EU) directives but is also the response of the regulators to the challenging market conditions that have prevailed. Until the requirements are finalized, there will be uncertainty as to the implications for the Groups solvency. In particular, the following developments, which are described elsewhere in this annual report, are relevant: • The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has established a new requirement from December 31, 2005 for U.K. insurers, where it is the lead European Economic Area (EEA) regulator, to publicly disclose the group capital calculation of its ultimate EEA insurance parent undertaking. At December 31, 2005, the Group had a surplus over the EU Insurance Groups Directive (IGD) requirement of £1.0 billion, an increase of £0.4 billion in the year. • The Integrated Prudential Sourcebook for Insurers (PRU), which came into force on December 31, 2004, requires a general insurance company to calculate an Enhanced Capital Requirement (ECR) although for the time being this will remain a target level of capital as opposed to a regulatory minimum. The ECR is based on the principle of there being a capital charge for the various types of risk that an insurer faces, such as underwriting, adverse claims development and credit risk. The ECR sets out capital charge percentages for particular lines of insurance business and for particular assets and liabilities. • PRU also introduced an additional requirement for companies to make their own Individual Capital Assessment (ICA) that is more specifically related to the risk profile of the particular company. The new FSA rules require a U.K. insurer to assess its own capital requirement based upon its circumstances and risk appetite and this is to be reviewed by the FSA. If the FSA considers the firms capital assessment to be insufficient they are empowered to issue Internal Capital Guidance (ICG), which could require the firm to maintain a capital buffer. The Group has adopted a dynamic financial analysis model in developing its ICA, which incorporates the generation of statistical distributions for our insurance, market and credit risk. This modeling has been supplemented by a number of other techniques in order to assess operational risk and to incorporate stress and scenario tests to fully assess its capital requirement. The results provide the Group with an indication of how much capital is needed. The Group has agreed its ICA with the FSA. On this new regulatory basis the Group has adequate capital but at the request of the FSA, and in common with the rest of industry, the final agreed capital requirement remains confidential. The Group monitors the ICA on a regular basis and continues to embed the application of the capital model into the Groups business processes. • Solvency II, the European Commissions project to reform the prudential regulation of European life and non-life insurance companies is now well underway with a draft Framework Directive scheduled for release in mid to late 2006. The final Directive is scheduled to be adopted by the European Commission in July 2007 for implementation in 2010. Solvency II will replace the current Solvency I regime which does not reflect the developments in financial markets and risk management techniques that have taken place over the past twenty years. Current solvency requirements differ across Europe and tend to be based on arbitrary formulaic calculations with little assessment of the variety of risks which an insurance company may face. Although these current measures provide a degree of policyholder protection, they create opportunities for 11 Back to Contents regulatory arbitrage between jurisdictions and lead to a disconnect between an insurers economic capital needs and regulatory capital requirements. Solvency II seeks to address these issues by creating a more risk sensitive approach to measuring an insurance companys capital requirements. The Group maintains a close dialogue with the FSA to gain as good an understanding as possible of the likely developments and, wherever possible, maximize the time available to plan for them. For a further discussion of these U.K. regulatory changes, see Item 4Information on the CompanyRegulation. Proposed U.S. legislation regarding U.S. asbestos liability could adversely affect our business Following recent debate in the Senate, the prospects of some form of asbestos reform, including a no fault Trust Fund, have substantially diminished during the first quarter 2006. However, the risk remains of reform progressing in a way that does not ensure finality and allows claims for individuals who have failed to establish genuine medical criteria. Our proposed program of strategic and operational improvements in the Core Group is large and challenging to implement Our program of strategic and operational improvements is complex. It involves a restructuring of, and the implementation of substantial changes to, a significant portion of the Groups operations. Successful implementation of this program will require a significant amount of management time and, thus, may affect or impair managements ability to run the business effectively during the period of implementation. In addition, we may not have, or be able to retain, personnel with the appropriate skill sets for the tasks associated with our improvement program, which could adversely affect the implementation of our plans. The estimated expense savings and the claims and underwriting improvements contemplated by the program are significant. Achieving our operational improvement goals will also require improvement in the pricing of our products, which is dependent in part on factors beyond our control, including general market conditions and in a number of jurisdictions regulatory controls on pricing. The Group currently anticipates that the total costs associated with the implementation of the expense savings program will amount to approximately £300 million of which the majority had been incurred by the end of the 2005. There can be no assurance that the costs will not exceed this amount. In addition certain of our intended operational improvements and expense savings are anticipated to arise from the selective use of outsourcing and the piloting of some outsourcing initiatives offshore. These initiatives and our existing outsourced operations may entail additional operational or control risks arising from the performance by third party contractors or consultants of functions or processes which were formerly carried out within the Group. These risks may result in additional requirements for supervision, audit or intervention by employees of the Group and potential costs in the event of the failure of systems or controls or a breach by a contractor or consultant of its obligations. There can be no assurance that the Group will realize the benefits planned in the time scheduled, or to the level expected. In the event that we are unable to successfully implement our strategy, our financial performance and results of operations could be adversely affected. Changes in our ratings may adversely affect us Financial strength ratings are an important factor in our competitive positioning. Rating organizations periodically review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries. Any lowering of our ratings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products and retain our current policyholders. These consequences could, depending upon the extent thereof, have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and, under certain circumstances, net income. Rating organizations assign ratings based upon several factors. While most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated companys control. 12 Back to Contents Standard & Poors Rating Services rate the Groups financial strength as A- stable outlook. This rating represents their third highest category of nine. Moodys Investors Services rate the Groups financial strength as Baa1 positive. This rating represents their fourth highest category of nine. A.M Best Company rate the Groups financial strength as A- stable. This represents their second highest category out of ten. Our results may be impacted by the inability or unwillingness of our reinsurers to meet their obligations We transfer our exposure to certain risks to others through reinsurance arrangements. Under such arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of the losses and expenses associated with reported and unreported losses in exchange for a premium. The availability, amount and cost of reinsurance depend on general market conditions and may vary significantly. Any decrease in the amount of our reinsurance will increase our risk of loss. When we obtain reinsurance, we still remain primarily liable for the reinsured risks without regard to whether the reinsurer will meet its reinsurance obligations to us. Therefore, the inability or unwillingness of our reinsurers to meet their financial obligations or disputes on, and defects in reinsurance contract wordings or processes could materially affect our operations. Although we conduct periodic reviews of the financial statements and reputations of our reinsurers, our reinsurers may become financially unsound by the time they are called upon to pay amounts due, which may not occur for many years. In addition, reinsurance may prove inadequate to protect against losses or may become unavailable in the future at commercially reasonable rates. We also participate in a number of fronting arrangements where the majority of business written under the arrangement is ceded to third parties who assume most of the risks, resulting in additional credit risk that the third parties will not meet their financial obligations on the business written. Catastrophes and weather-related events may adversely affect us General insurance companies frequently experience losses from catastrophes. Catastrophes may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Catastrophes include windstorms, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, severe hail, severe winter weather, floods, fires, terrorist attacks and epidemics. In addition, prolonged periods of dry weather can give rise to subsidence resulting in substantial volumes of claims, particularly under U.K. household buildings policies. The incidence and severity of these catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of our losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of losses our clients incur, the number of our clients affected, the frequency of the events and the severity of the particular catastrophe. Most catastrophes occur in small geographic areas. However, windstorms, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes may produce significant damage in large, heavily populated areas, and subsidence claims can arise in a number of geographic areas as a result of exceptional weather conditions. Our efforts to protect ourselves against catastrophe losses, such as the use of selective underwriting practices, the purchasing of reinsurance and the monitoring of risk accumulations, may not be adequate. The cyclical nature of the general insurance industry may cause fluctuations in our results Historically, the general insurance industry has been cyclical and operating results of insurers have fluctuated significantly because of volatile and sometimes unpredictable developments, many of which are beyond the direct control of any insurer. Although we have a geographically diverse group of businesses, we expect to experience the effects of this cyclical nature, including changes in premium levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The unpredictability and competitive nature of the general insurance business historically has contributed to significant quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year fluctuations in underwriting results and net earnings in the general insurance industry. In addition, unanticipated underwriting losses and claims reserve adjustments suffered by our insurance subsidiaries could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. 13 Back to Contents We face significant competition from other global, national and local insurance companies and from self-insurance We compete with global, national and local insurance companies, including direct writers of insurance coverage as well as non-insurance financial services companies, such as banks and broker-dealers, many of which are able or willing to offer alternative products or more competitive pricing. Some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial, technical and operating resources. The general insurance industry is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service. There are many companies competing for the same insurance customers in the geographic areas in which we operate. If our competitors price their premiums more aggressively and we choose to beat or match their pricing, this may adversely affect our underwriting results. Should we choose not to do so the volume of premiums we write will be reduced. In addition, because our insurance products are often marketed through independent insurance agencies which represent more than one insurance company, we face competition within each agency. We also face competition from the implementation of self-insurance in the commercial insurance area. Many of our customers and potential customers are examining the risks of self-insuring as an alternative to traditional insurance. Changes in foreign exchange rates may impact our results We publish our consolidated financial statements in pounds sterling. Therefore, fluctuations in exchange rates used to translate other currencies, particularly other European currencies and the Canadian and U.S. dollar, into pounds sterling will impact our reported consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from period to period. These fluctuations in exchange rates will also impact the pound sterling value of our investments and the return on our investments. For a discussion of the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our results of operations for each of 2005 and 2004, see Item 11Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 14 Back to Contents
