Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following risks should be read in conjunction with other information contained, or incorporated by reference, in this report, including the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section and our consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. General Risks Our annual operating results and stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance. The market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including: • changes in rates by payers; • changes in Medicaid rules or regulations; • the development of increased competition; 15 • price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market; • changes in the competitive landscape of the market for our services, including new entrants to the market; • changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock; • ratings downgrades by any securities analysts who follow our common stock; • the public's response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC; • market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole; • the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock; • future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders; • other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters or responses to these events; and • changes in accounting principles. In addition, the stock markets, and in particular the NASDAQ Global Market, have experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs, and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business. The domestic economic downturn in recent years and current uncertain economic environment could cause a severe disruption in our operations. Our business could be negatively impacted by significant domestic economic downturns or an uncertain economic environment. If this uncertainty is prolonged or economic conditions worsen, there could be several severely negative implications to our business that may exacerbate many of the risk factors we identified below including, but not limited to, the following: Liquidity • The domestic economic uncertainty could continue or worsen and reduce liquidity and this could have a negative impact on financial institutions and the country’s financial system, which could, in turn, have a negative impact on our financial position. • We may not be able to borrow additional funds under our current credit facilities and may not be able to expand our current facility if participating lenders become insolvent, their liquidity is limited or impaired, or if we fail to meet covenant levels going forward. In addition, we may not be able to renew our existing credit facility at the conclusion of its current term, particularly if its maturity is accelerated as discussed below, or renew it on terms that are favorable to us. Demand • The recent recession has resulted in severe job losses, which could cause an increase in demand for our services. However, depending on the severity of the recession’s impact on our payers, particularly our state government payers, sufficient funds may not be allocated to compensate us for the services we provide at the current margins, or we may be required to provide more services to a growing population of beneficiaries without a corresponding increase in fees for these services. Prices • Certain markets have experienced, and may continue to experience, economic contraction, which could negatively impact our average fees and revenue. 16 While we obtain some of our business through responses to government requests for proposals (“RFPs”), we may not be awarded contracts through this process in the future, and contracts we are awarded may not be profitable. We obtain, and will continue to seek to obtain, a significant portion of our business from state or local government entities. To obtain business from government entities, we are often required to respond to RFPs. To propose effectively, we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract, the time required to establish operations and the terms of the proposals submitted by competitors. We must also assemble and submit a large volume of information within rigid and often short timetables. Our ability to respond successfully to RFPs will greatly impact our business. We may not be awarded contracts through the RFP process, and our proposals may not result in profitable contracts. If we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with officials of government entities and agencies, we may not be able to successfully procure or retain government-sponsored contracts, which could negatively impact our revenues. To facilitate our ability to procure or retain government-sponsored contracts, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to the government entities and agencies prior to the development of an RFP or program for privatization of human services and enhance our chances of procuring contracts with these payers. The effectiveness of our relationships may be reduced or eliminated with changes in the personnel holding various government offices or staff positions. We also may lose key personnel who have these relationships. We may be unable to successfully manage our relationships with government entities and agencies and with elected officials and appointees. Any failure to establish, maintain or manage relationships with government and agency personnel may hinder our ability to procure or retain government-sponsored contracts. Government unions may oppose privatizing government programs to outside vendors such as us, which could limit our market opportunities. Our success depends in part on our ability to win contracts to administer and manage programs traditionally administered by government employees. Many government employees, however, belong to labor unions with considerable financial resources and lobbying networks. These unions could apply opposing political pressure on legislators and other officials seeking to privatize government programs. Union opposition could result in our losing government contracts or being precluded from providing services under government contracts, or maintaining or renewing existing contracts. The ability to renew and obtain new contracts is critical to our financial success. If we could not renew certain contracts, or obtain new contracts, due to opposition political actions, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. Inaccurate, misleading or negative media coverage could damage our reputation and harm our ability to procure government sponsored contracts. The media sometimes provides news coverage about our contracts and the services we provide to clients. This media coverage, if negative, could influence government officials to slow the pace of privatizing government services. Moreover, inaccurate, misleading or negative media coverage about us could harm our reputation and, accordingly, our ability to obtain government sponsored contracts. Our business is subject to risks of litigation. We are in the human services and non-emergency transportation services businesses which are subject to lawsuits and claims. A substantial award could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows, and could adversely impact our ability to continue to purchase appropriate liability insurance. We can be subject to claims for negligence or intentional misconduct (in addition to professional liability type claims) by an employee or a third party we engage to assist with the provision of services, including but not limited to, claims arising out of accidents involving vehicle collisions, and various claims that could result from employees or contracted third parties driving to or from interactions with clients and while providing direct client services. We are also subject to claims alleging we did not properly treat an individual or failed to properly diagnose and/or care for a client. We can be subject to employee related claims such as wrongful discharge or discrimination or a violation of equal employment laws and permitting issues. While we are insured for these types of claims, damages exceeding our insurance limits or outside our insurance coverage, such as a claim for fraud, certain wage and hour violations or punitive damages, could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition. 17 Furthermore, we can be subject to miscellaneous errors and omissions liability relative to the various management agreements we have with the not-for-profit entities we manage. In the event of a claim, and depending on, among other things, the circumstances, allegations, and size of the management contract, we could be subject to damages that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. We face substantial competition in attracting and retaining experienced professionals, particularly professionals with respect to our human services, and intellectual technology professionals with respect to our non-emergency transportation services, and we may be unable to sustain or grow our business if we cannot attract and retain qualified employees. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced professionals who possess the skills and experience necessary to deliver high quality services to our clients. Our objective of providing the highest quality of service to our clients is a significant consideration when we evaluate education, experience and qualifications of potential candidates for employment as direct care and administrative staff. To that end, we attempt to hire professionals who have attained a bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, or higher level of education and certification or licensure as direct care social services providers and administrators. These employees are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. We must quickly hire project leaders and case management personnel after a contract is awarded to us. Contract provisions and client needs determine the number, education and experience levels of social services professionals we hire. We continually evaluate client census, case loads and client eligibility to determine our staffing needs under each contract. Our performance in our non-emergency transportation services business largely depends on the talents and efforts of our highly skilled intellectual technology professionals. Competition for skilled intellectual technology professionals can be intense. Our success depends on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate these individuals. Our ability to attract and retain employees with the requisite experience and skills depends on several factors including, but not limited to, our ability to offer competitive wages, benefits and professional growth opportunities. Some of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater financial, technical, political and marketing resources, name recognition and a larger number of clients and payers than we do. The inability to attract and retain experienced personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our success depends on our ability to manage growing and changing operations. Since 1996, our business has grown significantly in size and complexity. This growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, significant demands on our management, systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. In addition, we expect that we will need to further develop our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems to accommodate future growth. This could require us to incur significant expense for, among other things, hiring additional qualified personnel, retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our information technology infrastructure. The nature of our business is such that qualified management personnel can be difficult to find. Our inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Our success depends on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace. In our Human Services segment, we compete for clients and for contracts with a variety of organizations that offer similar services. Most of our competition consists of local human services organizations that compete with us for local contracts. Other competitors include local not-for-profit organizations and community based organizations. Historically, these types of organizations have been favored in our industry as incumbent providers of services to government entities. We also compete with larger companies and institutional providers that offer community based care services. Some of these companies have greater financial, technical, political, marketing, name recognition and other resources and a larger number of clients or payers than we do. In addition, some of these companies offer more services than we do. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition from new entrants into the markets in which we operate our human services business. Increased competition may result in pricing pressures, loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of clients or payers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 18 In our NET Services segment, we compete with a variety of organizations that provide similar non-emergency transportation management services to Medicaid eligible beneficiaries in local markets. Our competitors largely compete for smaller-scale contract opportunities that encompass smaller geographic areas. For example, most of our competitors seek to win contracts for specific counties, whereas we seek to win contracts for the entire state. If these competitors begin to compete on a larger scale basis, it could result in pricing pressures, loss of, or failure to gain, market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our business is subject to security breaches and attacks. We provide human services and therefore our information technology systems store client information protected by numerous federal and state regulations. Since our systems include interfaces to third-party stakeholders, often connected via the Internet, we are subject to cyber security risks. The nature of our business, where services are often performed outside a secured location, adds additional risk. While we have implemented measures to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks, our measures may not be effective. As a result of any security breach or loss of data, we could incur liability, regulatory actions, fines or litigation, which could increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Further, any such breach or loss could impact our business reputation and could result in the loss of contractual relationships or make it more difficult to obtain new contracts, having an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. Regulatory Risks We conduct business in a heavily regulated healthcare industry. Compliance with existing regulations is costly, and changes in regulations or violations of regulations may result in increased costs or sanctions that could reduce our revenue and profitability. The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation relating to, among other things: ● professional licensure; ● conduct of operations; ● addition of facilities, equipment and services, including certificates of need; ● coding and billing for services; and ● payment for services. Both federal and state government agencies have increased coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts related to the healthcare industry. Regulations related to the healthcare industry are extremely complex and, in many instances, the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of those laws. Medicare and Medicaid anti-fraud and abuse laws prohibit certain business practices and relationships related to items and services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce or arrange for referral of patients or recommendation for the provision of items or services covered by Medicare or Medicaid or any other federal or state healthcare program. Federal and state laws prohibit the submission of false or fraudulent claims, including claims to obtain reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid. We have implemented compliance policies to help assure our compliance with these regulations as they become effective; however, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations in the future could subject our practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services or the manner in which we conduct our business. 19 We could be subject to actions for false claims if we do not comply with government coding and billing rules, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. If we fail to comply with federal and state documentation, coding and billing rules, we could be subject to criminal and/or civil penalties, loss of licenses and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. In billing for our services to third-party payers, we must follow complex documentation, coding and billing rules. These rules are based on federal and state laws, rules and regulations, various government pronouncements, and on industry practice. Failure to follow these rules could result in potential criminal or civil liability under the federal False Claims Act, under which extensive financial penalties can be imposed and/or under various state statutes which prohibit the submission of false claims for services covered. Compliance failure could further result in criminal liability under various federal and state criminal or civil statutes. While we plan to carefully and regularly review our documentation, coding and billing practices, the rules are frequently vague and confusing and we cannot assure that governmental investigators, private insurers or private whistleblowers will not challenge our practices. Such a challenge could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. If we fail to comply with the federal Anti-kickback Statute, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, loss of licenses and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. The federal Anti-kickback Statute prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for or recommending the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items or services payable by a federally funded healthcare program. Any of our financial relationships with healthcare providers will be potentially implicated by this statute to the extent Medicare or Medicaid referrals are implicated. Violations of the Anti-kickback Statute could result in substantial civil or criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $25,000 per violation, imprisonment of up to five years, civil penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a) of up to $50,000 per violation, plus three times the remuneration involved, civil penalties under the False Claims Act of up to $11,000 for each claim submitted, plus three times the amounts paid for such claims and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such penalties could have a significant negative effect on our operations. Furthermore, the exclusion, if applied to us, could result in significant reductions in our revenues, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of our operations. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-kickback Statute with similar penalties. If we fail to comply with physician self-referral laws, to the extent applicable to our operations, we could experience a significant loss of reimbursement revenue. We may be subject to federal and state statutes and regulations banning payments for referrals of patients and referrals by physicians to healthcare providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship and billing for services provided pursuant to such referrals if any occur. Violation of these federal and state laws and regulations, to the extent applicable to our operations, may result in prohibition of payment for services rendered, loss of licenses, fines, criminal penalties and exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs. To the extent we do maintain such financial relationships with physicians, we rely on certain exceptions to self-referral laws that we believe will be applicable to such arrangements. Any failure to comply with such exceptions could result in the penalties discussed above. We are subject to regulations relating to privacy and security of patient information. Failure to comply with privacy regulations could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results. There are numerous federal and state regulations addressing patient information privacy and security concerns. In particular, the federal regulations issued under HIPAA contain provisions that: ● protect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of patient information; ● require the implementation of security safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form; and ● prescribe specific transaction formats and data code sets for certain electronic healthcare transactions. Compliance with state and federal laws and regulations is costly and requires our management to expend substantial time and resources. Further, the HIPAA regulations and state privacy laws expose us to increased regulatory risk, as the penalties associated with a failure to comply, even if unintentional, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 20 We have an internal committee to maintain our privacy and security policies regarding client information in compliance with HIPAA. This committee is responsible for training our employees, including our regional and local managers and staff, to comply with HIPAA and monitoring compliance with the policy. The costs associated with our ongoing compliance could be substantial, which could negatively impact our results of operations. As a government contractor, we are subject to an increased risk of litigation and other legal actions and liabilities. As a government contractor, we are subject to an increased risk of investigation, criminal prosecution, civil fraud, whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities that are not as frequently experienced by companies that do not provide government sponsored services. The occurrence of any of these actions, regardless of the outcome, could disrupt our operations and result in increased costs, and could limit our ability to obtain additional contracts in other jurisdictions. The federal government may refuse to grant consents or waivers necessary to permit for-profit entities to perform certain elements of government programs. Under current law, in order to privatize certain functions of government programs, the federal government must grant a consent or waiver to the petitioning state or local agency. If the federal government does not grant a necessary consent or waiver or withdraws approval of any granted waiver, the state or local agency will be unable to contract with a for-profit entity, such as us, to provide service. Failure by state or local agencies to obtain consents or waivers could adversely affect our continued business operations and future growth. Our business could be adversely affected by future legislative changes that hinder or reverse the privatization of human services or non-emergency transportation services. The market for our services depends largely on federal, state and local legislative programs. These programs can be modified or amended at any time. Moreover, part of our growth strategy includes aggressively pursuing opportunities created by the federal, state and local initiatives to privatize the delivery of human services and non-emergency transportation services. However, there are opponents to the privatization of these services and, as a result, future privatization is uncertain. If additional privatization initiatives are not proposed or enacted, or if previously enacted privatization initiatives are challenged, repealed or invalidated, there could be a material adverse impact on our operating results. Our strategic relationships with certain not-for-profit and tax exempt entities are subject to tax and other risks. Since some government agencies in certain of our markets prefer or require contracts for privatized human services to be administered through not-for-profit organizations, we rely on our long-term relationships with not-for-profit organizations to provide services to these government agencies. We currently maintain strategic relationships with several not-for-profit social services organizations with which we have management contracts of varying lengths, the majority of which are federally tax exempt organizations. Our strategic relationships with tax exempt not-for-profit organizations are similar to those in the hospital management industry where tax exempt or faith based not-for-profit hospitals are managed by for-profit companies. Federal tax law requires that the boards of directors of not-for-profit tax exempt organizations be independent. The boards of directors of the tax exempt not-for-profit organizations for which we provide management services have a majority of independent members. The board members are predominately selected from independent members of the local community in which the not-for-profit entity operates. Decisions regarding our business relationships with these not-for-profit entities are made by their independent board members including approving the management fees we charge to manage their organizations and any discretionary bonuses. Federal tax law also requires that the management fees we charge the not-for-profit entities we manage be fixed and at fair market rates. Typically a fairness opinion is obtained by the not-for-profit entities we manage from an independent third party valuation consultant that substantiates the fair market rates. If the Internal Revenue Service determined that any tax exempt organization was paying more than market rates for services performed by us, the managed entity could lose its tax exempt status and owe back taxes and penalties. Generally, under state law, not-for-profit entities may pay no more than reasonable compensation for services rendered. If the compensation paid to us by these not-for-profit entities is deemed unreasonable, then the state could take action against the not-for-profit entity, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. 21 Our business is subject to state licensing regulations and other regulatory provisions, including regulatory provisions governing surveys and audits. Changes to, or violations of, these regulations could negatively impact our revenues. In many of the locations where we operate, we are required by state law to obtain and maintain licenses. The applicable state and local licensing requirements govern the services we provide, the credentials of staff, record keeping, treatment planning, client monitoring and supervision of staff. The failure to maintain these licenses or the loss of a license could have a material adverse impact on our business and could prevent us from providing services to clients in a given jurisdiction. Most of our contracts are subject to surveys or audit by our payers. We are also subject to regulations that restrict our ability to contract directly with a government agency in certain situations. Such restrictions could affect our ability to contract with certain payers, and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Financial Risks Our indebtedness may harm our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2013, our total consolidated long-term debt was $123.5 million. On August 2, 2013, we refinanced our then existing debt under an amended and restated credit agreement providing for a $60.0 million term loan and a $165.0 million revolving credit facility. Under the repayment terms of the amended and restated credit agreement, we are obligated to repay the principal amount of the term loan as follows: $3.0 million between December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015, $4.5 million between December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, $6.0 million between December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, $6.8 million between December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2018 and $39.7 million at maturity in August 2018. As discussed below, the maturity date of our credit facility could be accelerated. Our level of indebtedness could have a material adverse impact to our business: • it could adversely affect our ability to satisfy our obligations; • it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future; • it may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and • it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general. Our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt. If we were to fail to make any required payment under the agreements governing our indebtedness, or fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in these agreements, we could be in default. In the event we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants, it is uncertain whether the lenders will grant waivers for our non-compliance. Our lenders would have the ability to require that we immediately pay all outstanding indebtedness. If our lenders were to require immediate payment, we might not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under our credit facility, or our 6.5% convertible senior subordinated notes due in 2014 (“Senior Notes”). In such event, we could be forced to seek protection under bankruptcy laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our existing contracts and our ability to procure new contracts as well as our ability to recruit and/or retain employees. Accordingly, a default could have a significant adverse effect on the market value and marketability of our common stock. Changes in budgetary priorities of the government entities that fund the services we provide could result in our loss of contracts or a decrease in amounts payable to us under our contracts. Our revenue is largely derived from contracts that are directly or indirectly paid or funded by government agencies. All of these contracts are subject to legislative appropriations and state budget approval. The availability of funding under our contracts with state governments is dependent in part upon federal funding to states. Changes in Medicaid methodology may further reduce the availability of federal funds to states in which we provide services. Among the alternative Medicaid funding approaches that states have explored are provider assessments as tools for leveraging increased Medicaid federal matching funds. Provider assessment plans generate additional federal matching funds to the states for Medicaid reimbursement purposes, and implementation of a provider assessment plan requires approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in order to qualify for federal matching funds. These plans usually take the form of a bed tax or a quality assessment fee, which were historically required to be imposed uniformly across classes of providers within the state, except that such taxes only applied to Medicaid health plans. 22 However, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, or Deficit Reduction Act, requires states that desire to impose provider taxes to impose taxes on all managed care organizations, not just Medicaid managed care organizations. This uniformity requirement as it relates to taxing all managed care organizations may make states more reluctant to use provider assessments as a vehicle for raising matching funds and, thus, reduce the amount of funding that the states receive and have available. Moreover, under the Deficit Reduction Act, states may be allowed to reduce the benefits provided to certain Medicaid enrollees, which could affect the services that states contract for with us. We cannot make any assurances that these Medicaid changes will not negatively affect the funding under our contracts. As funding under our contracts is dependent in part upon federal funding, such funding changes could have a significant effect upon our business. Currently, many of the states in which we operate are facing budgetary shortfalls or changes in budgetary priorities. In addition, in some states eligibility requirements for human services clients have been tightened to stabilize the number of eligible clients and in certain instances states have implemented or are considering implementing a single point of access to care or a managed care model, which reduces the size of our potential market in those states. While many of these states are dealing with budgetary concerns by shifting costs from institutional care to home and community based care such as we provide, there is no assurance that this trend will continue. Consequently, a significant decline in government expenditures, shift of expenditures or funding away from programs that call for the types of services that we provide, or change in government contracting or funding policies could cause payers to terminate their contracts with us or reduce their expenditures under those contracts, either of which could have a negative impact on our operating results. We derive a significant amount of our revenues from a few payers, which puts us at risk. Any changes in the funding, financial viability or our relationships with these payers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We provide, or manage the provision of, government sponsored human services and non-emergency transportation services to individuals and families who are eligible for government assistance pursuant to federal mandate with respect to government sponsored human services and members of the disability community, or senior citizens with respect to non-emergency transportation services under various contracts with state and local governmental entities. We generate a significant amount of our revenues from a few payers under a small number of contracts. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we generated approximately 48.0%, 48.5% and 48.6%, respectively, of our total revenue from our top ten payers. Additionally, our top five payers related to our NET Services operating segment represent, in the aggregate, approximately 43.6%, 43.2% and 49.2%, respectively, of our NET Services operating segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The top five payers related to our Human Services operating segment represent, in the aggregate, approximately 38.0%, 38.5% and 38.4%, respectively, of our Human Services operating segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The loss of, reduction in amounts generated by, or changes in methods or regulations governing payments for our services under these contracts could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations. Our contracts are in many instances short-term in nature, and can also be terminated prior to expiration, without cause and without penalty to the payers. There can be no assurance that they will survive until the end of their stated terms, or that upon their expiration these contracts will be renewed or extended. Disruptions to our contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Most of our Human Services contracts contain base periods of only one year. While some of them also contain options for renewal, usually successive six month or one year terms, payers are not required to extend their contracts into these option periods. In addition, a significant number of our Human Services contracts not only allow the payer to terminate the contract immediately for cause (such as for our failure to meet our contract obligations) but also permit the payer to terminate the contract at any time prior to its stated expiration date. In most cases the payer may terminate the Human Services or NET Services contracts without cause, at will and without penalty to the payer, either immediately or upon the expiration of a short notice period in the event government appropriations supporting the programs serviced by the contract are reduced or eliminated. The failure of payers to renew or extend significant contracts or their early termination of significant contracts could adversely affect our financial performance. We cannot anticipate if, when or to what extent a payer might terminate its contract with us prior to its expiration or fail to renew or extend its contract with us. 23 Each of our contracts is subject to audit and modification by the payers with whom we contract, at their sole discretion. Our business depends on our ability to successfully perform under various government funded contracts. Under the terms of these contracts, payers can review our performance, as well as our records and general business practices at any time, and may, in their discretion: • suspend or prevent us from receiving new contracts or extending existing contracts because of violations or suspected violations of procurement laws or regulations; • terminate or modify our existing contracts; • reduce the amount we are paid under our existing contracts; and/or • audit and object to our contract related fees. If payers have significant audit findings, or if they make material modifications to our contracts, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. A loss of our status as a licensed provider in any jurisdiction could result in the termination of a number of our contracts, which could negatively impact our revenues. Our status as a licensed provider of health services is subject to periodic renewal, review and examination by federal, state and local agencies. If we lost our status as a licensed provider in any jurisdiction, the contracts under which we provide services in that jurisdiction could be subject to termination. Moreover, such an event could constitute a violation of provisions of our contracts in other jurisdictions, resulting in further contract terminations. If we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations, we could be liable for damages and financial penalties, and it could harm our ability to keep our existing contracts or obtain new contracts. Our failure to comply with our contract obligations could, in addition to providing grounds for immediate termination of the contract for cause, negatively impact our financial performance and damage our reputation, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain current contracts or obtain new ones. Our failure to meet contractual obligations could also result in substantial actual and consequential financial damages. The termination of a contract for cause could, for instance, subject us to liabilities for excess costs incurred by a payer in obtaining similar services from another source. In addition, our contracts require us to indemnify payers for our failure to meet standards of care, and some of them contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties that we must pay if we breach these contracts. If we fail to estimate accurately the cost of performing certain contracts, we may experience reduced or negative margins. Under our fee-for-service contracts, we receive fees based on our interactions with government sponsored clients. To earn a profit on these contracts, we must accurately estimate costs incurred in providing services. Our risk on these contracts is that our client population is not large enough to cover our fixed costs, such as rent and overhead. Our fee-for-service contracts are not reimbursed on a cost basis and therefore, if we fail to estimate our costs accurately, we may experience reduced margins, or even losses on these contracts. Additionally, approximately 83.4%, 83.3% and 87.6% of our non-emergency transportation services revenue during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, was generated under capitated contracts with the remainder generated through fee-for service and fixed cost contracts. Under most of our capitated contracts, we assume the responsibility of managing the needs of a specific geographic population by contracting out transportation services to local van, cab and ambulance companies on a per ride or per mile basis. We use a “pricing model” to determine applicable contract rates, which take into account factors, such as estimated utilization, state specific data, previous experience in the state and/or with similar services, estimated volume and availability of mass transit. The amount of the fixed per member, per month fee is determined in the bidding process, but predicated on actual historical transportation data for the subject geographic region (provided by the payer), actuarial work performed in-house as well as by third party actuarial firms and actuarial analyses provided by the payer. If the utilization of our services is more than we estimated, the contract may be less profitable than anticipated, or may not be profitable at all. 24 We record revenue from cost-based service contracts based on a combination of direct costs, indirect overhead allocations, and stated contractual margins on those costs. We may be required to subsequently refund a portion of the excess funds, if any. Our cost-based service contracts require us to allow for contingencies such as budgeted costs not incurred, excess cost per service over the allowable contract rate and/or an insufficient number of encounters. In cases where funds paid to us exceed the allowable costs to provide services under the contracts, we may be required to pay back the excess funds. While we believe we have adequately reserved for potential refund amounts, the final settlement of certain contract reimbursements can sometimes occur at a significantly later date than the period services were provided. It is possible that we are unaware of certain potential refunds until they occur which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. Approximately 20.3%, 18.6% and 19.3% of our Human Services segment revenues or approximately 6.4%, 6.0% and 7.4% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were derived from cost-based service contracts. Our results of operations will continue to fluctuate due to seasonality. Our quarterly operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business. In our Human Services operating segment, lower client demand for our home and community based services during the holiday and summer seasons generally results in lower revenue during those periods; however, our expenses related to the Human Services operating segment do not vary significantly with these changes. As a result, our Human Services operating segment typically experiences lower operating margins during the holiday and summer seasons. Our NET Services operating segment also experiences fluctuations in demand for our non-emergency transportation services during the summer, winter and holiday seasons. Due to higher demand in the summer months and lower demand in the winter and holiday seasons, coupled with a fixed revenue stream based on a per member per month based structure, our NET Services operating segment typically experiences lower operating margins in the summer season and higher operating margins in the winter and holiday seasons. We expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the seasonal demand for our home and community based services and non-emergency transportation services. As we enter new markets and expand our business, we could be subject to additional seasonal variations. Our reported financial results could suffer if there is an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. Goodwill may be impaired if the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units is less than the carrying value of the respective reporting unit. Because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets. We perform an analysis on our goodwill balances to test for impairment on an annual basis. Similarly, interim impairment tests may also be required in advance of our annual impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value, including goodwill, of one or more of our reporting units below the reporting unit’s carrying value. Such circumstances could include but are not limited to: (1) loss of significant contracts, (2) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the climate of our business, (3) unanticipated competition, (4) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, or (5) a significant decline in our stock price. If events occur or circumstances change, we may be required to record an impairment adjustment to our goodwill or other intangible assets which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. We may incur costs before receiving related revenues, which could result in cash shortfalls. When we are awarded a contract to provide services, we may incur expenses before we receive any contract payments. These expenses include leasing office space, purchasing office equipment and hiring personnel. As a result, in certain large contracts where the government does not fund program start-up costs, we may be required to invest significant sums of money before receiving related contract payments. In addition, payments due to us from payers may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures to approve government budgets in a timely manner. Moreover, especially under fee-for-service arrangements, any resulting cash shortfall could be exacerbated if we fail to either invoice the payer or to collect our fee in a timely manner. This could have a material adverse impact on our ongoing operations and our financial position. 25 Our use of a reinsurance program to cover certain claims for losses suffered and costs or expenses incurred could negatively impact our business. We are reinsured with regard to a substantial portion of our automobile, general liability, professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance. We also reinsure the general liability, professional liability, workers’ compensation insurance, automobile liability and automobile physical damage of various members of the network of subcontracted transportation providers and independent third parties over various policy years under reinsurance programs through our two wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries. Although, effective February 15, 2011, we did not renew our reinsurance agreement and will not assume liabilities for policies that cover the general liability, automobile liability, and automobile physical damage coverage of our independent third party transportation providers after that date, we will continue to administer existing policies for the foreseeable future and resolve remaining and future claims related to these policies. In the event that actual reinsured losses increase unexpectedly or exceed actuarially determined estimated reinsured losses under the program, the aggregate of such losses could materially increase our liability and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, as the availability to us of certain traditional insurance coverage diminishes or increases in cost, we will continue to evaluate the levels and types of insurance we include in our self-insurance program. Any increase to this program increases our risk exposure and therefore increases the risk of a possible material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations. Any acquisition that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or have a material adverse impact on our operating results. We have made, and anticipate that we will continue making, strategic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. We have made a number of acquisitions since our inception. The success of these and other acquisitions depends in part on our ability to integrate acquired companies into our business operations. There can be no assurance that the companies acquired will continue to generate income at the historical levels on which we based our acquisition decisions, that we will be able to maintain or renew the acquired companies’ contracts, that we will be able to realize operating and economic efficiencies upon integration of acquired companies, or that the acquisitions will not adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. We continually review opportunities to acquire other businesses that would complement our current services, expand our markets or otherwise offer prospects for growth. In connection with our acquisition strategy, we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders’ percentage ownership, or we could incur or assume substantial debt or contingent liabilities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to, the following: • challenges assimilating the acquired operations; • unanticipated costs and known and unknown legal or financial liabilities associated with an acquisition; • diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses; • adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers; • entering markets in which we have limited or no experience; • potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations; • the incurrence of excessive leverage in financing an acquisition; • failure to maintain and renew contracts of the acquired business; • unanticipated operating, accounting or management difficulties in connection with an acquisition; and • dilution to our earnings per share. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisition and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business. 26 Fluctuations in gasoline prices could result in higher unit cost paid to our subcontracted network as well as higher utilization of our non-emergency transportation services which could negatively impact our operating margins. Fluctuating gasoline prices could result in more clients utilizing our non-emergency transportation services as they may be unable to economically sustain transportation of their own. This could result in increased costs and levels of service required under our capitated contracts, and could result in a loss of profitability in the segment. Rising gasoline prices could result in lower operating margins as we may not be able to pass on the costs charged by our transportation providers with whom we contract. Fluctuations in gasoline prices could adversely affect our operating results. International Risks Our international operations expose us to various risks that could have a negative impact on our operations or financial results. We operate in Canada through our wholly-owned subsidiary, WCG International Consultants Ltd., or WCG, and as a result, we are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business across national boundaries, any one of which could adversely impact our business. In addition to currency fluctuations, these risks include, among other things: • economic downturns; • changes in or interpretations of local law, governmental policy or regulation; • restrictions on the transfer of funds in to, or out of the country; • varying tax systems; • delays from doing business with governmental agencies; • nationalization of foreign assets; and • government protectionism. One or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations domestically or internationally, financial results or financial position. We may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws, and any determination that we violated any of these laws could have an adverse effect on our business. Our operations outside the United States are subject to the U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA. Generally, the FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect the transactions of the company. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel to comply with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Increased competition in British Columbia, Canada due to the service delivery system reorganization in 2012 could hinder our ability to gain new business and negatively impact our revenues related to our international operations. As part of the service delivery system reorganization that took place in British Columbia during 2012, all of the contracts for services in this market expired and new contracts were put up for bid. The new contracts combined federal and provincial funding streams and services which were previously contracted separately. As a result, WCG is experiencing an increase in competition as providers who contract for federal dollars have entered the market in which WCG operates. To date, due primarily to an increased level of competition and a decrease in the number of services funded in British Columbia, WCG has been unable to regain the level of business it experienced prior to the reorganization of the service delivery system. While WCG continues to pursue various business opportunities, there is no assurance that it will be able to achieve the operating level it did prior to 2012. Increased competition in this market may result in pricing pressures, loss of or failure to gain market share, any of which could have a negative impact on our international operations and financial results. 27 We operate and are in a taxable income position in multiple tax jurisdictions, and face the risk of double taxation if one jurisdiction does not acquiesce to the tax claims of another jurisdiction. We currently operate in the United States and Canada and are subject to income taxes in those countries and the specific states and/or provinces where we operate. In the event one taxing jurisdiction disagrees with another taxing jurisdiction, we could experience temporary or permanent double taxation and increased professional fees to resolve taxation matters.
