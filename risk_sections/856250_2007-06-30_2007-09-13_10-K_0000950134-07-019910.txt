Item 1A. Risk Factors. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Companys management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Companys estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for the Companys conclusions. The Company continually evaluates the information used to make these estimates as its business and the economic environment changes. The Companys management believes that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on its financial statements, so the Company considers these to be its critical accounting policies. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized as product is shipped and related services are performed in accordance with all applicable revenue recognition criteria. For these transactions the Company applies the provisions of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Title generally transfers upon shipment of goods from the Companys warehouse. The Company does not have an obligation or policy of replacing customer products damaged or lost in transit. In some instances, the Company ships product directly from its suppliers to the customers. In these cases, the Company recognizes revenue when the product is accepted by the customers representative. The Company applies the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent. The Companys application of EITF 99-19 includes evaluation of its terms with each major customer relative to a number of criteria that management considers in making its determination with respect to gross versus net reporting of revenue for transactions with its customers. Managements criteria for making these judgments place particular emphasis on determining the primary obligor in a transaction and which party bears general inventory risk. The Company records all shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenue, and related costs as cost of sales, when incurred, in accordance with EITF 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs. As part of its revenue recognition policy, the Company records an accrual of estimated incentives payable to its customers as a reduction of revenue at the time the related revenues are recorded. The Company bases its estimates on contractual terms of the programs and estimated or actual sales to individual customers. Actual incentives payable in any future period are inherently uncertain and, thus, may differ from its estimates. If actual or expected incentives were significantly greater than the reserves the Company had established, the Company would record a reduction to net revenues in the period in which the Company made such determination. In addition to various incentive programs, from time to time, the Company is required to provide mark-down funds to certain of its mass retail customers to assist them in clearing slow-moving inventory. These mark-down funds are accrued as a reduction of revenue at the time that the related revenues are recorded. 18 Table of Contents The Company is also required to provide for the cost of labor associated with resetting store displays. Resets involve removing slow-moving inventory and replacing it with new products. Although reset costs are paid to third parties who perform the services, they are considered an incentive to our mass merchandise customers. For existing products that are replaced, the Company accrues an estimate for the cost as in increase to cost of goods sold in advance of the reset at the time that the related revenues are recorded. The Company bases its estimates on a number of factors, including information obtained from our clients about their future plans. The cost for any new products or space that is gained is expensed as incurred as an increase to cost of goods sold. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company regularly analyzes significant customer balances, and, when it becomes evident a specific customer will be unable to meet its financial obligations to the Company, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position, a specific allowance for doubtful account is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount that is believed reasonably collectible. The Company also records allowances for doubtful accounts for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer and historical experiences. If circumstances related to specific customers change, estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted. Inventories The Companys inventories are primarily comprised of finished goods and are recorded at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method. The Company provides estimated inventory allowances for excess, slow-moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value. These reserves are based on current assessments about future demands, market conditions and related management initiatives. If market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Goodwill The Company assesses the carrying values of goodwill annually or when circumstances dictate that the carrying value might be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is analyzed at the reporting unit level. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using discounted cash flow analysis. In the event that an impairment is determined to have occurred, the Company will reduce the carrying value of the asset in that period. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Companys financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, all expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax law or rates are considered. Deferred income taxes have been provided on unremitted earnings from foreign investees. The Company reviews its deferred tax assets for ultimate realization and will record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of these deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax authorities may not always agree with the tax positions taken by the Company. The Company believes it has adequate reserves in the event that a taxing authority differs with positions taken; however, there can be no assurance that the Companys results will not be affected adversely. See Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Variable Interest Entities Variable interest entities (VIEs) are primarily entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability. All VIEs with which the Company is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the VIE for financial reporting purposes. 19 Table of Contents The Company has a 50% ownership interest in Design Trends, a limited liability company. In connection with the adoption of FIN 46R, the Company concluded that Design Trends is a VIE and that the Company is the primary beneficiary. Pursuant to the provisions of FIN 46R, the Company consolidates Design Trends. Prior to the acquisition of Marketing Impressions, which became effective on July 1, 2006, the Company had a 50% ownership interest in PHI. The Company also concluded that PHI was a VIE and that the Company was the primary beneficiary. Pursuant to the provisions of FIN 46R, the Company consolidated PHI. Accordingly, the results of operations of PHI have historically been included in the consolidated income before minority interest of the Company. Prior to the acquisition, the minority interest in PHI income was excluded from the Companys consolidated net income. Since the effective date of the acquisition on July 1, 2006, no minority interest exists in PHI, and accordingly, the consolidated net income includes the full amount of PHI results from this date. Overview Management reviews a number of key indicators to evaluate the Companys financial performance, including net sales, gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses by segment. A condensed overview of results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 and the corresponding prior year period is summarized in the table that follows (in thousands, except percentage data). Fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 compared to fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 Income Statement by Segment (Dollars in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2007 June 30, 2006 Craftmade TSI Total Craftmade TSI Total Net sales $ 59,925 $ 43,425 $ 103,350 $ 62,902 $ 55,152 $ 118,054 Cost of goods sold (38,745 ) (32,314 ) (71,059 ) (40,361 ) (42,224 ) (82,585 ) Gross profit 21,180 11,111 32,291 22,541 12,928 35,469 Gross profit as a % of net sales 35.3 % 25.6 % 31.2 % 35.8 % 23.4 % 30.0 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (14,900 ) (6,251 ) (21,151 ) (13,449 ) (6,446 ) (19,895 ) As a % of net sales 24.9 % 14.4 % 20.5 % 21.4 % 11.7 % 16.9 % Depreciation and amortization (548 ) (251 ) (799 ) (575 ) (19 ) (594 ) Total operating expenses (15,448 ) (6,502 ) (21,950 ) (14,024 ) (6,465 ) (20,489 ) Income from operations 5,732 4,609 10,341 8,517 6,463 14,980 Interest expense, net (1,416 ) (25 ) (1,441 ) (1,104 ) (80 ) (1,184 ) Other expenses    (35 ) 35  Income before income taxes and minority interests 4,316 4,584 8,900 7,378 6,418 13,796 Provision for income taxes (1,469 ) (13 ) (1,482 ) (2,501 ) (765 ) (3,266 ) Income before minority interests 2,847 4,571 7,418 4,877 5,653 10,530 Minority interests  (1,507 ) (1,507 )  (3,430 ) (3,430 ) Net income $ 2,847 $ 3,064 $ 5,911 $ 4,877 $ 2,223 $ 7,100 Net Sales. Net sales for the Company decreased $14,704,000 or 12.5% to $103,350,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to $118,054,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, primarily from a decline in net sales of the TSI segment. Net sales from the Craftmade segment decreased $2,977,000 or 4.7% to $59,925,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, from $62,902,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. The decline was primarily due to a continued decrease in demand for decorative ceiling fans and Accolade lighting products as a result of the weak overall housing market. These decreases were partially offset by a 9.6% increase in net sales of Teiber product lines and an increase in net sales from the Durocraft product line consisting of clocks and weather gauges. 20 Table of Contents Management continues to focus on introducing new lighting products, expanding Teiber accounts and developing new accounts for the Durocraft product lines to offset the weak housing market. Management believes that long-term growth will be favorably affected by more competitive product sourcing and additional product offerings through enhanced product development efforts. Net sales of the TSI segment declined $11,727,000 or 21.3% to $43,425,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 from $55,152,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, as summarized in the following table: Net Sales of TSI Segment (Dollars in thousands) Trade Design Segment Fiscal Year Ended Source Trends Total June 30, 2007 $ 26,160 $ 17,265 $ 43,425 June 30, 2006 33,372 21,780 55,152 Dollar decrease $ (7,212 ) $ (4,515 ) $ (11,727 ) Percent decrease (21.6 %) (20.7 %) (21.3 %) The decrease in net sales of Trade Source was primarily the result of a decline in orders from Lowes related to indoor lighting, outdoor lighting and fan accessories. On November 13, 2006, Lowes notified Trade Source that it will no longer source the 14 indoor and outdoor lighting SKUs previously sold to Lowes via direct import. Management has been told that Lowes will be sourcing these products directly from various overseas manufacturers. Trade Source shipped all outstanding orders of discontinued products as of January 31, 2007. The decline in Design Trends net sales was primarily due to the previously disclosed reduction of SKUs sold to Lowes in the seven of 11 regional distribution centers that Design Trends supplied. Beginning in April 2006, Design Trends began providing approximately 60% of the SKUs in the mix and match portable lamp display set marketed under Lowes private label as compared to 100% in prior periods. Management also believes that the decrease in net sales of Design Trends resulted from reduced demand primarily due to current economic conditions related to the housing industry and other factors that are within the realm of the retailers control. This decline in Design Trends was partially offset by an increase in net sales to four additional Lowes distribution centers. In November 2006, Design Trends began supplying a portion of its mix and match portable lamps to the four additional Lowes regional distribution centers that Design Trends had not been supplying since the quarter ended September 30, 2005. As a result, Design Trends supplies mix and match portable lamps to all 11 Lowes regional distribution centers. Based on the most recent annual line review, management believes that Lowes remains committed to the lighting program with Design Trends. Management believes that based on the amount of product currently shipped to Lowes, Design Trends continues to be a primary portable lamp vendor for Lowes mix and match portable lamp program. Design Trends has been invited to participate in each of Lowes scheduled line reviews for its existing and new product lines. The line reviews occur throughout the year for each product category and give both Trade Source and Design Trends the potential to add new SKUs; however, participation in line reviews could also result in a partial or complete reduction of either subsidiarys existing SKUs in the product lines currently offered to Lowes. Management believes that the future growth of the TSI segment is contingent upon the success of the Companys ongoing efforts to introduce new products, product lines and marketing concepts to existing customers and to expand the business to new customers. Gross Profit. Gross profit of the Company as a percentage of net sales increased 1.2% to 31.2% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to 30.0% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the Craftmade segment of 35.3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was 0.5% lower than gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. An increase in net sales of product lines that carry a slightly lower gross profit as a percentage of net sales were offset by a non-recurring benefit obtained in the quarter ended March 31, 2006 from the recapture of duties related to prior periods as a result of an exemption of duties as prescribed by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). This non- 21 Table of Contents recurring benefit totaled $255,000. The AJCA contains a provision that allowed ceiling fans for permanent installation to enter the U.S. duty-free between November 6, 2004 and December 31, 2006. The provision was recently extended through December 31, 2009. For fiscal year 2008, management expects gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the Craftmade segment to slightly improve from the results generated in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, as Craftmade begins to realize the benefits obtained from its competitive sourcing efforts in China. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the TSI segment increased 2.2% to 25.6% of net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to 23.4% of net sales in the same prior year period, as summarized in the following table: Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales of TSI Trade Design Segment Fiscal Year Ended Source Trends Total June 30, 2007 25.6 % 25.5 % 25.6 % June 30, 2006 21.4 % 26.6 % 23.4 % Percent increase/(decrease) 4.2 % (1.1 %) 2.2 % Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased at Trade Source primarily due to the Companys acquisition of Marketing Impressions which allowed PHI to directly source certain of its fan accessory products. In addition, Trade Source benefited from lower costs associated with markdowns and product resets primarily as a result of the previously described loss of the indoor and outdoor lighting product orders by Lowes. On the other hand, Design Trends gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily as a result of higher amounts set aside for vendor programs with Lowes as compared to the prior fiscal year. For fiscal year 2008, gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the TSI segment is expected to remain consistent with the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, provided that the segment maintains a sales mix, customer concentration, and level of vendor program commitment similar to what it maintained during fiscal year 2007. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses of the Company increased $1,256,000 to $21,151,000 or 20.5% of net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to $19,895,000 or 16.9% of net sales for the same period last year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (Dollars in thousands) Increase/ Fiscal Year (Decrease) June 30, June 30, Over Prior 2007 2006 Year Period Advertising $ 2,161 $ 1,514 $ 647 Salaries and wages 7,135 6,821 314 Accounting, legal and consulting 2,237 2,065 172 Other 9,618 9,495 123 $ 21,151 $ 19,895 $ 1,256 The increase in advertising expenses primarily resulted from (i) an investment in Teiber product displays to support the increase in Teiber net sales, (ii) an increase in direct marketing to support the cornice window treatment program and (iii) an increase in catalog expense as a result of a new product catalog for Craftmade which introduced new ceiling fans and other products. Increases in salaries and wages primarily resulted from increases in salaries of current employees to remain competitive with market conditions. 22 Table of Contents Accounting, legal and consulting fees increased as a result of (i) consulting expense resulting from the acquisition of Marketing Impressions and (ii) increased legal and consulting fees from the Companys exploration of strategic alternatives. Management anticipates that based on current market conditions, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal year 2008 will be relatively consistent with results generated in fiscal year 2007. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense of the Company increased $205,000 to $799,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to $594,000 for the same period last year. The increase resulted from depreciation and amortization of the fixed assets, non-compete covenants and intellectual property obtained by the Company as a result of the acquisition of Marketing Impressions. See Note 3  Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Interest Expense. Net interest expense of the Company increased $257,000 to $1,441,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 from $1,184,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. This increase was primarily the result of (i) higher interest rates in effect during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to the prior fiscal year and (ii) higher average outstanding balances on the Companys sources of debt as a result of cash used to fund the acquisition of Marketing Impressions and increases in inventory due to the transition of ceiling fan manufacturing from Taiwan to China. Minority Interests. Minority interests decreased $1,923,000 to $1,507,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to $3,430,000 for the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease in minority interests resulted from the acquisition of Marketing Impressions which increased the Companys effective ownership of PHI to 100% and eliminated minority interest in connection with PHI. The decrease in minority interests was also impacted by decreased profits at Design Trends as a result of the decline in net sales as previously discussed. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income tax was $1,482,000 or 20.0% of income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to $3,266,000 or 31.5% of income before taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. The decrease in effective rate primarily resulted from anticipated refunds from lower state apportionment rates applied to prior periods and a reduction in amounts set aside for tax contingencies. See Note 5  Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Management anticipates that the Companys effective tax rate for fiscal year 2008 will return to more historical levels of approximately 34.5%. 23 Table of Contents Fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 compared to fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 Income Statement by Segment (Dollars in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2006 June 30, 2005 Craftmade TSI Total Craftmade TSI Total Net sales $ 62,902 $ 55,152 $ 118,054 $ 55,663 $ 63,143 $ 118,806 Cost of goods sold (40,361 ) (42,224 ) (82,585 ) (35,352 ) (48,008 ) (83,360 ) Gross profit 22,541 12,928 35,469 20,311 15,135 35,446 Gross profit as a % of net sales 35.8 % 23.4 % 30.0 % 36.5 % 24.0 % 29.8 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (13,449 ) (6,446 ) (19,895 ) (13,372 ) (7,131 ) (20,503 ) As a % of net sales 21.4 % 11.7 % 16.9 % 24.0 % 11.3 % 17.3 % Depreciation and amortization (575 ) (19 ) (594 ) (537 ) (44 ) (581 ) Total operating expenses (14,024 ) (6,465 ) (20,489 ) (13,909 ) (7,175 ) (21,084 ) Income from operations 8,517 6,463 14,980 6,402 7,960 14,362 Interest expense, net (1,104 ) (80 ) (1,184 ) (973 ) (108 ) (1,081 ) Other expenses (35 ) 35     Income before income taxes and minority interests 7,378 6,418 13,796 5,429 7,852 13,281 Provision for income taxes (2,501 ) (765 ) (3,266 ) (1,895 ) (1,184 ) (3,079 ) Income before minority interests 4,877 5,653 10,530 3,534 6,668 10,202 Minority interests  (3,430 ) (3,430 )  (3,775 ) (3,775 ) Net income $ 4,877 $ 2,223 $ 7,100 $ 3,534 $ 2,893 $ 6,427 Net Sales. Net sales for the Company decreased $752,000 or 0.6% to $118,054,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, compared to $118,806,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. The decrease in net sales resulted from a decrease in net sales of the TSI segment, partially offset by stronger net sales of the Craftmade segment. Net sales from the Craftmade segment increased $7,239,000 or 13.0% to $62,902,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 from $55,663,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. The increase resulted from $6,365,000 of incremental net sales from the product lines associated with the March 1, 2005 acquisition of Teiber as the Teiber customer base continues to expand. The current fiscal year includes 12 months of Teiber, compared to four months in the prior year. The remaining $874,000 increase in sales of the Craftmade segment resulted from an increase in sales partially due to newly-introduced products such as Durocraft gauges, the builder-targeted ceiling fans and Accolade lighting products. Net sales of the TSI segment declined $7,991,000 or 12.7% to $55,152,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 from $63,143,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. Increases in PHIs net sales were offset by decreases in Trade Source and Design Trends net sales, as summarized in the following table: Net Sales of TSI Segment (Dollars in thousands) TSI Trade Design Segment Fiscal Year Ended Source Trends PHI Total June 30, 2006 $ 20,334 $ 21,780 $ 13,038 $ 55,152 June 30, 2005 21,838 30,022 11,283 63,143 Dollar increase/(decrease) $ (1,504 ) $ (8,242 ) $ 1,755 $ (7,991 ) Percent increase/(decrease) (6.9 %) (27.5 %) 15.6 % (12.7 %) 24 Table of Contents The decrease in Trade Source net sales was primarily the result of a sales decline from the Wal-Mart indoor/outdoor lighting and mix and match fan program. Historically, Trade Source has provided Wal-Mart with these products by direct import from Asia. Wal-Mart now sources a significant amount of these products directly with the balance still being provided by Trade Source. The decrease in net sales also resulted from PHIs fan accessory sales in the current fiscal year that were made by Trade Source in the prior fiscal year. Strong sales of promotional lighting items, window covering treatments, and non-core products offset the decrease in net sales. The decline in Design Trends net sales was primarily due to the previously disclosed loss of four of Lowes 11 regional distribution centers in an attempt by Lowes to mitigate the risk associated with maintaining a sole supplier for a given product line, and a change in Lowes merchandising system. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, Lowes decided to change its merchandising concept to one that will be based on Lowes private label, which resulted in the discontinuance of the Design Trends merchandising display. The Company was asked to repurchase a portion of the existing inventory under the old Design Trends packaging and replace it with Lowes private label packaging. Design Trends agreed to replace a portion of the inventory and as a result, Design Trends initially offered and is currently offering approximately 60% of the items in the new set for the Lowes stores supplied by the seven of 11 regional distribution centers that it currently services. The increase in net sales of PHI primarily resulted from increased sales of the fan accessory and lamp replacement parts business to Lowes. Other increases in net sales over the prior year are due to PHIs sales of fan accessories to Wal-Mart that were made by Trade Source in the prior year. Gross Profit. Gross profit of the Company as a percentage of net sales increased 0.2% to 30.0% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, compared to 29.8% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the Craftmade segment decreased 0.7% to 35.8% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, compared to 36.5% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. The decline was primarily attributable to increased costs of goods sold as a result of the decline of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Taiwan dollar, an increase in sales of product lines that carry a slightly lower gross margin as a percentage of sales, and the costs associated with removing portable lamps as a product line and the related inventory. This was partially offset by benefits obtained in the fiscal year 2006 from the temporary exemption of the 4.7% duty on imported ceiling fans as prescribed by the AJCA. The AJCA contains a provision that allows ceiling fans for permanent installation to enter the U.S. duty-free between November 6, 2004 and December 31, 2006. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, the Company determined it was eligible for the duty exemption and received an estimated $945,000 benefit. In addition, the Company recovered an additional $255,000 of duties that is related to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. The gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the TSI segment decreased 0.6% to 23.4% of net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, compared to 24.0% of net sales in the same prior year period, as summarized in the following table: Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales of TSI Segment TSI Trade Design Segment Fiscal Year Ended Source Trends PHI Total June 30, 2006 13.5 % 26.6 % 33.7 % 23.4 % June 30, 2005 16.6 % 25.2 % 35.0 % 24.0 % Percent increase/(decrease) (3.1 %) 1.4 % (1.3 %) (0.6 %) Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased at Trade Source from a change in product mix. Design Trends gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from a change in product mix, offset by lower amounts set aside for vendor programs to Lowes. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased at PHI from a change in product mix. 25 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total SG&A expenses of the Company decreased $608,000 to $19,895,000, or 16.9% of net sales, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, compared to $20,503,000 or 17.3% of net sales for the prior fiscal year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (Dollars in thousands) Increase/ (Decrease) Fiscal Year Ended Over June 30, June 30, Prior Year 2006 2005 Period Salaries and wages $ 6,821 $ 6,220 $ 601 Accounting, legal and consulting 2,065 3,709 (1,644 ) Other 11,009 10,574 435 $ 19,895 $ 20,503 $ (608 ) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, the increase in salaries and wages over the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, resulted from higher salaries due to adjustments of current employees to remain competitive with market conditions as well as the addition of seven Teiber employees hired on March 1, 2005 (the current fiscal year includes 12 months of Teiber expenses, compared to four months in the prior fiscal year). There were 131 employees at June 30, 2006, compared to 130 employees at June 30, 2005. Lower accounting, legal and consulting fees in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 were primarily due to lower costs incurred to address internal controls issues and comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Section 404) as a result of implementing streamlined processes and efficiencies gained in year two and higher costs in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 to address internal control issues and the evaluation of FIN 46R with respect to the Companys 50% owned subsidiaries. Increases in other SG&A expenses of the Company primarily resulted from 12 months of Teiber expenses included in fiscal year 2006, compared to only four months in fiscal year 2005, offset by a decrease in other general expenses. Interest Expense. Net interest expense of the Company increased $103,000 to $1,184,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 from $1,081,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. This increase was primarily the result of higher interest rates in effect during the period on the Companys outstanding revolving line of credit with Frost Bank, offset by the effects of a reduction in overall interest-bearing debt. The average outstanding balance on the Companys facility note was lower during the 2006 fiscal year than during the 2005 fiscal year, while the interest rate on the facility note remained unchanged during the 2006 fiscal year compared to the 2005 fiscal year. Minority Interests. Minority interests generated by the Companys 50% owned subsidiaries decreased $345,000 to $3,430,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, compared to $3,775,000 for the same period in the previous year. The decrease was due to the decline in profit of Design Trends, partially offset by an increase in profit of PHI, as discussed above. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income tax was $3,266,000 or 31.5% of income before income taxes, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, compared to $3,079,000 or 32.4% of income before taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. The decrease in the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes primarily resulted from lower state taxes and the tax benefit obtained from the repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings under the AJCA. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for U.S. multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the U.S. at an effective tax rate of 5.25%, versus the U.S. federal statutory rate of 34%. The Company repatriated $9,225,000 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. Beginning in fiscal year 2007, the Company began recording foreign earnings at the full statutory rate and assumed that all foreign earnings would be repatriated. 26 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 The Companys cash decreased $1,236,000 from $2,164,000 at June 30, 2006 to $928,000 at June 30, 2007. Cash decreased as a result of the Company sweeping excess cash balances against its line of credit on a daily basis at PHI beginning in the quarter ended December 31, 2006, funds used to acquire Marketing Impressions and lower net income in the current fiscal year as compared to prior fiscal years. Net cash provided by the Companys operating activities decreased $792,000 to $7,042,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to $7,834,000 for the same period last year. The decrease in cash flow from operations resulted primarily from (a) lower net income, (b) lower accounts payable from the settlement of balances arising from the acquisition of Marketing Impressions and (c) a reduction in accrued customer allowances primarily from the loss of the indoor and outdoor lighting business with Lowes. These amounts were offset by lower accounts receivable and inventory balances driven in part by lower net sales in the current fiscal year. The $3,607,000 of cash used in investing activities was primarily related to the acquisition of Marketing Impressions and the ongoing upgrade of existing computer systems. Cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from (i) cash dividends of $2,498,000, (ii) distributions to minority interest members totaling $1,674,000 and (iii) principal payments on the Companys notes payable of $1,134,000. These amounts were offset by $671,000 of proceeds from our line of credit. The Companys management believes that its current lines of credit, combined with cash flows from operations, are adequate to fund the Companys current operating needs, debt service payments and any future dividend payments, as well as its projected growth over the next twelve months. In the event that the Company requires additional capital for growth, management believes that the Company can obtain favorable refinancing of its warehouse facility. There can be no assurances, however, that any type of financing arrangement will be consummated. Management anticipates that future cash flows will be used primarily to retire existing debt, pay dividends, fund potential acquisitions or other investments that will enhance long-term shareholder value and distribute earnings to its minority interest member. The Company remains committed to its business strategy of creating long-term earnings growth, maximizing stockholder value through internal improvements, making selective acquisitions and dispositions of assets, focusing on cash flow and retaining quality personnel. Management believes that given the current volatility in the housing and debt markets, it is in the best interest of long-term shareholder value to pursue selective and opportunistic acquisitions in order to achieve more advantageous growth objectives through enhanced product offerings and potentially expanding into adjacent product categories and sales channels, which will be less reliant on the overall housing environment. The Company is currently evaluating several acquisition candidates and is currently engaged in discussions with some of them. There can be no assurances, however, that any agreement will be reached or that any transaction will be consummated. 27 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The table below, as well as the information contained in Note 4  Long-Term Obligations and Note 9  Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements, summarizes the Companys various repayment requirements at June 30, 2007.

Lines of Credit and Notes Payable The Companys current revolving lines of credit and notes payable are summarized in the following table: Summary of Revolving Lines of Credit and Notes Payable At June 30, 2007 Outstanding Commitment Balance Interest Rate Maturity Revolving line of credit $ 30,000,000 $ 18,825,000 LIBOR plus 1.5% September 1, 2009 Note payable  facility N/A 223,000 8.302 % January 1, 2008 $ 19,048,000 On September 18, 2006, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the Frost Loan Agreement) with The Frost National Bank, San Antonio, Texas (Frost). The Frost Loan Agreement amends the Restated Loan Agreement dated October 31, 2005, between Craftmade and Frost. Also, on September 18, 2006, Craftmade executed a Revolving Promissory Note (the Note) payable to the order of Frost, in the principal amount of $30,000,000 or the amount equal to the borrowing base calculated on eligible accounts receivable and inventory, with an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.5%. The LIBOR rate in effect at June 30, 2007 was 5.32%. There was $4,505,000 available to borrow under the Note at June 30, 2007. The Note will mature on September 1, 2009. The Frost Loan Agreement contains financial covenants that require Craftmade to maintain a ratio of total liabilities (excluding any subordinated debt) to tangible net worth of not greater than 3.0 to 1.0 and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Frost Loan Agreement) of not less than 1.25 to 1.0, tested quarterly. The Company is in compliance with all of its covenants at June 30, 2007. Design Trends and all wholly-owned subsidiaries of Craftmade have agreed to be guarantors of the Frost Loan Agreement (the Guarantors). Craftmade and each of the Guarantors have granted a security interest to Frost in each of their accounts receivable and inventory. 28 Table of Contents At June 30, 2007, $223,000 remained outstanding under the note payable for the Companys 378,000 square foot operating facility. The loan is payable in equal monthly installments of $100,378 of principal and interest at 8.302%. The Companys management believes that this facility will be sufficient for its purposes for the foreseeable future. The facility note payable matures on January 1, 2008, but was fully repaid in August 2007. Management does not anticipate that the covenants and other restrictions contained in its lines of credit and loan agreements will limit the Companys current operations. Operating and Capital Lease Obligations Operating and capital lease obligations include rents for the Companys properties (see 
