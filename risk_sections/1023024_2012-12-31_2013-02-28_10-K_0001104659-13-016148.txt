ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following are significant factors known to BioSante that could materially harm its business, financial condition or operating results or could cause its actual results to differ materially from its anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statement made in this report: Risks Related to the Merger Between BioSante and ANI The issuance of shares of BioSante common stock to ANI stockholders in connection with the merger will dilute substantially the voting power of current BioSante stockholders. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, it is anticipated that BioSante will issue shares of BioSante common stock to ANI stockholders representing approximately 53 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company as of immediately following completion of the merger, assuming BioSantes net cash is $18.0 million as of the determination date. After such issuance, the shares of BioSante common stock outstanding immediately prior to completion of the merger will represent approximately 47 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company as of immediately following completion of the merger. These ownership percentages may change depending upon the amount of BioSantes net cash as of a determination date prior to completion of the merger. Accordingly, the issuance of shares of BioSante common stock to ANI stockholders in connection with the merger will reduce significantly the relative voting power of each share of BioSante common stock held by current BioSante stockholders. Consequently, the BioSante stockholders as a group will have significantly less influence over the management and policies of the combined company after the merger than prior to the merger. The exchange ratios in the merger agreement are subject to adjustment based on BioSantes net cash as of a determination date prior to completion of the merger, which could dilute further the ownership of the BioSante stockholders in the combined company. Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of and as a result of the merger, each share of ANI capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive that number of shares of BioSante common stock, if any, as determined pursuant to the exchange ratios described in the merger agreement and the provisions of ANIs certificate of incorporation. The exchange ratios are subject to potential adjustment as described in the merger agreement depending upon the amount of net cash of BioSante, as defined in the merger agreement and generally consisting of BioSantes cash and cash equivalents less certain expenses and liabilities, as of a determination date prior to the closing date of the merger. If BioSante has more than $18.0 million of net cash as of the determination date, then the percentage ownership of the current BioSante stockholders will be increased on a pro rata basis by 0.6 percent for each $1.0 million of net cash excess, which would dilute further the ownership of the current ANI stockholders in the combined company. If BioSante has less than $18.0 million of net cash as of the determination date, then the percentage ownership of current BioSante stockholders will be decreased on a pro rata basis by 0.6 percent for each $1.0 million of net cash shortfall, which would dilute further the ownership of the current BioSante stockholders in the combined company. In 19 Table of Contents no event, however, will the current ANI stockholders own less than 50.1 percent (or the current BioSante stockholders own more than 49.9 percent) of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company. In addition, one of the conditions to ANIs obligations to complete the merger is BioSantes net cash as of the closing date being no less than $17.0 million as calculated and as adjusted pursuant to the provisions of the merger agreement. The items that will constitute BioSantes net cash at the determination date set forth in the merger agreement are subject to a number of factors, some of which are outside the control of BioSante and many of which are outside the control of ANI. The exchange ratios are not adjustable based on issuances by BioSante of additional shares of BioSante common stock either upon the exercise of options or warrants or the conversion of convertible securities or otherwise, which issuances would result in additional dilution to the BioSante stockholders. As of December 31, 2012, BioSante had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 1.1 million shares of BioSante common stock, warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately 4.7 million shares of BioSante common stock, an aggregate of 65,211 shares of BioSante class C special stock that are convertible into 65,211 shares of BioSante common stock and an aggregate of $8.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.125% convertible senior notes due May 1, 2013 that are convertible into an aggregate of 370,871 shares of BioSante common stock. BioSante is not prohibited under the terms of the merger agreement from issuing additional equity securities under certain circumstances, including securities issued pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options or warrants or the conversion or exchange of outstanding convertible senior notes. It is possible that prior to completion of the merger BioSante may issue additional equity securities. The exchange ratios in the merger agreement, which are designed to result in the issuance by BioSante of shares of BioSante common stock to ANI stockholders representing approximately 53 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company as of immediately following completion of the merger, assuming BioSantes net cash is $18.0 million as of the determination date, are not adjustable based on issuances by BioSante of additional shares of BioSante common stock. Therefore, any such issuances by BioSante would result in additional dilution to the BioSante stockholders. The announcement and pendency of the merger could have an adverse effect on the trading price of BioSante common stock and/or the business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects for BioSante. While there have been no significant adverse effects to date, the announcement and pendency of the merger could disrupt BioSantes business in the following ways, among others: · third parties may seek to terminate and/or renegotiate their relationships with BioSante as a result of the merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with BioSante or otherwise; and · the attention of BioSante management may be directed toward completion of the merger and related matters and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations, including from other opportunities that otherwise might be beneficial to BioSante. Should they occur, any of these matters could adversely affect the trading price of BioSante common stock or harm the financial condition, results of operations or business prospects of BioSante and/or the combined company. Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact BioSantes business, financial condition or results of operations or the trading price of BioSante common stock. The completion of the merger is subject to a number of conditions and there can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the merger will be satisfied. If the merger is not completed, BioSante will be subject to several risks, including: 20 Table of Contents · the current trading price of BioSante common stock may reflect a market assumption that the merger will occur, meaning that a failure to complete the merger could result in a decline in the trading price of BioSante common stock; · certain executive officers and/or directors of BioSante may seek other employment opportunities, and the departure of any of BioSantes executive officers and the possibility that the company would be unable to recruit and hire an executive could impact negatively BioSantes business and operating results; · the BioSante board of directors will need to reevaluate BioSantes strategic alternatives, which alternatives may include a sale of the company, liquidation of the company or other strategic transaction; · BioSante may be required to reimburse ANI for expenses of up to $500,000 or pay a termination fee of $1.0 million to ANI if the merger agreement is terminated by ANI or BioSante under certain circumstances; · BioSante has incurred and is expected to continue to incur substantial transaction costs in connection with the merger whether or not the merger is completed; · BioSante would not realize any of the anticipated benefits of having completed the merger; and · under the merger agreement, BioSante is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completion of the merger, which restrictions could adversely affect its ability to realize certain of its business strategies or take advantage of certain business opportunities. If the merger is not completed, these risks may materialize and affect materially and adversely BioSantes business, financial condition, results of operations, or the trading price of BioSante common stock. BioSante has incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs in connection with the merger, some of which will be required to be paid even if the merger is not completed. BioSante has incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs in connection with the merger. These costs are primarily associated with the fees of its attorneys, accountants and financial advisor. Most of these costs will be paid by BioSante even if the merger is not completed. In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated due to certain triggering events specified in the merger agreement, BioSante may be required to pay ANI a termination fee of $1.0 million. The merger agreement also provides that under specified circumstances, BioSante may be required to reimburse ANI up to $500,000 for its expenses in connection with the transaction. If the merger is completed, the combined company will bear the transaction costs of both BioSante and ANI in connection with the merger, including financial advisor, legal and accounting fees and expenses. Because the merger will be completed after the date of the BioSante special meeting of stockholders, it is possible under certain limited circumstances described below that at the time of the special meeting, BioSante stockholders will not know the exact number of shares of BioSante common stock that the ANI stockholders will receive upon completion of the merger. Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each share of ANI capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger will be canceled, extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive that number of shares of BioSante common stock as determined pursuant to the exchange ratios described in the merger agreement. The exchange ratios depend on the net cash of BioSante as of a determination date prior to completion of the merger. The determination date is defined as the date that is 14 days prior to the date of the special meeting of BioSante stockholders, subject 21 Table of Contents to extension for adjournment of the special meeting and subject to a dispute resolution provisions in the event there is a dispute between BioSante and ANI as to the amount of net cash of BioSante as of the determination date. Under the merger agreement, BioSantes net cash is defined as generally consisting of BioSantes cash and cash equivalents less certain expenses and liabilities, as of a determination date prior to the closing date of the merger. In the event of a dispute regarding the amount of net cash of BioSante as of the determination date, it is possible that the exact number of shares of BioSante common stock that the ANI stockholders will receive upon completion of the merger may not be available at the time of the special meeting of BioSante stockholders. Some of the directors and executive officers of BioSante have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of the other BioSante stockholders. When considering the recommendation by the BioSante board of directors that the BioSante stockholders vote for each of the proposals being submitted to the BioSante stockholders at the special meeting of BioSante stockholders, the BioSante stockholders should be aware that certain of the directors and executive officers of BioSante have arrangements that provide them with interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of the stockholders of BioSante. For instance, in connection with the merger, Fred Holubow and Ross Mangano, each a current member of the BioSante board of directors, will continue to serve as a director of the combined company following completion of the merger and will receive cash and equity compensation in consideration for such service. The employment of BioSantes three executive officers will terminate immediately following completion of the merger and they will be entitled to receive severance cash payments ranging from $526,400 to $1,490,100, and other severance benefits such as continuing health insurance, in connection with such termination. The directors and executive officers of BioSante also have certain rights to indemnification and to directors and officers liability insurance that will be provided by the combined company following completion of the merger. The board of directors of BioSante was aware of these potential interests and considered them in making its recommendations to approve the proposals being submitted to the BioSante stockholders at the special meeting of BioSante stockholders. The merger agreement and voting agreements contain provisions that could discourage or make it difficult for a third party to acquire BioSante prior to completion of the merger. The merger agreement contains provisions that make it difficult for BioSante to entertain a third-party proposal for an acquisition of BioSante. These provisions include: · the general prohibition on BioSantes soliciting or engaging in discussions or negotiations regarding any alternative acquisition proposal; · the requirement that BioSante reimburse ANI for expenses of up to $500,000 or pay a termination fee of $1.0 million to ANI if the merger agreement is terminated by ANI or BioSante under certain circumstances; and · the requirement that BioSante submit the merger-related proposals to a vote of the BioSante stockholders even if the BioSante board of directors changes its recommendations with respect to such proposals. Pursuant to voting agreements entered into between (i) BioSante and certain stockholders of ANI and (ii) ANI and the directors, executive officers and certain stockholders of BioSante, each such director, executive officer and applicable stockholder has agreed not to take any actions that BioSante or ANI, as applicable, is prohibited from taking pursuant to the no-solicitation restrictions contained in the merger agreement. In addition, holders of shares representing approximately 85 percent of the shares of the outstanding ANI capital stock, calculated on an as-converted basis, and approximately 86 percent of the outstanding shares of the ANI series D preferred stock, as of October 3, 2012 are subject to a voting 22 Table of Contents agreement, pursuant to which the holders of such shares have agreed to vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, and ANI is required under the terms of the merger agreement to convene and hold the ANI special meeting regardless of any change in the recommendation of the ANI board of directors. Likewise, holders of shares representing approximately two percent of the outstanding capital stock of BioSante as of October 3, 2012 are subject to a voting agreement, pursuant to which the holders of such shares have agreed to vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and the issuance of the shares of BioSante common stock, and the approval of the BioSante charter amendments, and BioSante is required under the terms of the merger agreement to convene and hold the BioSante special meeting regardless of any change in the recommendation of the BioSante board of directors. These provisions might discourage an otherwise interested third party from considering or proposing an acquisition of BioSante, even one that may be deemed of greater value than the merger to BioSante stockholders. Furthermore, even if a third party elects to propose an acquisition, the concept of a termination fee or payment of the other partys expenses may result in that third party offering a lower value to BioSante stockholders than such third party might otherwise have offered. Because the lack of a public market for shares of ANI capital stock makes it difficult to evaluate the fairness of the merger, ANI stockholders may receive consideration in the merger that is greater than the fair value of the shares of capital stock of ANI. ANI is privately held and its outstanding capital stock is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine the fair value of ANI or its shares of capital stock. Since the percentage of BioSantes equity to be issued to the ANI stockholders was determined based on negotiations between the parties, it is possible that the value of the BioSante common stock to be issued in connection with the merger will be greater than the fair value of ANI. BioSante may not issue contingent value rights (CVRs) to holders of BioSante common stock prior to the merger and, even if issued, the CVRs will not be certificated or transferable and may not result in any cash payments to holders of CVRs. Although BioSante currently plans to enter into the contingent value rights agreement and issue CVRs to holders of BioSante common stock as of March 15, 2013, there is no assurance that the CVRs will be issued at all or based on the terms currently set forth in the form of the contingent value rights agreement. BioSante currently has not entered into the contingent value rights agreement and the BioSante board of directors may determine in its sole discretion not to issue the CVRs based on, among other things, the anticipated tax impact of the distribution and issuance of the CVRs to the holders of BioSante common stock. Furthermore, if BioSante and ANI agree, the terms of the contingent value rights agreement as contemplated currently may be changed prior to BioSante entering into the contingent value rights agreement. Even if CVRs are issued, they will not be certificated or transferable and may not result in any cash payments to holders of CVRs. Under the contingent value rights agreement, the combined company will not have any obligation, other than an obligation to act in good faith to pursue, engage in, negotiate, enter into or consummate an actual or potential LibiGel transaction (as such term is defined in the contingent value rights agreement). BioSante may waive one or more of the conditions to the merger without resoliciting stockholder approval for the merger. Certain conditions to BioSantes obligations to complete the merger may be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent legally allowed, either unilaterally or by agreement of BioSante and ANI. In the event of a waiver of a condition, the board of directors of BioSante will evaluate the materiality of any such waiver to determine whether amendment of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and resolicitation of proxies is necessary. In the event that the board of directors of BioSante determines any such waiver is not significant enough to require resolicitation of stockholders, it will have the discretion to complete the merger without 23 Table of Contents seeking further stockholder approval. The conditions requiring the approval of each companys stockholders cannot, however, be waived. Risks Related to the Combined Company if the Merger is Completed The success of the merger will depend, in large part, on the ability of the combined company following completion of the merger to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of BioSante and ANI. The merger involves the integration of two companies that previously have operated independently with principal offices in two distinct locations. Due to legal restrictions, BioSante and ANI are able to conduct only limited planning regarding the integration of the two companies prior to completion of the merger. Significant management attention and resources will be required to integrate the two companies after completion of the merger. The failure to integrate successfully and to manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration process may result in the combined companys failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following: · using the combined companys cash and other assets efficiently to develop the business of the combined company; · appropriately managing the liabilities of the combined company; · potential unknown or currently unquantifiable liabilities associated with the merger and the operations of the combined company; · potential unknown and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the merger; and · performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of managements attention caused by completing the merger and integrating the companies operations. Delays in the integration process could adversely affect the combined companys business, financial results, financial condition and stock price following the merger. Even if the combined company were able to integrate the business operations successfully, there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from this integration and that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time. The merger will result in changes to the BioSante board of directors and the combined company may pursue different strategies than BioSante may have pursued independently. If BioSante and ANI complete the merger, the composition of the BioSante board of directors will change in accordance with the merger agreement. Following completion of the merger, the combined companys board of directors will consist of seven members, including two of the current directors of BioSante and five of the current directors of ANI. Currently, it is anticipated that the combined company will continue to advance the product development efforts and business strategies of ANI primarily. However, because the composition of the board of directors of the combined company will consist of directors from both BioSante and ANI, the combined company may determine to pursue certain business strategies that BioSante would not have pursued independently. 24 Table of Contents Ownership of the combined companys common stock may be highly concentrated, and it may prevent the BioSante stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest that could cause the combined companys stock price to decline. Upon completion of the merger, ANIs directors and executive officers continuing with the combined company, together with their respective affiliates, are expected to beneficially own or control approximately 41 percent of the combined company. Accordingly, these directors, executive officers and their affiliates, acting individually or as a group, will have substantial influence over the outcome of a corporate action of the combined company requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the combined companys assets or any other significant corporate transaction. These stockholders also may exert influence in delaying or preventing a change in control of the combined company, even if such change in control would benefit the other stockholders of the combined company. In addition, the significant concentration of stock ownership may affect adversely the market value of the combined companys common stock due to investors perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise. Future results of the combined company may differ materially from the unaudited pro forma financial statements presented in the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the financial forecasts prepared by ANI in connection with discussions concerning the merger. The future results of the combined company may be materially different from those shown in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements presented in the joint proxy statement/prospectus, which show only a combination of the historical results of BioSante and ANI, and the financial forecasts prepared by ANI in connection with discussions concerning the merger. BioSante and ANI expect to incur significant costs associated with completion of the merger and combining the operations of the two companies. The exact magnitude of these costs is not yet known, but is estimated to be approximately $3.1 million. Furthermore, these costs may decrease the capital that the combined company could use for continued development of the combined companys business in the future or may cause the combined company to seek to raise new capital sooner than expected. The combined companys ability to utilize BioSantes or ANIs net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future is subject to substantial limitations and may be further limited as a result of the merger. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), if a corporation undergoes an ownership change (generally defined as a greater than 50 percent change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporations ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. Further, if the historic business of BioSante is not treated as being continued by the combined entity for the two-year period beginning on the date of the merger (referred to as the continuity of business requirement), the pre-transaction net operating loss carryforward deductions become substantially reduced or unavailable for use by the surviving corporation in the transaction. In 2009, an ownership change occurred with respect to BioSante, and it is expected that the merger with ANI will result in another ownership change of BioSante. Accordingly, the combined companys ability to utilize BioSantes net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be substantially limited. These limitations, in turn, could result in increased future tax payments for the combined company, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the combined company. Under Section 384 of the Code, available net operating loss carryovers of BioSante or ANI may not be available to offset certain gains arising after the merger from assets held by the other corporation at the effective time of the merger. This limitation will apply to the extent that the gain is attributable to an unrealized built-in-gain in the assets of BioSante or ANI existing at the effective time of the merger. To the extent that any such gains are recognized in the five year period after the merger upon the disposition of any 25 Table of Contents such assets, the net operating loss carryovers of the other corporation will not be available to offset such gains (but the net operating loss carryovers of the corporation that owned such assets will not be limited by Section 384 although they may be subject to other limitations under Section 382 as described above). The price of BioSante common stock after the merger is completed may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the price of BioSante common stock. The business of BioSante differs significantly from the business of ANI; and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the trading price of BioSante common stock following completion of the merger may be affected significantly by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of BioSante. The NASDAQ Global Market considers the anticipated merger of BioSante and ANI to be a business combination with a non-NASDAQ entity, resulting in a change in control of BioSante; and therefore, has required that BioSante submit a new initial listing application, which requires certain actions on the part of the combined company which may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, could make it more difficult for holders of shares of the combined company to sell their shares. The NASDAQ Global Market considers the merger between BioSante and ANI to be a business combination with a non-NASDAQ entity, resulting in a change in control of BioSante and has required that BioSante submit a new initial listing application. The NASDAQ Global Market may not approve BioSantes new initial listing application for The NASDAQ Global Market on a timely basis, or at all. If this occurs and the merger is still completed, stockholders may have difficulty converting their investments into cash effectively. Additionally, as part of the new initial listing application, BioSante will be required to submit, among other things, a plan for the combined company to effect a reverse stock split. A reverse stock split likely would increase the per share trading price by an as yet undetermined multiple. The change in share price may affect the volatility and liquidity of the combined companys stock, as well as the marketplaces perception of the stock. As a result, the relative price of the combined companys stock may decline and/or fluctuate more than in the past, and stockholders may have trouble converting their investments in the combined company into cash effectively. The combined companys management will be required to devote substantial time to comply with public company regulations. As a public company, the combined company will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that ANI did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as well as rules implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Global Market, impose various requirements on public companies, including those related to corporate governance practices. The combined companys management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these requirements. Certain members of ANIs management, which will continue as the management of the combined company, do not have significant experience in addressing these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase the combined companys legal and financial compliance costs relative to those of ANI and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that the combined company maintain effective internal control for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, the combined company must perform system and process evaluation and testing of its internal control over financial reporting to allow management and the combined companys independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The combined companys compliance with these requirements will require that it incur substantial accounting and related expenses and expend significant management efforts. The combined company will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff to satisfy the ongoing requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The costs of hiring such staff may be material and there can be no 26 Table of Contents assurance that such staff will be immediately available to the combined company. Moreover, if the combined company is not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if the combined company or its independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the combined companys financial reports, the market price of the combined companys common stock could decline and the combined company could be subject to sanctions or investigations by The NASDAQ Global Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. After completion of the merger, the combined company will possess not only all of the assets but also all of the liabilities of both BioSante and ANI. Discovery of previously undisclosed or unknown liabilities could have an adverse effect on the combined companys business, operating results and financial condition. Acquisitions involve risks, including inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems. After completion of the merger, the combined company will possess not only all of the assets, but also all of the liabilities of both BioSante and ANI. Although BioSante conducted a due diligence investigation of ANI and its known and potential liabilities and obligations, and ANI conducted a due diligence investigation of BioSante and its known and potential liabilities and obligations, it is possible that undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems may arise after completion of the merger, which could have an adverse effect on the combined companys business, operating results and financial condition. BioSante and ANI do not expect the combined company to pay cash dividends. BioSante and ANI anticipate that the combined company will retain its earnings, if any, for future growth and therefore not pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in the combined companys common stock for that purpose. Anti-takeover provisions in the combined companys charter and bylaws may prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to change the board of directors or management and could make a third-party acquisition of the combined company difficult. The combined companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended, will contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the combined companys common stock. The sale or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock of the combined company after the merger and after expiration of the lock-up period could adversely affect the market price of such shares after the merger. Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock of the combined company in the public market after the merger or after expiration of the lock-up period that will apply to certain of ANIs stockholders and executive officers, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of such shares and could materially impair the combined companys ability to raise capital through equity offerings in the future. BioSante is unable to predict what effect, if any, market sales of securities held by significant stockholders, directors or officers of the combined company or the availability of these securities for future sale will have on the market price of the combined companys common stock after the merger. 27 Table of Contents Risks Related to BioSante Risks Related to BioSantes Financial Condition and Future Capital Requirements BioSante has not generated significant revenues and does not expect to in the near future. BioSante has a history of operating losses, expects continuing losses and may never become profitable. Substantially all of BioSantes revenue to date has been derived from upfront and milestone payments earned on licensing transactions, revenue earned from subcontracts and royalty revenue. In order to generate new and significant revenues, BioSante must develop and commercialize successfully its own products or enter into strategic partnering agreements with others who can develop and commercialize them successfully, or acquire additional new products that generate or have the potential to generate revenues. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with BioSantes and its strategic partners product development programs and BioSantes ability to acquire additional new products, BioSante is unable to predict when it will be able to generate significant revenue or become profitable, if at all. BioSante incurred a net loss of $27.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, BioSantes accumulated deficit was $245.0 million. BioSante expects to continue to incur substantial and continuing losses for the foreseeable future. These losses will increase if BioSante decides to pursue the two new LibiGel Phase III efficacy trials or in-license additional new products that require further development. Even if BioSantes approved products, products in development or any additional new products BioSante may acquire or in-license are introduced commercially, BioSante may never achieve market acceptance and it may never generate sufficient revenues or receive sufficient license fees or royalties on its licensed products and technologies in order to achieve or sustain future profitability. Because BioSante has no source of significant recurring revenue, BioSante must depend on financing or partnering to sustain its operations. BioSante likely will need to raise substantial additional capital or enter into strategic partnering agreements to fund its operations and BioSante may be unable to raise such funds or enter into strategic partnering agreements when needed and on acceptable terms. Developing products requires substantial amounts of capital. BioSante estimates that the cost of the two new LibiGel Phase III efficacy trials will be approximately $15 to $18 million each, or a combined $30 to $36 million spread over 18 months. No assurance can be provided, however, that BioSantes cost estimates will be correct. It is possible that the two new LibiGel Phase III efficacy trials will cost more than BioSante anticipates. If BioSante decides to pursue the two new LibiGel Phase III efficacy trials or in-license additional new products that require further development, BioSante will need to raise substantial additional capital or enter into strategic partnering agreements to fund its operations and it may be unable to raise such funds or enter into strategic partnering agreements when needed and on acceptable terms. BioSantes future capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including: · the progress, timing, cost and results of its clinical development programs, including the two new LibiGel Phase III efficacy trials if BioSante decides to pursue them and if BioSante in-licenses additional new products that require further development; · the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory actions with respect to BioSantes products; · the success, progress, timing and costs of BioSantes business development efforts to implement business collaborations, licenses and other business combinations or transactions, and its efforts to evaluate various strategic alternatives available with respect to its products and its company. · BioSantes ability to obtain value from its current products and technologies and its ability to out-license its products and technologies to third parties for development and commercialization and the terms of such out-licenses; 28 Table of Contents · BioSantes ability to acquire or in-license additional new products and technologies and the costs and expenses of such acquisitions or licenses; · the timing and amount of any royalties, milestone or other payments BioSante may receive from or be obligated to pay to current and potential licensors, licensees and other third parties; · the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; · the emergence of competing products and technologies, and other adverse market developments; · the perceived, potential and actual commercial success of BioSantes products; · the outstanding principal amount of BioSantes 3.125% convertible senior notes due May 1, 2013 (convertible senior notes) that are scheduled to mature and become due and payable on May 1, 2013 and BioSantes ability to avoid a fundamental change or an event of default under the indenture governing such notes, which may cause such notes to become due and payable prior to their maturity date on May 1, 2013; · BioSantes operating expenses; and · the resolution of BioSantes pending purported class action and shareholder derivative litigation and any amount it may be required to pay in excess of its directors and officers liability insurance. BioSantes future capital requirements and projected expenditures are based upon numerous assumptions and subject to many uncertainties, and actual requirements and expenditures may differ significantly from its projections. To date, BioSante has relied primarily upon proceeds from sales of its equity securities to finance its business and operations. BioSante likely will need to raise additional capital to fund its operations. As of December 31, 2012, BioSante had $34.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. BioSante does not have any existing credit facilities under which it may borrow funds. Absent the receipt of any additional licensing income or financing, BioSante expects its cash and cash equivalents balance to decrease as it continues to use cash to fund its operations, including in particular the two new LibiGel Phase III efficacy trials if BioSante decides to pursue them. As of December 31, 2012, BioSante has $8.3 million in principal amount of convertible senior notes outstanding that mature on May 1, 2013. Assuming the merger is completed during the first quarter of 2013 and BioSante decides not to commence the two new efficacy trials for LibiGel, BioSante expects its cash equivalents as of December 31, 2012 to meet its liquidity requirements through at least its anticipated closing of the merger, including the closing condition under the merger agreement to have at least $17.0 million of net cash, as defined in the merger agreement, available upon the closing of the merger. If the merger is not completed, BioSante will need to reevaluate its strategic alternatives, which may include continuing to operate its business as an independent, stand-alone company, a sale of the company, liquidation of the company or other strategic transaction. BioSantes liquidity position will be dependent upon the strategic alternative selected; however, assuming BioSante does not enter into another strategic transaction, and assuming BioSante decides not to commence the two new efficacy trials for LibiGel, BioSante expects its cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2012 will be sufficient to meet its liquidity requirements for at least the next three to five years. Additional financing would be required should BioSante decide to commence the two new efficacy trials for LibiGel. These estimates may prove incorrect or BioSante, nonetheless, may choose to raise additional financing earlier in order to create a cash cushion and take advantage of favorable financing conditions. The December 2011 announcement of the results of BioSantes prior completed LibiGel Phase III efficacy trials has significantly depressed the trading price of BioSante common stock and harmed BioSantes ability to raise additional capital. BioSante can provide no assurance that additional financing, if needed, will 29 Table of Contents be available on terms favorable to BioSante, or at all. This is particularly true if investors are not confident in BioSantes LibiGel Phase III development program, the future value of the company and/or if economic and market conditions deteriorate. BioSante has on file effective shelf registration statements that allow it to raise up to an aggregate of $102.4 million from the sale of common stock, preferred stock, warrants or units comprised of the foregoing. However, under applicable SEC rules, if BioSante has a public float of less than $75.0 million, it can only offer to sell under the registration statement up to one-third of its public float during any 12-month period. BioSante can provide no assurance that additional financing, if needed, will be available on terms favorable to it, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms when BioSante needs them, BioSante may need to make changes to its operations to reduce costs. As an alternative to raising additional financing, BioSante may choose to license LibiGel, Elestrin (outside the territories already licensed) or another product, to a third party who may finance a portion or all of the continued development and, if approved, commercialization of that licensed product, sell certain assets or rights BioSante has under its existing license agreements or decide or be forced to explore other strategic alternatives, such as selling or merging the company or winding down its operations and liquidating the company. In such case, the BioSante stockholders could lose some or all of their investment. Raising additional funds by issuing additional equity securities may cause dilution to existing BioSante stockholders, raising additional funds by issuing additional debt financing may restrict BioSantes operations and raising additional funds through licensing arrangements may require BioSante to relinquish proprietary rights. If BioSante raises additional funds through the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of its stockholders could be diluted significantly, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of its existing stockholders. In addition, the issuance of any equity securities could be at a discount to the market price. If BioSante incurs additional debt financing, the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness may limit funds available for its business activities, and BioSante could be subject to covenants that restrict its ability to operate its business and make distributions to its stockholders. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of BioSantes assets, as well as prohibitions on the ability of BioSante to create liens, pay dividends, redeem its stock or make investments. There is no assurance that any equity or debt financing transaction will be available on terms acceptable to BioSante, or at all. As an alternative to raising additional financing by issuing additional equity or debt securities, BioSante may choose to license one or more of its products or technologies to a third party who may finance a portion or all of the continued development and, if approved, commercialization of that licensed product, sell certain assets or rights under BioSantes existing license agreements or enter into other business collaborations or combinations, including a possible sale or merger of its company. If BioSante raises additional funds through licensing arrangements, BioSante may be required to relinquish greater or all rights to BioSantes products at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than BioSante otherwise would choose. BioSante has substantial indebtedness, in the form of convertible senior notes, which notes BioSante may not be able to pay when they become due and payable on May 1, 2013, or earlier if BioSante experiences a fundamental change or an event of default under the indenture governing such notes. As of December 31, 2012, BioSante had $8.3 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes outstanding. The annual interest payment on these notes is approximately $259,000. At maturity, on May 1, 2013, the entire then remaining aggregate outstanding principal amount of the convertible senior notes will become due and payable. In addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of the convertible senior notes may require BioSante to purchase their notes prior to the May 1, 2013 maturity date. A fundamental change includes a significant change in BioSantes ownership; the first day the majority of its board of directors does not consist of continuing directors; the consummation of certain recapitalizations, 30 Table of Contents reclassifications, or changes of common stock, share exchanges or consolidations or mergers; or the termination of trading of BioSante common stock (which will be deemed to have occurred if BioSante common stock is neither listed for trading on a United States national securities exchange nor any United States system of automated dissemination of quotations of securities prices or traded in over-the-counter securities markets). The proposed merger between BioSante and ANI will not amount to a fundamental change under the indenture. Additionally, the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding convertible senior notes will become due and payable upon an uncured or unwaived event of default. Although BioSante believes it will be able to pay the aggregate outstanding principal amount of its convertible senior notes plus accrued interest when the notes mature on May 1, 2013, it is possible that BioSante may not have sufficient funds to pay the aggregate principal amount of its then outstanding convertible senior notes when they mature on May 1, 2013, or become due and payable earlier if BioSante were to experience a fundamental change or an event of default under the indenture governing such notes. The indentures governing BioSantes convertible senior notes contains covenants, which if not complied with, could result in an event of default and the acceleration of all amounts due under the notes. The indenture governing BioSantes convertible senior notes contains covenants, such as the requirement to pay accrued interest on May 1 and November 1 of each year, the requirement to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture, if a note holder so elects and the requirement to file periodic reports electronically with the SEC. If BioSante does not comply with the covenants in the indenture, an event of default could occur and all amounts due under the notes could become immediately due and payable. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture, the trustee has available a range of remedies customary in these circumstances, including declaring all such indebtedness, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to be due and payable. Although it is possible BioSante could negotiate a waiver with the trustee and the holders of the notes, such a waiver likely would involve significant costs. It also is possible that BioSante could refinance or restructure its obligations under the notes; however, such a refinancing or restructuring also likely would involve significant costs and likely would result in higher interest rates than the current 3.125% annual interest rate on the notes. Future purchases, exchanges or restructurings of BioSantes outstanding convertible senior notes could dilute the percentage ownership of the BioSante stockholders, result in the issuance of securities at a discount to market price or that may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of BioSantes existing stockholders and/or decrease its cash balance. In February 2012, BioSante entered into privately-negotiated securities exchange agreements with one of the holders of its convertible senior notes pursuant to which BioSante issued an aggregate of 1,868,055 shares of its common stock, as adjusted to reflect its one-for-six reverse stock split effected on June 1, 2012, to the note holder in exchange for the cancellation of an aggregate of $9.0 million principal amount of BioSantes convertible senior notes, including accrued and unpaid interest of $79,024. In July 2012, BioSante entered into a privately-negotiated securities exchange agreement with two of the holders of its convertible senior notes pursuant to which BioSante issued an aggregate of 1,784,070 shares of its common stock to the note holder in exchange for the cancellation of an aggregate of $3.5 million principal amount of BioSantes convertible senior notes and accrued and unpaid interest of $20,686. An aggregate of $8.3 million principal amount of the convertible senior notes remained outstanding as of September 30, 2012. From time-to-time, BioSante again may purchase, exchange or restructure its outstanding convertible senior notes through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other equity securities of its company, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions and/or a tender offer. Such additional purchases, exchanges or restructurings, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the trading price and volume of BioSante common stock, the willingness of the note holders to sell, exchange or restructure their notes, BioSantes available cash and cash equivalents, its liquidity requirements, regulatory limitations, contractual restrictions and other factors. Such future purchases, exchanges or restructurings could dilute the percentage ownership of the BioSante stockholders, result in the issuance of securities at a discount to market price or that may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing BioSante stockholders and/or decrease BioSantes cash balance. A significant decrease in 31 Table of Contents BioSantes cash balance may impair its ability to execute strategic alternatives, including the proposed merger with ANI, or leave BioSante without sufficient cash remaining for operations. BioSante is subject to pending purported securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation, which could divert managements attention, harm its business and/or reputation and result in significant liabilities, as well as harm its ability to raise additional financing and execute certain strategic alternatives. BioSante is subject to pending purported securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation. On February 3, 2012, a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the caption Thomas Lauria, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated v. BioSante Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Stephen M. Simes naming BioSante and its President and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen M. Simes, as defendants. The complaint alleges that certain of BioSantes disclosures relating to the efficacy of LibiGel and its commercial potential were false and/or misleading and that such false and/or misleading statements had the effect of artificially inflating the price of BioSantes securities resulting in violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Rule 10b-5 and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Although a substantially similar complaint was filed in the same court on February 21, 2012, such complaint was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff in April 2012. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of persons who purchased BioSantes securities between February 12, 2010 and December 15, 2011, and seeks unspecified compensatory damages, equitable and/or injunctive relief, and reasonable costs, expert fees and attorneys fees on behalf of such purchasers. BioSante believes the action is without merit and intends to defend the action vigorously. On November 6, 2012, the plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint. On December 28, 2012, BioSante and Mr. Simes filed motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. Briefing on the motion to dismiss is ongoing and is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2013. On May 7, 2012, Jerome W. Weinstein, a purported stockholder of BioSante filed a shareholder derivative action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the caption Weinstein v. BioSante Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al., naming BioSantes directors as defendants and BioSante as a nominal defendant. A substantially similar complaint was filed in the same court on May 22, 2012 and another substantially similar complaint was filed in the Circuit Court for Cook County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division, on June 27, 2012. The suits generally related to the same events that are the subject of the class action litigation described above. The complaints allege breaches of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and unjust enrichment as causes of action occurring from at least February 2010 through December 2011. The complaints seek unspecified damages, punitive damages, costs and disbursements and unspecified reform and improvements in BioSantes corporate governance and internal control procedures. On September 24, 2012, the District Court consolidated the two cases before it and on November 20, 2012 plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint. On November 27, 2012, the plaintiff in the action pending in Illinois state court filed an amended complaint. On January 11, 2013, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in the action pending in District Court, and on January 18, 2013, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in the action pending in Illinois state court. Briefing on these motions is ongoing and is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2013. The lawsuits are in their early stages; and, therefore, BioSante is unable to predict the outcome of the lawsuits and the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with their resolution or any potential effect the lawsuits may have on BioSantes operations. Depending on the outcome or resolution of these lawsuits, they could have a material effect on BioSantes operations, including its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. BioSante is not involved in any other legal actions, however, from time to time may be subject to various pending or threatened legal actions and proceedings, including those that arise in the ordinary course of 32 Table of Contents its business. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and to outcomes that are not predictable with assurance and that may not be known for extended periods of time. Risks Related to BioSantes Business BioSantes two pivotal LibiGel Phase III efficacy trials did not meet the co-primary and secondary endpoints, and it is possible that the two new LibiGel Phase III efficacy trials, if BioSante decides to pursue them, will not meet the co-primary and secondary endpoints, which could harm BioSantes business and further disappoint BioSante stockholders and cause the trading price of BioSante common stock to decrease. BioSantes lead near term product in development is LibiGel for the treatment of FSD, specifically HSDD, in postmenopausal women, for which there is no FDA-approved product. In June 2012, BioSante announced a plan to initiate two new LibiGel Phase III efficacy trials. This decision was based on an extensive analysis of previous efficacy data, consultation with key opinion leaders in FSD, testosterone therapy and placebo effects, as well as a meeting with the FDA. The protocol for the two new efficacy trials is in development. BioSante intends to apply for an FDA Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement prior to initiating the two new efficacy trials. Currently, it is expected that the efficacy trials will include the same FDA-required efficacy endpoints as prior Phase III efficacy trials: an increase in the number of satisfying sexual events and sexual desire, and decreased distress associated with low desire. The initiation of the two new LibiGel Phase III efficacy trials involves risk, especially since BioSantes prior LibiGel Phase III efficacy trials failed to meet the co-primary or secondary endpoints. Although the results indicated that LibiGel performed as predicted based on previous experience with testosterone products for female sexual dysfunction, the placebo response in the two efficacy trials was greater than expected; and therefore, LibiGels results were not shown to be statistically different from placebo. No assurance can be provided that BioSante will be able to design the two new LibiGel Phase III efficacy trials to minimize sufficiently the placebo effect and meet the co-primary and secondary endpoints for the trials. In addition, BioSante can provide no assurance that it will be able to obtain an FDA SPA agreement for such trials or that BioSante will initiate or complete the trials on a timely basis, or ever. Any of these possible results could harm BioSantes business and further disappoint BioSante stockholders and cause the trading price of BioSante common stock to decrease. Although BioSantes male testosterone gel is approved by the FDA, BioSante is uncertain as to when Teva will begin to market and sell the male testosterone gel and thus when or if BioSante would begin to receive royalties from such sales in light of Tevas settlement agreement with AbbVie Inc. BioSantes male testosterone gel was developed initially by BioSante, and then licensed by BioSante to Teva for late stage clinical development. Teva submitted a New Drug Application, which NDA was approved by the FDA in February 2012. Subsequent to Teva submitting the NDA, in April 2011, AbbVie Inc., a marketer of a testosterone gel for men, filed a complaint against Teva alleging patent infringement. The Teva/AbbVie patent infringement litigation was settled in December 2011; however, the terms of the settlement agreement are confidential and have not been publicly disclosed. In light of the settlement agreement, BioSante is uncertain as to when or if Teva will begin to market and sell its male testosterone gel and thus when or if BioSante would begin to receive royalties from such sales. 33 Table of Contents Several of BioSantes products are in the clinical development stages and, depending on the product, likely will not be approved by regulatory authorities or introduced commercially for at least several years and likely more, if at all. Several of BioSantes products are in the clinical development stages and will require further development, preclinical and clinical testing and investment prior to obtaining required regulatory approvals and commercialization in the United States and abroad. Other than Elestrin and BioSantes male testosterone gel, none of BioSantes products have been approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; and accordingly, none of BioSantes products have been introduced commercially and most are not expected to be for several years and likely more, if at all. BioSante cannot assure you that any of its products in clinical development will: · be developed successfully; · prove to be safe and effective in clinical studies; · meet applicable regulatory standards or obtain required regulatory approvals; · demonstrate substantial protective or therapeutic benefits in the prevention or treatment of any disease; · be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable costs; · obtain coverage and favorable reimbursement rates from insurers and other third-party payors; or · be marketed successfully or achieve market acceptance by physicians and patients. If BioSante fails to obtain regulatory approval to manufacture commercially or sell any of its future products, or if approval is delayed or withdrawn, BioSante will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of its products. BioSante must obtain regulatory approval to sell any of its products in the United States and abroad. In the United States, BioSante must obtain the approval of the FDA for each product or drug that BioSante intends to commercialize. The FDA approval process typically is very lengthy and expensive, and approval never is certain. Products to be commercialized abroad are subject to similar foreign government regulation. Generally, only a very small percentage of newly discovered pharmaceutical products that enter preclinical development eventually are approved for sale. Because of the risks and uncertainties in biopharmaceutical development, BioSantes products could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than BioSante expects or may never gain approval. If regulatory approval is delayed or never obtained, the credibility of BioSantes management, the value of BioSante and its operating results and liquidity would be affected adversely. Even if a product gains regulatory approval, the product and the manufacturer of the product may be subject to continuing regulatory review and BioSante may be restricted or prohibited from marketing or manufacturing a product if previously unknown problems with the product or its manufacture of the product subsequently are discovered. The FDA also may require BioSante to commit to perform lengthy post-approval studies, for which BioSante would have to expend significant additional resources, which could have an adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition. To obtain regulatory approval to market many of BioSantes products, costly and lengthy human clinical trials are required, and the results of the studies and trials are highly uncertain. As part of the FDA approval process, BioSante must conduct, at its own expense or the expense of current or potential licensees or other entities, clinical trials in human subjects on each of BioSantes products. BioSante expects the number of human clinical trials that the FDA will require will vary depending on the product, the disease or condition 34 Table of Contents the product is being developed to address and regulations applicable to the particular product. Depending on the stage of development, BioSante may need to perform multiple pre-clinical studies using various doses and formulations before BioSante can begin human clinical trials, which could result in delays in BioSantes ability to market its products. Furthermore, even if BioSante obtains favorable results in pre-clinical studies on animals, the results in humans may be different. In order to receive regulatory approval for commercial sale, BioSante must demonstrate that its products are safe and effective for use in the target human population. The data obtained from pre-clinical and human clinical testing are subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. BioSante faces the risk that the results of its clinical trials in later phases of clinical trials may be inconsistent with those obtained in earlier phases. As an example, BioSantes prior two pivotal LibiGel Phase III efficacy trials did not meet the co-primary endpoints of an increase in satisfying sexual events and an increase in desire and the secondary endpoint of a decrease in distress compared to placebo even though treatment with LibiGel in BioSantes Phase II clinical trial significantly increased satisfying sexual events compared to placebo. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after experiencing promising results in early animal or human testing. Adverse or inconclusive human clinical results would prevent BioSante from submitting for regulatory approval of its products. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of BioSantes human clinical trials include: · slow subject enrollment; · timely completion of clinical site protocol approval and obtaining informed consent from subjects; · longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy or safety; · new or additional trials or studies that are designed differently in order to increase the chances of demonstrating efficacy or safety; · adverse medical events or side effects in treated subjects; · lack of effectiveness of the product being tested; and · lack of funding. Delays in BioSantes clinical trials could allow its competitors additional time to develop or market competing products and thus can be extremely costly in terms of lost sales opportunities and increased clinical trial costs. The process for obtaining FDA approval of an NDA is time consuming, subject to unanticipated delays and costs, and requires the commitment of substantial resources. BioSantes products in development will require the submission and approval of an NDA in order to obtain required approval by the FDA to commercially market the product. The FDA conducts in-depth reviews of NDAs to determine whether to approve products for commercial marketing for the indications proposed. If the FDA is not satisfied with the information provided, the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or may require a company to perform additional studies or provide other information in order to secure approval. The FDA may delay, limit or refuse to approve an NDA for many reasons, including: · the information submitted may be insufficient to demonstrate that a product is safe and effective; 35 Table of Contents · the FDA might not approve the processes or facilities of a company, or those of its vendors, that will be used for the commercial manufacture of a product; or · the FDAs interpretation of the nonclinical, clinical or manufacturing data provided in an NDA may differ from a companys interpretation of such data. If the FDA determines that the clinical studies submitted for a product candidate in support of an NDA are not conducted in full compliance with the applicable protocols for these studies, as well as with applicable regulations and standards, or if the FDA does not agree with a companys interpretation of the results of such studies, the FDA may reject the data that resulted from such studies. The rejection of data from clinical studies required to support an NDA could affect negatively a companys ability to obtain marketing authorization for a product and would have a material adverse effect on a companys business and financial condition. In addition, an NDA may not be approved, or approval may be delayed, as a result of changes in FDA policies for drug approval during development or the review period. BioSante may not achieve projected goals and objectives in the time periods that BioSante anticipates or announce publicly, which could have an adverse effect on its business and could cause the price of BioSante common stock to decline. BioSante sets goals and objectives for, and makes public statements regarding, the timing of certain accomplishments and milestones regarding its business, such as the initiation and completion of clinical studies, the completion of enrollment for clinical studies, the submission of applications for regulatory approvals, the receipt of regulatory approvals and other developments and milestones. The actual timing of these events can vary dramatically due to a number of factors including without limitation delays or failures in BioSantes current clinical studies, the amount of time, effort and resources committed to its programs by BioSante and its current and potential future strategic partners and the uncertainties inherent in the clinical studies and regulatory approval process. As a result, there can be no assurance that clinical studies involving BioSantes products in development will advance or be completed in the time periods that BioSante or its strategic partners announce or expect, that BioSante or its current and potential future strategic partners will make regulatory submissions or receive regulatory approvals as planned or that BioSante or its current and potential future strategic partners will be able to adhere to its current schedule for the achievement of key milestones under any of its development programs. If BioSante or any of its strategic partners fail to achieve one or more of these milestones as planned, BioSantes business could be affected adversely and materially and the trading price of BioSante common stock could decline. BioSante also discloses from time-to-time projected financial information, including its cash position and anticipated cash burn rate and other expenditures, for future periods. These financial projections are based on managements current expectations and may not contain any margin of error or cushion for any specific uncertainties, or for the uncertainties inherent in all financial forecasting. If the market opportunities for BioSantes products are smaller than BioSante anticipates, then its future revenues and business may be affected adversely. From time-to-time, BioSante discloses estimated market opportunity data for its products and products in development. Although BioSante believes it has a reasonable basis for its market opportunity estimates, BioSante estimates may prove to be incorrect. If the market opportunities for BioSantes products are smaller than BioSante anticipates, its anticipated revenues from the sales or licensure of such products will be lower than BioSante anticipates. 36 Table of Contents Uncertainties associated with the impact of published studies regarding the adverse health effects of certain forms of hormone therapy could adversely affect the market for BioSantes hormone therapy products and the trading price of BioSante common stock. The market for hormone therapy products has been affected negatively by the Womens Health Initiative (WHI) study and other studies that have found that the overall health risks from the use of certain hormone therapy products may exceed the benefits from the use of those products among postmenopausal women. In July 2002, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) released data from its WHI study on the risks and benefits associated with long-term use of oral hormone therapy by women. The NIH announced that it was discontinuing the arm of the study investigating the use of oral estrogen/progestin combination hormone therapy products after an average follow-up period of 5.2 years because the product used in the study was shown to cause an increase in the risk of invasive breast cancer. The study also found an increased risk of stroke, heart attacks and blood clots and concluded that overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin for an average of 5.2 year follow-up among postmenopausal women. Also, in July 2002, results of an observational study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute on the effects of estrogen therapy were announced. The main finding of the study was that postmenopausal women who used estrogen therapy for 10 or more years had a higher risk of developing ovarian cancer than women who never used hormone therapy. In October 2002, a significant hormone therapy study being conducted in the United Kingdom also was halted. BioSantes products differ from the products used in the WHI study and the primary products observed in the National Cancer Institute and United Kingdom studies. In March 2004, the NIH announced that the estrogen-alone study was discontinued after nearly seven years because the NIH concluded that estrogen alone does not affect (either increase or decrease) heart disease, the major question being evaluated in the study. The findings indicated a slightly increased risk of stroke as well as a decreased risk of hip fracture and breast cancer. Preliminary data from the memory portion of the WHI study suggested that estrogen alone may possibly be associated with a slight increase in the risk of dementia or mild cognitive impairment. Researchers continue to analyze data from both arms of the WHI study and other studies. Some reports indicate that the safety of estrogen products may be affected by the age of the woman at initiation of therapy. There currently are no studies published comparing the safety of BioSantes products against other hormone therapies. The markets for female hormone therapies for menopausal symptoms declined as a result of these published studies, although the market now seems to have stabilized. The release of any follow-up or other studies that show adverse effects from hormone therapy, including in particular, hormone therapies similar to BioSantes products, also could adversely affect BioSantes business and decrease the trading price of BioSante common stock. If clinical studies for BioSantes products are terminated, prolonged or delayed, it may be difficult for BioSante to find a strategic partner to assist it in the development and commercialization of its non-partnered products or commercialize such products on a timely basis, which would require BioSante to incur additional costs and delay or prevent its receipt of any revenue from potential product sales or licenses. BioSante may encounter problems with its completed, ongoing or planned clinical studies for its products that may cause it or the FDA to delay, suspend or terminate those studies or delay the analysis of data derived from them. A number of events, including any of the following, could delay the completion of, or cause BioSante to suspend or terminate its ongoing and planned clinical studies for its products and negatively impact BioSantes ability to obtain regulatory approval or enter into strategic partnerships for, or market or sell, a particular product: · conditions imposed on BioSante by the FDA or any foreign regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of its clinical studies; 37 Table of Contents · delay in developing, or BioSantes inability to obtain, a clinical dosage form, insufficient supply or deficient quality of its products or other materials necessary to conduct its clinical studies; · negative or inconclusive results from clinical studies, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results, that necessitate additional clinical study or termination of a clinical program; · serious and/or unexpected product-related side effects experienced by subjects in BioSantes clinical studies; or · failure of BioSantes third-party contractors or its investigators to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations to BioSante in a timely manner. Regulatory authorities, clinical investigators, institutional review boards, data safety monitoring boards and the sites at which BioSantes clinical studies are conducted all have the power to stop or recommend stopping its clinical studies prior to completion. BioSantes clinical studies for its products in development may not begin as planned, may need to be amended, suspended or terminated and may not be completed on schedule, if at all. This is particularly true if BioSante no longer believes it can obtain regulatory approval for a particular product or if BioSante no longer has the financial resources to dedicate to a clinical development program for a particular product. BioSante relies on third parties to assist it in certain aspects of its clinical studies. If these third parties do not perform as required contractually or expected, BioSantes clinical studies may be extended, delayed or terminated or may need to be repeated, and BioSante may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize the product being tested in such studies. BioSante relies on third parties, such as medical institutions, academic institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to assist it in certain aspect of its clinical studies. BioSante is responsible for confirming that BioSantes studies are conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and that each of its clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol. The FDA requires BioSante to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials, to assure that data and reported results are accurate and that the clinical trial participants are adequately protected. BioSantes reliance on these few third parties does not relieve it of these responsibilities. If the third parties assisting BioSante with certain aspects of its clinical studies do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, do not meet expected deadlines, fail to comply with the FDAs good clinical practice regulations, do not adhere to BioSantes protocols or otherwise fail to generate reliable clinical data, BioSante may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and its clinical studies may be extended, delayed or terminated or may need to be repeated, and BioSante may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize the product being tested in such studies. In addition, if a third party fails to perform as agreed, BioSantes ability to collect damages may be limited contractually. BioSantes products will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even if BioSante receives marketing approval. If BioSante fails to comply with continuing regulations, BioSante could lose these approvals, and the sale of any future products could be suspended. Even if BioSante receives regulatory approval to market a particular product in development, the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority could condition approval on conducting additional costly post-approval studies or could limit the scope of BioSantes approved labeling or could impose burdensome post-approval obligations under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). If required, a REMS may include various elements, such as publication of a medication guide, a patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drugs risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. Moreover, the product may later cause adverse effects that limit or prevent its widespread use, result in more restrictive labeling than originally 38 Table of Contents approved, force BioSante to withdraw it from the market, cause the FDA to impose additional REMS obligations or impede or delay BioSantes ability to obtain regulatory approvals in additional countries. In addition, BioSante will continue to be subject to FDA review and periodic inspections to ensure adherence to applicable regulations. After receiving marketing approval, the FDA imposes extensive regulatory requirements on the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record keeping related to the product. If BioSante fails to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities or previously unknown problems with any future products, suppliers or manufacturing processes are discovered, BioSante could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including: · restrictions on the products, suppliers or manufacturing processes; · warning letters or untitled letters; · civil or criminal penalties or fines; · injunctions; · product seizures, detentions or import bans; · voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements; · suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals; · total or partial suspension of production; and · refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications. BioSante may enter into additional strategic relationships with third parties to help develop and commercialize its products in development. If BioSante does not enter into such relationships, BioSante will need to undertake development and commercialization efforts on its own, which would be costly and could delay BioSantes ability to obtain required approvals for and commercialize its future products. A key element of BioSantes business strategy is BioSantes intent to partner selectively with pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies to obtain assistance for commercialization and, in some cases, development of its products. For example, BioSante has a strategic relationship with Meda with respect to Elestrin, with Teva with respect to BioSantes male testosterone gel and with Pantarhei Science with respect to The Pill Plus. BioSante currently does not have a strategic partner for LibiGel. BioSante may enter into additional strategic relationships with third parties to develop, and if regulatory approval is obtained commercialize, its products in development, including LibiGel, and any additional new products BioSante may acquire or in-license. BioSante faces significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, and these strategic relationships can be intricate and time consuming to negotiate and document. BioSante may not be able to negotiate additional strategic relationships on acceptable terms, or at all. BioSante is unable to predict when, if ever, it will enter into any additional strategic relationships because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing such relationships. If BioSante is unable to negotiate additional strategic relationships for its products, BioSante may be forced to curtail the development of a particular product, reduce, delay or terminate its development program or one or more of its other development programs, delay its potential commercialization, reduce the scope of anticipated sales or marketing activities or undertake development or commercialization activities at BioSantes own expense. In 39 Table of Contents addition, BioSante would then bear all the risk related to the development and commercialization of that product. If BioSante elects to increase its expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on its own, BioSante may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to BioSante on acceptable terms, or at all. If BioSante does not have sufficient funds, BioSante will not be able to bring its products in development and any additional new products BioSante may acquire or in-license if they receive regulatory approvals to market and generate product revenue. If BioSante is unable to partner with a third party and obtain assistance for the potential commercialization of its products, if approved for commercial sale, BioSante would need to establish its own sales and marketing capabilities, which involves risk. BioSante does not have an internal sales and marketing organization and has limited experience in the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. There are risks involved with establishing BioSantes own sales capabilities and increasing its marketing capabilities, as well as entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. Developing an internal sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. On the other hand, if BioSante enters into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, revenues from sales of the product or the profitability of these product revenues are likely to be lower than if BioSante markets and sells any products that BioSante develops itself. Although BioSantes preferred alternative would be to engage a pharmaceutical or other healthcare company with an existing sales and marketing organization and distribution systems to sell, market and distribute its products, if approved for commercial sale, if BioSante is unable to engage such a sales and marketing partner, BioSante may need to establish its own specialty sales force. Factors that may inhibit BioSantes efforts to commercialize any future products without strategic partners or licensees include: · BioSantes inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel; · the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products; · the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put BioSante at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and · unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization. Because the establishment of sales and marketing capabilities depends on the progress towards commercialization of BioSantes products and because of the numerous risks and uncertainties involved with establishing its own sales and marketing capabilities, BioSante is unable to predict when, if ever, BioSante will establish its own sales and marketing capabilities. If BioSante is not able to partner with additional third parties and are unsuccessful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, BioSante will have difficulty commercializing its products, which would harm its business and financial condition. BioSantes current strategic relationships and any future additional strategic relationships it may enter into involve risks with respect to the development and commercialization of its products. A key element of BioSantes business strategy is to selectively partner with pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies to obtain assistance for commercialization and, in some cases, development of BioSantes products. For example, BioSante has strategic relationships with Meda with 40 Table of Contents respect to Elestrin, with Teva with respect to its male testosterone gel and with Pantarhei Science with respect to The Pill Plus. BioSantes current strategic relationships and any future additional strategic relationships BioSante may enter into involve a number of risks, including: · business combinations or significant changes in a strategic partners business strategy may affect adversely a strategic partners willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement; · BioSante may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that its strategic partners devote to the development or commercialization of its partnered products; · strategic partners may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding, terminate a clinical trial or abandon a partnered product, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new version of a product for clinical testing; · strategic partners may not pursue further development and commercialization of partnered products resulting from the strategic partnering arrangement or may elect to delay research and development programs or commercialization of a partnered product; · strategic partners may not commit adequate resources to the marketing and distribution of BioSantes partnered products, limiting BioSantes potential revenues from these products; · disputes may arise between BioSante and its strategic partners that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of its partnered products or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts managements attention and consumes resources; · strategic partners may experience financial difficulties; · strategic partners may not maintain properly or defend BioSantes intellectual property rights or may use its proprietary information in a manner that could jeopardize or invalidate its proprietary information or expose BioSante to potential litigation; · strategic partners independently could move forward with competing products developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including BioSantes competitors; and · strategic partners could terminate or delay the arrangement or allow it to expire, which would delay the development or commercialization of the partnered product and may increase the cost of developing or commercializing the partnered product. Although BioSante maintains the right to receive sales-based milestones of up to $140 million, its ability to receive these milestones is dependent upon Medas ability to market and sell Elestrin, and based on Elestrin sales to date, BioSante believes it is unlikely that it will receive any sales-based milestone payments from Meda in the foreseeable future, or at all. Meda (which acquired Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s womens health business, and which in turn had acquired BioSantes original licensee, Azur Pharma International II Limited (Azur)), is marketing Elestrin in the U.S. In December 2009, BioSante entered into an amendment to its original licensing agreement with Azur pursuant to which BioSante received $3.16 million in non-refundable payments in exchange for the elimination of all remaining future royalty payments and certain milestone payments that could have been paid to BioSante related to sales of Elestrin. BioSante continues to recognize certain royalty revenue from sales of 41 Table of Contents Elestrin; however, such revenue is offset by its corresponding obligation to pay royalties to Antares, from whom BioSante licensed the technology underlying its Elestrin product. BioSante maintains the right to receive up to $140 million in sales-based milestone payments from Meda if Elestrin reaches certain predefined sales per calendar year. BioSante can provide no assurance that Meda will be successful in marketing Elestrin, Elestrin will be accepted widely in the marketplace or that Meda will remain focused on the commercialization of Elestrin, especially if Meda does not experience significant Elestrin sales. Based on current sales of Elestrin, BioSante believes it is unlikely that BioSante will receive any sales-based milestone payments from Meda in the near term, if at all. If BioSantes products in development receive FDA approval and are introduced commercially, they may not achieve expected levels of market acceptance, which could harm BioSantes business, financial position and operating results and could cause the trading price of BioSante common stock to decline. The commercial success of BioSantes products in development, if BioSante receives the required FDA or other regulatory approvals, and the commercial success of its male testosterone gel, which is FDA approved, but not yet commercially launched, are dependent upon acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community. Levels of market acceptance for such products, if approved for commercial sale with respect to BioSantes products in development, could be affected by several factors, including: · demonstration of efficacy and safety in clinical trials with respect to BioSantes products in development; · the existence, prevalence and severity of any side effects; · the availability of competitive or alternative treatments and potential or perceived advantages or disadvantages compared to competitive or alternative treatments; · the timing of market entry relative to competitive treatments; · relative convenience, product dependability and ease of administration; · the strength of marketing and distribution support; · the sufficiency of coverage and reimbursement of BioSantes products by third-party payors and governmental and other payors; and · the product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries. Some of these factors are not within BioSantes control, especially if BioSante has transferred all of the marketing rights associated with the product, as BioSante has with the U.S. marketing rights to Elestrin to Meda, and the U.S. development and marketing rights to its male testosterone gel to Teva. BioSantes products may not achieve expected levels of market acceptance. Additionally, continuing studies of the proper utilization, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products are being conducted by other companies, government agencies and others. Such studies, which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques, can call into question the use, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and in the future may result, in the discontinuance of product marketing. These situations, should they occur, could harm BioSantes business, financial position and results of operations, and the trading price of BioSante common stock could decline. 42 Table of Contents Even if BioSante or its strategic partners successfully develop, obtain required regulatory approvals and commercialize any of its products under development, BioSante faces uncertainty with respect to pricing, third-party reimbursement and healthcare reform, all of which could affect adversely the commercial success of BioSantes products. BioSantes ability to collect significant revenues from sales of its products, if approved and commercialized, may depend on its ability, and the ability of any current or potential future strategic partners or customers, to obtain adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for such products from third-party payers such as: · private health insurers; · health maintenance organizations; · pharmacy benefit management companies; · government health administration authorities; and · other healthcare-related organizations. Third-party payers increasingly are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. For example, third-party payers may deny coverage or offer inadequate levels of reimbursement if they determine that a prescribed product has not received appropriate clearances from the FDA, or foreign equivalent, or other government regulators, is not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by the third-party payer, or is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. Prices also could be driven down by health maintenance organizations that control or significantly influence purchases of healthcare services and products. If third-party payers deny coverage or offer inadequate levels of reimbursement, BioSante or any of its strategic partners may not be able to market its products effectively or it may be required to offer its products at prices lower than anticipated. In both the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals and initiatives to change the health care system in ways that could affect BioSantes ability to sell its products profitably. Some of these proposed and implemented reforms could result in reduced reimbursement rates for BioSantes products, which could affect adversely its business strategy, operations and financial results. For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law a legislative overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system, known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, which is referred to as the PPACA. This legislation may have far reaching consequences for life science companies like BioSante. As a result of this new legislation, substantial changes could be made to the current system for paying for healthcare in the United States, including changes made in order to extend medical benefits to those who currently lack insurance coverage. Extending coverage to a large population could substantially change the structure of the health insurance system and the methodology for reimbursing medical services, drugs and devices. These structural changes could entail modifications to the existing system of private payors and government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, creation of a government-sponsored healthcare insurance source, or some combination of both, as well as other changes. Restructuring the coverage of medical care in the United States could impact the reimbursement for prescribed drugs, biopharmaceuticals and medical devices. If reimbursement for BioSantes products, if approved, is substantially less that BioSante expects in the future, its business could be affected materially and adversely. The cost-containment measures that healthcare providers are instituting and the results of healthcare reforms such as the PPACA may prevent BioSante from maintaining prices for its products that are sufficient for BioSante to realize profits and may otherwise significantly harm its business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, to the extent that BioSantes approved products are marketed outside of the 43 Table of Contents United States, foreign government pricing controls and other regulations may prevent BioSante from maintaining prices for such products that are sufficient for BioSante to realize profits and may otherwise significantly harm its business, financial condition and operating results. BioSante and its licensees depend on third-party manufacturers to produce its products and if these third parties do not manufacture successfully these products BioSantes business would be harmed. BioSante has no manufacturing experience or manufacturing capabilities for the production of its products for its clinical studies or, if approved, commercial sale. In order to continue to develop products, apply for regulatory approvals and commercialize BioSantes products following approval, if obtained, BioSante or its licensees must be able to manufacture or contract with third parties to manufacture its products in clinical and commercial quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements, at acceptable costs and in a timely manner. The manufacture of BioSantes products may be complex, difficult to accomplish and difficult to scale-up when large-scale production is required. Manufacture may be subject to delays, inefficiencies and poor or low yields of quality products. The cost of manufacturing BioSantes products may make them prohibitively expensive. If supplies of any of BioSantes products become unavailable on a timely basis or at all or are contaminated or otherwise lost, BioSantes clinical studies could be seriously delayed or compromised, and with respect to its approved products, its future revenue from royalties and milestone payments could be affected adversely. To the extent that BioSante or its licensees enter into manufacturing arrangements with third parties, BioSante and such licensees will depend upon these third parties to perform its obligations in a timely and effective manner and in accordance with government regulations. Contract manufacturers may breach their manufacturing agreements because of factors beyond BioSantes control or may terminate or fail to renew a manufacturing agreement based on their own business priorities at a time that is costly or inconvenient for BioSante. BioSantes existing and future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to successfully produce, store and distribute BioSantes products. If a natural disaster, business failure, strike or other difficulty occurs, BioSante may be unable to replace these contract manufacturers in a timely or cost-effective manner and the production of its products would be interrupted, resulting in delays and additional costs. Switching manufacturers or manufacturing sites would be difficult and time-consuming because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. In addition, before a product from any replacement manufacturer or manufacturing site can be commercialized, the FDA must approve that site. This approval would require regulatory testing and compliance inspections. A new manufacturer or manufacturing site also would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of BioSantes products. It may be difficult or impossible to transfer certain elements of a manufacturing process to a new manufacturer or for BioSante to find a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms quickly, or at all, either of which would delay or prevent its ability to develop and commercialize its products. If third-party manufacturers fail to perform their obligations, BioSantes competitive position and ability to generate revenue may be affected adversely in a number of ways, including: · BioSante and its strategic partners may be unable to initiate or continue clinical studies of its products that are under development; · BioSante and its strategic partners may be delayed in submitting applications for regulatory approvals for its products that are under development; and · BioSante and its strategic partners may be unable to meet commercial demands for any approved products. 44 Table of Contents In addition, if a third-party manufacturer fails to perform as agreed, BioSantes ability to collect damages may be contractually limited. If BioSante reallocates its resources to other products and technologies in its current product portfolio or any additional new products and technologies that BioSante may acquire or in-license, BioSante may not be successful in developing such products and technologies and BioSante will be subject to all the risks and uncertainties associated with research and development of products and technologies. BioSante has explored the possibility of reallocating its resources towards other products and technologies in its current product portfolio or any additional new products and technologies that BioSante may acquire or in-license. It BioSante decides to reallocate its resources towards other products and technologies in its current product portfolio or any additional new products and technologies that BioSante may acquire or in-license, BioSante cannot guarantee that any such allocation would result in the identification and successful development of one or more approved and commercially viable products. The development of products and technologies is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including: · the time, costs and uncertainty associated with the clinical testing required to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of BioSantes products and obtain regulatory approvals; · the ability to raise sufficient funds to fund the research and development of BioSantes products; · the ability to find third party strategic partners to assist or share in the costs of product development, and potential dependence on such strategic partners, to the extent BioSante relies on them for future sales, marketing or distribution; · the ability to protect the intellectual property rights associated with BioSantes products; · litigation; · competition; · ability to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements; · government restrictions on the pricing and profitability of products in the United States and elsewhere; and · the extent to which third-party payers, including government agencies, private health care insurers and other health care payers, such as health maintenance organizations, and self-insured employee plans, will cover and pay for newly approved therapies. BioSante has very limited staffing and is dependent upon key employees and the limited use of independent contractors, the loss of some of which could affect adversely its operations. BioSantes success is dependent upon the efforts of a relatively small management team and staff. BioSante also has engaged independent contractors from time-to-time on an as needed, project by project, basis. During 2012, in order to reduce BioSantes operating expenses, BioSante terminated all of its independent contractor arrangements and reduced its total employee headcount. Such reductions in force, combined with BioSantes future business prospects and financial condition, put BioSante at risk of losing key personnel who BioSante will need going forward to implement its business strategies. BioSante has no redundancy of personnel in key development areas, including clinical, regulatory, strategic planning and finance. BioSante has employment arrangements in place with its executive and other officers, but none of these executive and other officers is bound legally to remain employed with BioSante for any specific term. BioSante does not have key man life insurance policies covering its executive and other officers or any of its 45 Table of Contents other employees. If key individuals leave BioSante, its business could be affected adversely if suitable replacement personnel are not recruited quickly. There is competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industry in the suburban Chicago, Illinois area in all functional areas, which makes it difficult to retain and attract the qualified personnel necessary for the development and growth of BioSantes business. BioSantes financial condition and recent reductions in force and expense reductions may make it difficult for BioSante to retain current personnel and attract qualified employees and independent contractors in the future. If plaintiffs bring product liability lawsuits against BioSante, BioSante may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to delay development or limit commercialization of any of BioSantes products approved for commercial sale. BioSante faces an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of its products in development and the commercial sale of its products that have been or will be approved for commercial sale. BioSante may be held liable if any product it develops causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in decreased demand for BioSantes products, injury to its reputation, withdrawal of clinical studies, costs to defend litigation, substantial monetary awards to clinical study participants or patients, loss of revenue and the inability to commercialize any products that BioSante develops. BioSante currently maintains limited product liability insurance. BioSante may not have sufficient resources to pay for any liabilities resulting from a personal injury or other claim excluded from, or beyond the limit of, BioSantes insurance coverage. BioSantes insurance does not cover third parties negligence or malpractice, and its clinical investigators and sites may have inadequate insurance or none at all. In addition, in order to conduct BioSantes clinical studies or otherwise carry out its business, BioSante may have to assume liabilities contractually for which it may not be insured. If BioSante is unable to look to its own or a third partys insurance to pay claims against them, BioSante may have to pay any arising costs and damages themselves, which may be substantial. Even if BioSante ultimately is successful in product liability litigation, the litigation likely would consume substantial amounts of its financial and managerial resources and may create adverse publicity, all of which likely would impair BioSantes ability to generate sales of the affected product and its other products. Moreover, product recalls may be issued at BioSantes discretion or at the direction of the FDA, other governmental agencies or other companies having regulatory control for its product sales. Product recalls generally are expensive and often have an adverse effect on the reputation of the products being recalled and of the products developer or manufacturer. BioSante may be required to indemnify third parties against damages and other liabilities arising out of its development, commercialization and other business activities, which could be costly and time-consuming and distract management. If third parties that have agreed to indemnify BioSante against damages and other liabilities arising from their activities do not fulfill their obligations, then BioSante may be held responsible for those damages and other liabilities. Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of BioSante common stock. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires BioSantes management to assess the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting and to provide a report by its registered independent public accounting firm addressing the effectiveness of BioSantes internal control over financial reporting. The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) provides a framework for companies to assess and improve their internal control systems. If BioSante is unable to assert that its internal control over financial reporting is effective or if BioSantes registered independent public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal controls or identifies one or more material weaknesses in BioSantes internal control over financial reporting, BioSante could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect 46 Table of Contents on the trading price of BioSante common stock. If BioSante fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, BioSante may not be able to ensure that it can conclude on an ongoing basis that BioSante has effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on the trading price of BioSante common stock. BioSantes business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance, public disclosure and accounting requirements that could affect adversely its business and financial results. BioSante is subject to changing rules and regulations of federal and state governments as well as the stock exchange on which BioSante common stock is listed. These entities, including the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market, continue to issue new requirements and regulations in response to laws enacted by Congress. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. BioSantes efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a diversion of managements time from its other business activities. BioSantes operations might be interrupted by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event. BioSantes principal executive office and its only business location is in Lincolnshire, Illinois, which is a suburb of Chicago. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events could disrupt BioSantes operations or those of its strategic partners, contractors and vendors. Even though BioSante believes it carries commercially reasonable business interruption and liability insurance, and its contractors may carry liability insurance that protect BioSante in certain events, BioSante might suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under its and its contractors insurance policies or for which it or its contractors do not have coverage. Any natural disaster or catastrophic event could have a significant negative impact on BioSantes operations and financial results, and could delay its efforts to identify and execute any strategic opportunities. Risks Related to BioSantes Industry Because BioSantes industry is very competitive, BioSante may not succeed in bringing certain of its products to market and any products BioSante or its strategic partners introduce commercially may not be successful. Competition in the pharmaceutical industry is intense. Potential competitors in the United States and abroad are numerous and include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, most of which have substantially greater capital resources and more experience in research and development, manufacturing and marketing than BioSante. Academic institutions, hospitals, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also are conducting research and seeking patent protection and may develop and commercially introduce competing products or technologies on their own or through joint ventures. BioSante cannot assure you that its potential competitors, some of whom are BioSantes strategic partners, will not succeed in developing similar technologies and products more rapidly than it does, commercially introducing such technologies and products to the marketplace prior to BioSante, or that these competing technologies and products will not be more effective or successful than any of those that BioSante currently is developing or will develop. 47 Table of Contents Because the pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, BioSante faces significant costs and uncertainties associated with its efforts to comply with applicable regulations. Should BioSante fail to comply, it could experience material adverse effects on its business, operating results and financial position, and the trading price of BioSante common stock could decline. The pharmaceutical industry is subject to regulation by various federal authorities, including principally the FDA and, to a lesser extent, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and state governmental authorities. The U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing, manufacturing, packing, labeling, storing, record keeping, safety, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of BioSantes products. Noncompliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements can have a broad range of consequences, including warning letters, fines, seizure of products, product recalls, total or partial suspension of production and distribution, refusal to approve NDAs or other applications or revocation of approvals previously granted, withdrawal of product from marketing, injunction, withdrawal of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct business, disqualification from supply contracts with the government, civil penalties, debarment and criminal prosecution. In addition to compliance with current good manufacturing practice regulations, commonly referred to as cGMP regulations and requirements, drug manufacturers must register each manufacturing facility with the FDA and list their drugs with the FDA. Manufacturers and distributors of prescription drug products also are required to be registered in the states where they are located and in certain states that require registration by out-of-state manufacturers and distributors. Manufacturers also must be registered with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and similar applicable state and local regulatory authorities if they handle controlled substances, and also must comply with other applicable U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and state requirements. Despite BioSantes efforts at compliance, there is no guarantee that BioSante may not be deemed to be deficient in some manner in the future. If BioSante was deemed to be deficient in any significant way, its business, financial position and results of operations could be materially affected and the trading price of BioSante common stock could decline. The trend towards consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may affect BioSante adversely. There is a trend towards consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. This consolidation trend may result in the remaining companies in these industries having greater financial resources and technological capabilities, thus intensifying competition in these industries. This trend also may result in fewer potential strategic partners or licensees for BioSantes products and technology. Also, if a consolidating company is already doing business with its competitors, BioSante may lose existing licensees or strategic partners as a result of such consolidation. This trend may affect adversely BioSantes ability to enter into strategic arrangements for the development and commercialization of its products, and as a result may harm its business. Risks Related to BioSantes Intellectual Property BioSante licenses rights to the technology underlying LibiGel and many of its other products and technologies from third parties. The loss of these rights, including in particular, BioSantes rights underlying LibiGel, could have an adverse effect on its business and future prospects and could cause the trading price of BioSante common stock to decline. BioSante licenses rights to certain technology underlying its gel products, including LibiGel, but not its male testosterone gel, from Antares Pharma, Inc. and The Pill Plus from Wake Forest University Health Sciences. BioSante may lose its rights to these technologies if BioSante breaches its obligations under the 48 Table of Contents license agreements. Although BioSante intends to use commercially reasonable efforts to meet these obligations and to cause its sublicensees to meet these obligations, if BioSante violates or fails to perform any term or covenant of the license agreements, the other party to these agreements under certain circumstances may terminate these agreements or certain projects contained in these agreements. The termination of these agreements, however, will not relieve BioSante of its obligation to pay any royalty or license fees owed at the time of termination. In addition, it is possible that the licensors of the technology licensed by BioSante will not continue to maintain certain patents and other intellectual property rights, breach the agreements or take actions inconsistent with BioSantes license rights, which could harm BioSantes business. BioSante has licensed some of its products to third parties and any breach by these parties of their obligations under these license agreements or a termination of these license agreements by these parties could affect adversely the development and marketing of its licensed products. In addition, these third parties also may compete with BioSante with respect to some of its products. BioSante has licensed some of its products to third parties, including Meda, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., Pantarhei Bioscience B.V. and Valeant Pharmaceuticals. All of these parties, except for Meda, have agreed to be responsible for continued development, regulatory filings and manufacturing and marketing associated with the products, except for Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which has not agreed to be responsible for manufacturing the products. In addition, in the future BioSante may enter into additional similar license agreements. BioSantes products that it has licensed to others thus are subject to not only customary and inevitable uncertainties associated with the drug development process, regulatory approvals and market acceptance of products, but also depend on the respective licensees for timely development, obtaining required regulatory approvals, commercialization and otherwise continued commitment to the products. BioSantes current and future licensees may have different and, sometimes, competing priorities. BioSante cannot assure you that its strategic partners or any future third party to whom it may license its products will remain focused on the development and commercialization of its partnered products or will not otherwise breach the terms of its agreements with them, especially since these third parties also may compete with BioSante with respect to some of its products. Any breach of BioSantes agreements by its strategic partners or any other third party of their obligations under these agreements or a termination of these agreements by these parties could harm development of the partnered products in these agreements if BioSante is unable to license the products to another party on substantially the same or better terms or continue the development and future commercialization of the products itself. As an example, BioSantes male testosterone gel was developed initially by BioSante, and then licensed to Teva for late stage clinical development and commercialization. Teva submitted an NDA for BioSantes male testosterone gel that was approved by the FDA in February 2012. Subsequent to Tevas NDA submission, in April 2011, AbbVie Inc., a marketer of a testosterone gel for men, filed a complaint against Teva alleging patent infringement. The Teva/AbbVie patent infringement litigation was settled in December 2011; however, the terms of the settlement agreement are confidential and have not been disclosed publicly. In light of the settlement agreement, BioSante is uncertain as to when or if Teva will begin to market and sell its male testosterone gel and thus when or if BioSante would begin to receive royalties from such sales. If BioSante is unable to protect its proprietary technology, it may not be able to compete as effectively. The pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes. BioSantes success will depend, in part, upon its ability to obtain, enjoy and enforce protection for any products it develops or acquires under United States and foreign patent laws and other intellectual property laws, preserve the confidentiality of its trade secrets and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. BioSante relies on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright and trademark laws and nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual arrangements to protect its proprietary technology. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect BioSantes rights or permit BioSante to gain or keep any competitive advantage. 49 Table of Contents Where appropriate, BioSante seeks patent protection for certain aspects of its technology. BioSante owned and licensed patents and patent applications, however, may not ensure the protection of its intellectual property for a number of other reasons: · BioSante does not know whether its licensors patent applications will result in issued patents. · Competitors may interfere with BioSantes patents and patent process in a variety of ways. BioSante issued patents and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit its ability to stop competitors from marketing related products. Competitors also may have BioSantes patents reexamined by demonstrating to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office examiner that the invention was not novel or was obvious. · BioSante is engaged in the process of developing products. Even if BioSante receives a patent, it may not provide much practical protection. There is no assurance that third parties will not be able to design around BioSantes patents. If BioSante receives a patent with a narrow scope, then it will be easier for competitors to design products that do not infringe on BioSantes patent. Even if the development of BioSantes products is successful and approval for sale is obtained, there can be no assurance that applicable patent coverage, if any, will not have expired or will not expire shortly after this approval. Though patent term extension may be possible for particular products, any expiration of the applicable patent could have a material adverse effect on the sales and profitability of BioSantes products. · Litigation also may be necessary to enforce patent rights BioSante holds or to protect trade secrets or techniques it owns. Intellectual property litigation is costly and may affect adversely BioSantes operating results. Such litigation also may require significant time by BioSantes management. In litigation, a competitor could claim that BioSantes issued patents are not valid or unenforceable for a number of reasons. If the court agrees, BioSante would lose protection on products covered by those patents. · BioSante also may support and collaborate in research conducted by government organizations or universities. BioSante cannot guarantee that it will be able to acquire any rights to technology or products derived from these collaborations. If BioSante does not obtain required licenses or rights, it could encounter delays in product development while it attempts to design around other patents or it may be prohibited from developing, manufacturing or selling products requiring these licenses. There also is a risk that disputes may arise as to the rights to technology or products developed in collaboration with other parties. BioSante also relies on unpatented proprietary technology. It is unclear whether efforts to secure BioSantes trade secrets will provide useful protection. BioSante relies on the use of registered trademarks with respect to the branded names of some of its products. BioSante also relies on common law trademark protection for some branded names, which are not protected to the same extent as its rights in the use of its registered trademarks. BioSante cannot assure you that it will be able to meaningfully protect all of its rights in its unpatented proprietary technology or that others will not independently develop and obtain patent protection substantially equivalent proprietary products or processes or otherwise gain access to its unpatented proprietary technology. BioSante seeks to protect its know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology, in part with confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with BioSantes employees and consultants. Such agreements, however, may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for BioSantes proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements or in the event that its competitors discover or independently develop similar or identical designs or other proprietary information. Enforcing a claim that someone else illegally obtained and is using BioSantes trade secrets, like patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. 50 Table of Contents The patent protection for BioSantes products may expire before BioSante is able to maximize their commercial value which may subject BioSante to increased competition, inhibit its ability to find strategic partners and reduce or eliminate its opportunity to generate product revenue. The patents for BioSantes commercialized products and products in development have varying expiration dates and, when these patents expire, BioSante may be subject to increased competition and it may not be able to recover its development costs. For example, the U.S. patents covering the formulations used in Elestrin and LibiGel which BioSante licenses from Antares Pharma are scheduled to expire in June 2022 and the U.S. patent covering the method of use of LibiGel for treating FSD and HSDD will expire in December 2028. Although BioSante has filed additional U.S. patent applications covering LibiGel, it can provide no assurance that such applications will be granted and that the patent applications will issue. In addition to patents, BioSante may receive three years of marketing exclusivity in the United States for LibiGel under the Hatch-Waxman Act and an additional six months of pediatric exclusivity, if BioSante decides to pursue regulatory approval for LibiGel. Depending upon if and when BioSante receives regulatory approval for LibiGel and its other products in development and the then expiration dates of the patents underlying LibiGel and such other products, BioSante may not have sufficient time to recover its development costs prior to the expiration of such patents and consequently it may be difficult to find a strategic partner for such products. Claims by others that BioSantes products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights could adversely affect BioSantes operating results and financial condition. The pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Patent applications are maintained in secrecy in the United States and outside the United States until the application is published. Accordingly, BioSante cannot determine whether its technology would infringe on patents arising from these unpublished patent applications of others. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time-consuming and could likely: · result in costly litigation; · divert the time and attention of BioSantes technical personnel and management; · cause product development delays; · require BioSante to develop non-infringing technology; or · require BioSante to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Although patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry often have been settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and often require the payment of ongoing royalties, which could hurt BioSantes potential gross margins. In addition, BioSante cannot be sure that the necessary licenses would be available to BioSante on satisfactory terms, or that it could redesign its products or processes to avoid patent infringement, if necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or the failure to obtain necessary licenses, could prevent BioSante from developing, manufacturing and selling some of its products, which could harm its business, financial condition and operating results. With respect to products which BioSante has licensed to others, BioSantes licensees may be responsible for the defense of any patent infringement claims, which would result in its dependence upon them to defend its intellectual property rights. 51 Table of Contents Risks Related to BioSante Common Stock The trading price of BioSante common stock has been volatile, and your investment in BioSante common stock or convertible senior notes could decline in value. The price of BioSante common stock has fluctuated in the past and it is likely that the price of BioSante common stock will continue to fluctuate in the future. Since January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012, the sale price of BioSante common stock ranged from $1.08 per share to $24.12 per share. These prices reflect the one-for-six reverse stock split of BioSante common stock that was effective at the close of business on June 1, 2012. The securities of small capitalization, biopharmaceutical companies, including BioSante, from time-to- time experience significant price fluctuations, often unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. In addition, as BioSantes convertible senior notes are convertible into shares of BioSante common stock, volatility or depressed prices of BioSante common stock could have a similar effect on the trading price of the notes. Interest rate fluctuations also can affect the price of BioSantes convertible senior notes. In particular, the market price of BioSante common stock and its convertible senior notes may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including: · general stock market and general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, not directly related to BioSante or its business; · actual or anticipated governmental agency actions, including in particular decisions or actions by the FDA or FDA advisory committee panels with respect to BioSantes products in development or its competitors products; · actual or anticipated results of BioSantes clinical studies or those of its competitors; · changes in anticipated or actual timing of BioSantes development programs, including delays or cancellations of clinical studies for its products; · announcements of technological innovations or new products by BioSante or its competitors; · announcements by licensors or licensees of BioSantes technology; · entering into new strategic partnering arrangements or termination of existing strategic partnering arrangements; · developments concerning BioSantes efforts to identify and implement strategic opportunities and the terms and timing of any resulting transactions; · public concern as to the safety or efficacy of or market acceptance of products developed by BioSante or its competitors; · BioSantes cash and cash equivalents and its need and ability to obtain additional financing; · equity sales by BioSante to fund its operations or restructure its outstanding convertible senior notes; · changes in laws or regulations applicable to BioSantes products; · the resolution of BioSantes pending purported class action and shareholder derivative litigation; · developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights; 52 Table of Contents · period-to-period fluctuations in BioSantes financial results, including its cash and cash equivalents, operating expenses, cash burn rate or revenues; · loss of key management; · common stock sales and purchases in the public market by one or more of BioSantes larger stockholders, officers or directors; · reports issued by securities analysts regarding BioSante common stock and articles published regarding its business and/or products; · changes in the market valuations of other life science or biotechnology companies; and · other financial announcements, including delisting of BioSante common stock from The NASDAQ Global Market, review of any of its filings by the SEC, changes in accounting treatment or restatement of previously reported financial results, delays in its filings with the SEC or its failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the occurrence of any of the risks described in this report or in subsequent reports BioSante files with or submits to the SEC from time to time could have a material and adverse impact on the market price of BioSante common stock. Securities class action litigation is sometimes brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities or for other reasons. BioSante currently is subject to such litigation. Securities litigation, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources, which could harm BioSantes business and financial condition, as well as the market price of BioSante common stock. Provisions in BioSantes charter documents and Delaware law could discourage or prevent a takeover, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to BioSante stockholders. Provisions of BioSantes certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire BioSante, even if doing so would be beneficial to its stockholders. These provisions include: · authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred shares that could be issued by the BioSante board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt; · prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates; and · advance notice provisions in connection with stockholder proposals and director nominations that may prevent or hinder any attempt by BioSante stockholders to bring business to be considered by its stockholders at a meeting or replace its board of directors. BioSante does not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future; and, therefore, any return on an investment in BioSante common stock must come from increases in the fair market value and trading price of BioSante common stock. BioSante does not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future; and, therefore, any return on an investment in BioSante common stock must come from increases in the fair market value and trading price of BioSante common stock. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.
