Item 1A. Risk Factors.Most issuers, including Kemper, are exposed to numerous risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from recent results or anticipated future results. The following discussion details the significant risk factors that are more specific to the Company. In addition to those described below, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially affected by other factors not presently known by, or considered material to, the Company. Readers are advised to consider these factors along with the other information included in this 2011 Annual Report, and to consult any further disclosures Kemper makes on related subjects in its filings with the SEC.Catastrophe losses, whether resulting from natural disasters, terrorism or other man-made events, and reinsurance risks could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.Kemper’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail storms, explosions, severe winter weather and wildfires and may include man-made events, such as terrorist attacks and hazardous material spills. The incidence, frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, and may be impacted by the uncertain effects of climate change. The extent of the Company’s losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event.Kemper’s Life and Health Insurance subsidiaries are particularly exposed to risks of catastrophic mortality, such as pandemic or other events that result in large numbers of deaths. In addition, the occurrence of such an event in a concentrated geographic area could have a severe disruptive effect on the Company’s workforce and business operations. The likelihood and severity of such events can not be predicted and are difficult to estimate.Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries seek to reduce their exposure to catastrophe losses through underwriting strategies and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance. Reinsurance does not relieve Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries of their direct liability to their policyholders. As long as the reinsurers meet their obligations, the net liability for Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries is limited to the amount of risk that they retain. While the Company’s principal reinsurers are each rated “A-” or better by A.M. Best at the time reinsurance is purchased, the Company cannot be certain that reinsurers will pay the amounts due from them either now, in the future, or on a timely basis. A reinsurer’s insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.In addition, market conditions beyond the Company’s control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection that Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries may purchase. A decrease in the amount of reinsurance protection that Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries purchase generally should decrease their cost of reinsurance, but increase their risk of loss. An increase in the amount of reinsurance protection that Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries purchase generally should increase their cost of reinsurance, but decrease their risk of loss. However, if the amount of available reinsurance is reduced, Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries could pay more for the same level, or a lower level, of reinsurance coverage. Accordingly, the Company may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect the ability of Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries to write future insurance policies or result in their retaining more risk with respect to such insurance policies.Estimating losses and LAE for determining property and casualty insurance reserves, or determining premium rates, is inherently uncertain, and the Company’s results of operations may be materially impacted if the Company’s insurance reserves or premium rates are insufficient.The Company establishes loss and LAE reserves to cover estimated liabilities, which remain unpaid as of the end of each accounting period, and to investigate and settle all claims incurred under the property and casualty insurance policies that it has issued. Loss and LAE reserves are established for claims that have been reported to the Company as of the end of the accounting period, as well as for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the Company. The estimates of loss and LAE reserves are based on the Company’s assessment of the facts and circumstances known to it at the time, as well as estimates of the impact of future trends in the severity of claims, the frequency of claims and other factors. See MD&A, “Critical Accounting Estimates,” under the caption “Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses” beginning on page 57 for a discussion of the Company’s reserving process and the factors considered by the Company’s actuaries in estimating the Company’s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves. 16As the process of estimating property and casualty insurance reserves is inherently uncertain, the reserves established by the Company are not precise estimates of liability and could prove to be inadequate to cover its ultimate losses and expenses for insured events that have occurred. The process of estimating loss reserves is complex and imprecise. The estimate of the ultimate cost of claims for insured events that have occurred must take into consideration many factors that are dependent on the outcome of future events associated with the reporting, investigation and settlement of claims. The impacts on the Company’s estimates of property and casualty insurance reserves from these factors are difficult to assess accurately. A change in any one or more of the factors is likely to result in a projected ultimate loss that is different than the previous projected ultimate loss, and may have a material impact on the Company’s estimate of the projected ultimate loss. Increases in the estimates of ultimate losses and LAE will decrease earnings, while decreases in such estimates will increase earnings, as reported by the Company in the results of its operations for the periods in which the changes to the estimates are made by the Company.The Company’s actuaries also consider trends in the severity and frequency of claims and other factors, when determining the premium rates to charge for its property and casualty insurance products. An unanticipated change in any one or more of these factors or trends, as well as a change in competitive conditions, may also result in inadequate premium rates charged for insurance policies issued by Kemper’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries in the future. Such pricing inadequacies could have a material impact on the Company’s operating results.The Direct segment may not reach profitability or an adequate rate of return.The Direct segment reported significant operating losses in 2011 and 2009 and operated slightly below break-even in 2010. The Company has taken a number of actions intended to improve Direct’s operating results including, but not limited to, implementing premium rate increases in most states, non-renewing policies in certain states, subject to regulatory restrictions, improving insurance risk selection and retention, reducing marketing spending, modifying its direct marketing program to target a better response rate and introducing new products and a new brand. However, there is no assurance that Direct will be profitable or reach an adequate rate of return in future years.The adaption of Reserve National’s business model in response to American health care reform may be unsuccessful.Reserve National’s business model, which focuses on providing limited health insurance coverages to persons who lack access to traditional private options, is likely to be adversely affected by the Health Care Acts. In response, Reserve National has begun adapting its business model by placing emphasis on designing and selling supplemental health insurance products that are not subject to the Health Care Acts and ceasing to issue health insurance products that are subject to the Health Care Acts. In particular, Reserve National has ceased issuing health insurance products that are subject to certain provisions that establish minimum loss ratios for health insurance policies significantly above the levels historically experienced by Reserve National. While this action is likely to mitigate Reserve National’s risk, the minimum loss provisions could adversely impact its ability to achieve an adequate return on its renewal book of such health insurance products. If Reserve National’s sales of supplemental health insurance products that are not subject to the Health Care Acts are insufficient to offset the loss of business subject to the Health Care Acts, a significant loss of business for Reserve National may result. A significant loss of business could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, the results of operations and the valuation of Reserve National.Kemper is dependent on receiving dividends from its subsidiaries to service its debt and to pay dividends to its shareholders.As a holding company with no business operations of its own, Kemper depends on the dividend income that it receives from its subsidiaries as the primary source of funds to pay interest and principal on its outstanding debt obligations and to pay dividends to its shareholders. Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions under state insurance laws and regulations which limit their ability to declare and pay dividends. These laws and regulations impose minimum solvency and liquidity requirements on dividends between affiliated companies and require prior notice to, and may require approval from, state insurance regulators before dividends can be paid. The inability of one or more of Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries to pay sufficient dividends to Kemper may materially affect Kemper’s ability to timely pay its debt obligations or to pay dividends to its shareholders.A significant downgrade in the ratings of Kemper or its insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect the Company.Third-party ratings agencies, such as A.M. Best, assess the financial strength and rate the claims-paying ability of insurance companies based on criteria established by the ratings agencies. Third-party ratings are important competitive factors in the insurance industry. Financial strength ratings are used to assess the financial strength and quality of insurers. A significant downgrade by a recognized ratings agency in the ratings of Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries, particularly those that market their products through independent agents, affinity relationships or the internet or other direct marketing channels, could result in a 17substantial loss of business if agents or policyholders of such subsidiaries move to other companies with higher claims-paying and financial strength ratings. Any substantial loss of business could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of such subsidiaries. A downgrade in Kemper’s credit rating by Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Services (“Moody’s”) or Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) may reduce Kemper’s ability to access the capital markets for general corporate purposes or refinance existing debt.Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulation by state insurance departments.Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which they do business. Current regulations encompass a wide variety of matters, including policy forms, premium rates, licensing, trade practices, claims practices, investment standards, statutory capital and surplus requirements, reserve and loss ratio requirements, restrictions on transactions among affiliates and consumer privacy.Insurance regulatory agencies conduct periodic examinations of Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. If an insurance company fails to obtain required licenses or approvals, or if any of Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries fail to comply with other regulatory requirements, the regulatory agencies can suspend or delay their operations or licenses, require corrective action, and impose penalties or other remedies available under the applicable laws and regulations.These laws and regulations, and their interpretation by the various regulatory agencies and courts, are undergoing continual revision and expansion. The regulatory structures in the financial services industry have come under intense scrutiny as a result of the turmoil experienced by the financial markets. While it is not possible to predict how new legislation or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may impact the operations of Kemper’s subsidiaries, two recent developments have the potential to significantly impact such operations.In July 2010, the DFA was enacted into law. For more information about the potential impact of the DFA on the Company’s operations, see “Dodd-Frank Act” under “Regulation” in Item 1, beginning on page 15.In addition, the NAIC adopted extensive modifications to its Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and related regulation in December 2010. At least three states have already adopted legislation that incorporates the principal aspects of the NAIC’s proposed revisions, and it is reasonable to assume that the various other state legislatures and regulators will enact conforming revisions into law to maintain their accredited status with the NAIC. These modifications will, among other things, substantially expand the oversight and examination powers of state insurance regulators, not only with respect to licensed insurance companies, but also with respect to their presently unregulated non-insurance affiliates, and will impose new reporting requirements on the ultimate controlling persons of such insurance companies with respect to, among other things, enterprise risk to the organization as a whole, affiliated transactions, and any divestiture of controlling interests in an insurer.These new developments (including regulations that have been or that are required to be promulgated under the DFA), as well as significant changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws and regulations could make it more expensive for Kemper’s subsidiaries to conduct their businesses and could materially affect the profitability of their operations and the Company’s financial results. See the discussion in the risk factor above entitled “The adaption of Reserve National’s business model in response to American health care reform may be unsuccessful” regarding the potential effect of the Health Care Acts on Reserve National’s business model. For a more detailed discussion of the regulations applicable to Kemper’s subsidiaries, see “Insurance Regulation” under “Regulation” in Item 1, beginning on page 14.The Company is subject to interest rate risk and credit risk in its fixed maturity investment portfolio.One of the Company’s primary market risk exposures is to changes in interest rates. A decline in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Company’s investment income as it invests cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolio’s average rate. In a declining interest rate environment, borrowers may seek to refinance their borrowings at lower rates and, accordingly, prepay or redeem securities the Company holds as investments more quickly than the Company initially expected. Such prepayment or redemption action may cause the Company to reinvest the redeemed proceeds in lower yielding investments. An increase in market interest rates could also have an adverse effect on the value of the Company’s investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority of its investment portfolio. 18The Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio is subject to credit risk from the issuers of the securities in the portfolio. Deterioration in the financial conditions of the issuers could result in a decline in the fair value of the Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio. Deterioration in the financial conditions of the issuers could also result in issuer defaults and impact the Company’s ability to recover the reported value of its fixed maturity investment portfolio. Accordingly, deterioration in the credit quality of the Company’s investment portfolio could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and financial position.The Company’s investments in limited liability investment companies and limited partnerships are concentrated in companies and partnerships that invest in distressed and mezzanine debt and secondary transactions.At December 31, 2011, Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries had $306.3 million invested in limited liability investment companies and limited partnerships accounted for under the equity method of accounting (“Equity Method Limited Liability Investments”), that invest in distressed and mezzanine debt of other companies and secondary transactions. In addition, Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries had unfunded commitments to invest an additional $132.2 million at December 31, 2011, including $78.8 million of unfunded commitments related to investments reported as Other Equity Interests and included in Equity Securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, in limited liability investment companies and limited partnerships. Such unfunded commitments generally may be used to fund additional investments made, or losses incurred, by such limited liability investment companies and limited partnerships. The underlying investments of such limited liability investment companies and limited partnerships generally provide opportunities for higher returns, but at a higher risk than investment-grade investments. General economic swings influence the performance of the underlying investments in distressed and mezzanine debt and secondary transactions. Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries have also made direct investments in the same or similar distressed and mezzanine debt securities of certain issuers in which such limited liability investment companies and limited partnerships have made investments, which could exacerbate any losses attributable to poor performance of any such investments. A severe and continued downturn in the economy may result in deterioration in the business prospects of the issuers of the underlying investments that could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and financial position.The insurance industry is highly competitive.The Company’s insurance businesses face significant competition, and its ability to compete is affected by a variety of issues relative to others in the industry, such as product pricing, service quality, financial strength and name recognition. Competitive success is based on many factors, including, but not limited to, the following:•Competitiveness of prices charged for insurance policies;•Selection of agents, web portals and other business partners;•Compensation paid to agents;•Underwriting discipline;•Selectiveness of sales markets;•Effectiveness of marketing materials;•Product and technological innovation;•Ability to detect and prevent fraudulent insurance claims;•Ability to control operating expenses;•Adequacy of ratings from A.M. Best; and•Quality of services provided to agents and policyholders.The inability to compete effectively in any of the Company’s insurance businesses could materially reduce the Company’s customer base and revenues, and could adversely affect the future results and financial condition of the Company.The Company is in the process of re-branding its operations under the Kemper name. While the Company believes that the Kemper name has more name recognition than the names used in some of its operations, there can be no assurance that such re-branding efforts will be successful. See “Change in Name of Company and Re-branding” in Item 1 of Part I beginning on page 3.See “Competition” in Item 1 of Part I beginning on page 12 and page 14, for more information on the competitive rankings in the property and casualty insurance markets and the life and health insurance markets, respectively, in the United States. 19The effects of an evolving legal and regulatory landscape on Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries are uncertain. The legal and regulatory landscape within which the Company and its subsidiaries conduct their businesses is often unpredictable. As industry practices and regulatory, judicial, political, social and other conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues may emerge. These emerging practices, conditions and issues could adversely affect Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries in a variety of ways, including by expansion of coverages beyond their underwriting intent, by increasing the number or size of claims or accelerating the payment of claims. Industry practices that were considered legally-compliant and reasonable for years may suddenly be deemed unacceptable by virtue of an unexpected court or regulatory ruling or changes in regulatory enforcement policies and practices. Anticipating such shifts in the law and the impact they may have on the Company and its operations is a difficult task and there can be no assurances that the Company will not encounter such shifts in the future. The effects of such changes are hard to predict, but could materially affect the financial results of the Company. Legal and regulatory proceedings are unpredictable.Kemper and its subsidiaries are from time to time involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of their businesses. Some of these proceedings may involve matters particular to the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries, while others may pertain to business practices in the industry in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate. Some lawsuits may seek class action status that, if granted, could expose the Company to potentially significant liability by virtue of the size of the putative classes. These matters raise difficult factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities, and the outcomes of these matters are difficult to predict, and the amounts or ranges of potential loss at particular stages in the proceedings are in most cases difficult or impossible to ascertain. A further complication is that even where the possibility of an adverse outcome is deemed to be remote using traditional legal analysis, juries sometimes can and do substitute their subjective views in place of facts and established legal principles. Given the unpredictability of the legal and regulatory landscape in which the Company operates, there can be no assurance that one or more of these matters will not produce a result which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial results for any given period. For information about the Company’s pending litigation, see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” beginning on page 21.Managing technology initiatives to address business developments and increasing data security regulations and risks present significant challenges to the Company.While technological developments can streamline many business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations, technology initiatives can present short-term cost and implementation risks. In addition, projections of expenses, implementation schedules and utility of results may be inaccurate and can escalate over time. The financial services industry is highly regulated, and the Company faces rising costs and competing time constraints in meeting compliance requirements of new and proposed regulations. Companies operating in the financial services industry obtain and store vast amounts of personal data. The expanding volume and sophistication of computer viruses, hackers and other external hazards may increase the vulnerability of the Company’s data systems, including, but not limited to, the personal data used in and stored on such systems, to security breaches. These increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements, including requirements related to personal data security, expose the Company to potential data loss and damages and significant increases in compliance and litigation costs.In addition, non-compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, an information security standard for organizations that handle cardholder information for the major debit, credit, prepaid, e-purse, ATM and point-of-sale cards, could result in fines from such organizations or the inability to transact business with customers using these cards.Item 1B.
