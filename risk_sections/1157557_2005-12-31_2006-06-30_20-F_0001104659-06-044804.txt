(4) This information is presented in U.S. dollars at the noon buying rate in effect as of the end of each year. Exchange Rates Prior to March 14, 2005 there were two principal foreign exchange markets in Brazil - the commercial rate exchange market and the floating rate exchange market. Most trade and financial foreign-exchange transactions were carried out on the commercial rate exchange market. The floating market rate generally applied to transactions to which the commercial market rate did not apply. Prior to February 1999, the exchange rate in each market was established independently, resulting in different rates during some periods. As of February 1, 1999, the Central 7 Bank of Brazil (Banco Central do Brazil), or the Central Bank, placed the commercial rate exchange market and the floating rate exchange market under identical operational limits, which led to a convergence in the pricing and liquidity of both markets. On March 4, 2005, the National Monetary Council (Conselho Monetário Nacional) enacted Resolution No. 3,265 that, effective March 14, 2005, consolidated the two foreign exchange markets into one foreign exchange market for the general purpose of making foreign exchange transactions simpler and more efficient. All foreign exchange transactions are now carried out in this single foreign exchange market through financial institutions authorized to operate in the market. Brazilian law provides that, whenever there (i) is a significant imbalance in Brazils balance of payments, or (ii) are major reasons to foresee a significant imbalance in Brazils balance of payments, temporary restrictions may be imposed on remittances of foreign capital abroad. In the past, the Central Bank has intervened occasionally to control unstable movements in foreign exchange rates. We cannot predict whether the Central Bank or the Brazilian government will continue to let the real float freely or will intervene in the exchange rate market through a currency band system or otherwise. The real may depreciate or appreciate against the U.S. dollar and other currencies substantially in the future. Exchange rate fluctuations may affect the U.S. dollar amounts received by the holders of ADSs. We will make any distributions with respect to our preferred shares in reais and the depositary will convert these distributions into U.S. dollars for payment to the holders of ADSs. Exchange rate fluctuations may also affect the U.S. dollar equivalent of the real price of the preferred shares on the Brazilian stock exchange where they are traded. Exchange rate fluctuations may also affect our results of operations. See Risk Factors  Exchange rate instability may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and the market price of the ADSs and our preferred shares. The table below sets forth, for the periods indicated, the low, high, average and period-end noon buying rates for reais, expressed in reais per US$1.00.

Risks Relating to CEMIG We are controlled by the State Government which may have interests that are different from yours. As our controlling shareholder, the government of the State of Minas Gerais exercises substantial influence on the management and orientation of the business of CEMIG. It is not possible to analyze the impact and effects this may have on us or our results of operations. The government of the State of Minas Gerais currently holds approximately 51% of our common shares and, consequently, has the right to the majority of votes in decisions of the General Meetings of our Shareholders, and can (i) elect the majority of the members of the Board of Directors of CEMIG, and (ii) decide matters requiring approval by a specific majority of our shareholders, including transactions with related parties, shareholding reorganizations and the date and payment of any dividends. The operations of CEMIG have had and will continue to have an important impact on the commercial and industrial development of the State of Minas Gerais, and on its social conditions. In the past, the State Government has used, and may use in the future, its status as our controlling shareholder to decide that we should engage in certain activities and make certain investments aimed, principally, to promote its political, economic or social objectives and not necessarily to meet the objective of improving our business and/or operational results. We are subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation. The Brazilian Federal Government has been implementing policies that have a far-reaching impact on the Brazilian power industry and, in particular, the electricity industry. As part of the restructuring of the industry, Federal Law No. 10,848 of March 15, 2004, (Law No. 10,848/04 or the New Industry Model Law) introduced a new regulatory framework for the Brazilian electricity industry. Law No. 10,848/04 and Decree 5,163/04 of July 30, 2004 governing the purchase and sale of electricity under the New Industry Model Law remain subject to the implementation of resolutions by ANEEL. Moreover, the constitutionality of Law No. 10,848/04 is currently being challenged before the Brazilian Supreme Court. The Brazilian Supreme Court has not yet reached a final decision and, therefore, Law No. 10,848/04 is currently in force. If all or a portion of Law No. 10,848/04 is considered to be unconstitutional by the Brazilian Supreme Court, all or a portion of the regulatory scheme introduced by Law No. 10,848/04 may not come into effect, generating uncertainty as to how and when the Federal Government will be able to introduce changes to the electricity industry. Accordingly, we cannot now evaluate the impact of the new regulation to be issued by ANEEL or the impact that a decision on the constitutionality of Law No. 10,848/04 would have on our future activities, results of operations and financial condition. New rules for the sale of electric energy and market conditions may affect our generation sale prices. Under the New Industry Model Law, our generation company must sell our electric energy that was previously sold under self-dealing initial supply contracts between our generating and distribution companies with regulated prices (the Initial Contracts) directly in a regulated market through public auctions conducted by ANEEL or in the Free Contracting Environment (the ACL). We also expect to have additional power capacity from new developments yet to be operational that we are planning to sell under the auctions to be held under the Regulated Contracting Environment (the ACR) or in the ACL as described in this annual report. Legislation allows distributors that contract with our generation company under the ACR to reduce the quantity of energy contracted under these contracts until a certain limit, exposing the generation company to the risk of failing to contract this reduced energy with adequate prices. Contracts in the ACL with consumers allowed to purchase energy directly from generating companies or energy traders (generally consumers with demand equal to or greater than 3 MW, and referred to as Free 9 Consumers) will also give such consumers the flexibility to purchase less energy from us than was originally contracted for by such consumers, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to sell all of our energy capacity in the auctions or in the ACL, we may be forced to sell it at significantly lower prices in the spot market and our revenues and our results of operations may be adversely affected. ANEEL has substantial discretion to establish the rates we charge to captive consumers and the rates we charge to Free Consumers for using our distribution system. Such rates are determined pursuant to concession contracts entered with ANEEL and in accordance with ANEELs regulatory decision-making authority. Concession agreements and Brazilian law establish a price cap mechanism that permits three types of rate adjustments: (1) the annual adjustment; (2) the periodic revision; and (3) the extraordinary revision. We are entitled to apply each year for the annual adjustment, which is designed to offset some of the effects of inflation on rates and pass through to consumers certain changes in our cost structure that are beyond our control, such as the cost of electricity we purchase from certain sources and certain other regulatory charges, including charges for the use of transmission and distribution facilities. In addition, ANEEL carries out a periodic revision every five years that is aimed at identifying variations in our costs as well as setting a factor based on our operational efficiency that will be applied against the index of our ongoing annual rate adjustments, the intended effect of which is to reward the good management of our costs while sharing any related gains with our consumers. We are also entitled to request an extraordinary revision of our rates if unpredictable events significantly alter our cost structure. The periodic revision and extraordinary revision are subject to a certain degree of ANEELs discretion. Although our concession agreement provides that the company must remain in economic and financial balance, we cannot assure you that ANEEL will establish rates that will adequately compensate us and that our revenues and results of operations will not be adversely affected by such rates. In addition, to the extent any of these adjustments are not granted by ANEEL in a timely manner, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. We may not be able to collect the full amount of a significant receivable from the State Government. We have an account receivable from the State Government, referred to as the CRC Account, that totaled R$2,942 million as of December 31, 2004. The agreement between CEMIG and the State Government that governs the CRC Account receivable is referred to as the CRC Account Agreement. Historically we have had difficulty collecting amounts due from the State Government under the CRC Account. On January 23, 2006, CEMIG and the State Government executed a Fourth Amendment to the CRC Account Agreement, under which the State Government agreed to pay its debt in 61 semi-annual payments and irrevocably authorized us to retain 65% of the dividends and interest on capital due to it through June 30, 2035 to offset amounts due under the CRC Account Agreement. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to pay dividends sufficient to allow us to retain dividends due to the State Government in the amount necessary to cover the repayment of the full amount of the principal and interest due under the CRC Account. See Item 10. Additional InformationMaterial ContractsCRC Account Agreement. We are strictly liable for any damages resulting from inadequate rendering of electricity services, and our contracted insurance policies may not fully cover such damages. Under Brazilian law, we are strictly liable for direct and indirect damages resulting from the inadequate rendering of electricity transmission and distribution services. In addition, the damages caused to end consumers as a result of interruptions or disturbances arising from the generation, transmission or distribution systems, whenever these interruptions or disturbances are not attributed to an identifiable member of the Operador Nacional do Sistema (National System Operator, or ONS) or the ONS itself, shall be shared among generation, distribution and transmission companies. Until a final criteria is defined, the liability for such damages shall be shared in the proportion of 35.7% to distribution agents, 28.6% to transmission agents and 35.7% to generation agents. Therefore, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 10 We are subject to rules and limits applied to levels of public sector borrowing and to restrictions on the use of certain funds we raise, which could prevent us from obtaining financing. As a state controlled company, we are subject to rules and limits on the level of credit applicable to the public sector issued by the National Monetary Council and by the Central Bank. These rules set certain parameters and conditions for financial institutions to be able to offer credit to public sector entities. Thus, if our operations do not fall within these parameters and conditions, we may have difficulty in obtaining financing from Brazilian financial institutions, which could create difficulties in the implementation of our investment plan or in refinancing our financial obligations. Brazilian legislation also establishes that a state-controlled company, in general, may only use proceeds of external or local transactions (debt, including bonds) to refinance financial obligations for which there is no other source of repayment. As a result of these regulations, our capacity to incur debt is again limited, and this could negatively affect the implementation of our investment plan or the refinancing of our obligations. There are contractual restrictions on our capacity to incur debt. We are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to incur debt due to covenants set forth in our loan agreements. In the event of our non-compliance with any such covenants in our loan agreements, the total principal, future interest and any penalties due under these agreements may become immediately due and payable. Early maturity of our obligations could adversely affect our financial condition especially in light of cross default provisions in several of our loan and financing contracts. The existence of limitations on our indebtedness could prevent us from borrowing to finance our operations or to refinance our existing obligations which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We could be penalized by ANEEL for failing to comply with the terms of our concession agreements, which could result in fines, other penalties and, depending on the severity of non-compliance, expropriation of the concession agreements. We conduct our generation, transmission and distribution activities pursuant to concession agreements entered into with the Federal Government through ANEEL. ANEEL may impose penalties on us if we fail to comply with any provision of the concession agreements, including compliance with the established quality standards. Depending on the severity of the non-compliance, these penalties could include: · fines per breach of up to 2.0% of the concessionaires revenues in the year ended immediately prior to the date of the relevant breach; · injunctions related to the construction of new facilities and equipment; · restrictions on the operation of existing facilities and equipment; · temporary suspension from participating in bidding processes for new concessions; · intervention by ANEEL in the management of the concessionaire in breach; and · termination of the concession. In addition, the Federal Government has the power to terminate any of our concessions prior to the end of the concession term in the case of bankruptcy or dissolution, or by means of expropriation for reasons related to the public interest. We cannot assure you that ANEEL will not impose penalties or terminate our concessions in the event of a breach. Any compensation we may receive upon the termination of the concession contract may not be sufficient to compensate us for the full value of certain investments. If any of our concession agreements are terminated and we are at fault, the effective amount of compensation could be reduced through fines or other penalties. Termination or imposition of penalties could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 11 We are uncertain as to the renewal of our concessions. We carry out our generation, transmission and distribution activities pursuant to concession agreements entered into with the Federal Government. The Brazilian Constitution requires that all concessions relating to public services be awarded through a bidding process. In 1995, in an effort to implement these constitutional provisions, the Federal Government adopted certain laws and regulations, known collectively as the Concessions Law, governing bidding procedures in the electricity industry. In accordance with the Concessions Law, as modified by the New Industry Model Law, upon application by the concessionaire, existing concessions may be renewed by the Federal Government for additional periods of up to 20 years without being subject to the bidding process, provided that the concessionaire has met minimum performance standards and that the proposal is otherwise acceptable to the Federal Government. In light of the degree of discretion granted to the Federal Government by the Concessions Law with respect to new concession contracts and the renewal of existing concessions, and given the lack of long-standing precedents with respect to the Federal Governments exercise of such discretion and interpretation and application of the Concessions Law, we cannot assure you that new concessions will be obtained or that concessions will be renewed on terms as favorable as those currently in effect.
