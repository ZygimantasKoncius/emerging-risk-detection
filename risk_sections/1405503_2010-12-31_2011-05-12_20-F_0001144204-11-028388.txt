D. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the People’s Republic of China—We may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our operating subsidiary to fund cash and financing requirements, and limitations on the ability of our operating subsidiary to pay dividends to us could materially restrict on our ability to conduct our business.” Holders of ADSs will be entitled to receive dividends, subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, less the fees and expenses payable under the deposit agreement. Cash dividends will be paid by the depositary to holders of ADSs in U.S. dollars. Other distributions, if any, will be paid by the depositary to holders of our ADSs in any means it deems legal, fair and practical. 81 B.
