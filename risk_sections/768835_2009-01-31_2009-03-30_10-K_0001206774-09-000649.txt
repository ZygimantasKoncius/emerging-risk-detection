ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. In addition, these statements constitute cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our disclosure and analysis in this Form 10-K and in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders contain some forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on managements plans and assumptions. From time to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forward-looking statements. Such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, objective, goal, project, intend, plan, believe, will, should, may, target, forecast, guidance, outlook, and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, forward-looking statements include statements relating to future actions, future performance, or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties, and potentially inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated, or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date thereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. 5 Also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relevant to our businesses. There can be no assurances that we have correctly and completely identified, assessed, and accounted for all factors that do or may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we presently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact us. Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that the results or developments we anticipate will be realized or that they will have the expected effects on our business or operations. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. Our ability to achieve the results contemplated by forward-looking statements is subject to a number of factors, any one, or a combination, of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. These factors may include, but are not limited to: The current conditions in the financial markets combined with the current economic conditions (including falling home prices, increased levels of unemployment, foreclosures on mortgages, bankruptcies, and reduced access to credit) are extraordinary and give rise to risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity including, but not limited to the following: Consumers may defer or elect to forego purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news. Reduced consumer spending may reduce our net sales, which could lower our profitability and limit our ability to convert merchandise inventories to cash. Fluctuating commodity prices, including but not limited to diesel fuel and other fuels used to generate power by utilities, may affect our gross profit and operating profit margins. The impact of these conditions on our vendors businesses cannot be predicted. Our vendors may be negatively impacted due to insufficient availability of credit to fund their operations or insufficient demand for their products, which may affect their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. Our expectations regarding the demand for our merchandise may be inaccurate, which could cause us to under buy or over buy certain categories or departments of merchandise, which could result in customer dissatisfaction or excessive markdowns required to sell through the merchandise. The reaction of our competitors to the marketplace, including the emerging trend of liquidations occurring at bankrupt retailers, may drive our competitors, some of whom are better capitalized than us, to offer significant discounts or promotions on their merchandise, which could negatively affect our sales and profit margins. A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital or increase the borrowing rates we pay. A further decline in the market value of our qualified defined benefit pension plans (Pension Plan) investment portfolios may affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Additionally, many of the effects and consequences of the financial crisis and broad economic downturn are currently unknown and beyond our control; any one or all of them could potentially have a material adverse impact on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. If we are unable to continue to successfully execute our operating strategies, our operating performance could be significantly impacted. There is a risk that we will be unable to continue to meet or exceed our operating performance targets and goals in the future if our strategies and initiatives are unsuccessful. In 2008, we were able to meet or exceed many of our operating performance targets and goals that we announced in 2007. When announced, we expected 6 to meet these targets and goals by 2009. As a result of achieving these targets and goals one year early, we developed an updated strategic plan in 2008 that we intend to use as our roadmap for the next three years (see the accompanying MD&A for additional information concerning our operating strategy). The new plan includes a continued focus on merchandising, real estate, and cost structure. If we are unable to compete effectively in the highly competitive discount retail industry, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. The discount retail business is highly competitive. As discussed in Item 1 of this Form 10-K, we compete for customers, employees, products, real estate, and other aspects of our business with a number of other companies. Certain of our competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources that may be devoted to sourcing, promoting, and selling their merchandise. It is possible that increased competition or improved performance by our competitors may reduce our market share, gross margin, operating margin, and projected operating results, and may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in other ways. Further declines in general economic condition, consumer spending levels, and other conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise thereby materially adversely affecting our revenues and gross margin. Our results of operations can be directly impacted by the health of the United States economy. Our business and financial performance may be adversely impacted by current and future economic conditions, including factors that may restrict or otherwise negatively impact consumer financing, disposable income levels, unemployment levels, energy costs, interest rates, recession, inflation, the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, and other matters that influence consumer spending. The economies of four states (Ohio, Texas, California, and Florida) are particularly important as approximately 37% of our current stores operate in these states and 38% of our 2008 net sales occurred in these states. Changes by vendors related to the management of their inventories may reduce the quantity and quality of brand-name closeout merchandise available to us or may increase our cost to acquire brand-name closeout merchandise, either of which may materially adversely affect our revenues and gross margin. The products we sell are sourced from a variety of vendors with approximately half of our merchandise assortment being pre-planned and made according to our specifications and approximately half of our merchandise sourced on a closeout basis. The portion of our assortment that is pre-planned and made according to our specifications consists of imported merchandise (primarily furniture, seasonal, and portions of our home categories along with certain other classifications like toys) or merchandise that is re-orderable upon demand. For the closeout component of our business, we do not control the supply, design, function, availability, or cost of many of the products that we offer for sale. We depend upon the sufficient availability of closeout merchandise that we can acquire and offer at prices that represent a value to our customers, in order to meet or exceed our operating performance targets for gross margin. In addition, we rely on our vendors to provide us with quality merchandise. To the extent that certain of our vendors are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess inventory, the amount of closeout merchandise available to us could be materially reduced. If shortages or disruptions occur in the availability of closeout merchandise or if the quality of such merchandise is not acceptable to our customers or us, it is likely to have a material adverse effect on our sales and gross margin and may result in customer dissatisfaction. We rely on vendors located in foreign countries for significant amounts of merchandise. Additionally, a significant amount of our domestically-purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad. Our business may be materially adversely affected by risks associated with international trade. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in driving higher gross margin. During 2008, we purchased approximately 27% of our products directly from overseas vendors including 21% from vendors located in China. Our ability to find qualified vendors and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outside of the United States. Factors relating to foreign trade that are beyond our control include increased import duties, increased shipping costs, more restrictive quotas, loss of most favored nation trading status, currency and exchange rate fluctuations, 7 work stoppages, transportation delays, economic uncertainties such as inflation, foreign government regulations, political unrest, natural disasters, war, terrorism, trade restrictions (including retaliation by the United States against foreign practices), political instability, the financial stability of vendors, merchandise quality issues, and tariffs. These and other issues affecting our vendors could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance. Our inability to properly manage our inventory levels and offer merchandise that our customers want may materially adversely impact our business and financial performance. We must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully. However, we also must guard against accumulating excess inventory as we seek to maintain appropriate in-stock levels. As stated above, we obtain approximately a quarter of our merchandise from vendors outside of the United States. These foreign vendors often require lengthy advance notice of our requirements in order to be able to supply products in the quantities that we request. This usually requires us to order merchandise and enter into purchase order contracts for the purchase and manufacture of such merchandise well in advance of the time these products are offered for sale. As a result, we may experience difficulty in responding to a changing retail environment, which makes us vulnerable to changes in price and in consumer preferences. In addition, even though the lead time to obtain domestically-sourced merchandise is less, we attempt to maximize our gross margin and operating efficiency by delivering proper quantities of merchandise to our stores in a timely manner. If we do not accurately anticipate future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to replenish inventory levels, our inventory levels may not be appropriate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, including Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance. From time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions, including various collective or class action lawsuits that are brought against us for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and state wage and hour laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we may not be able to accurately determine the impact on us of any future adverse outcome of such proceedings. The ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. In addition, regardless of the outcome, these proceedings could result in substantial cost to us and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. For a description of certain current legal proceedings, see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We may be subject to risks associated with changes in laws, regulations, and accounting standards that may adversely affect our business and financial performance. Changes in governmental regulations and accounting standards, including new interpretations and applications of accounting standards, may have adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. The bankruptcy of our formerly owned KB Toys business may adversely affect our business and financial performance. In December 2000, we sold the KB Toys business to KB Acquisition Corporation. On January 14, 2004, KB Acquisition Corporation and certain affiliated entities (collectively KB-I) filed for bankruptcy protection pursuant to Chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code. On August 30, 2005, in connection with the acquisition by an affiliate of Prentice Capital Management of majority ownership of KB-I, KB-I emerged from their January 14, 2004 bankruptcy (with the new owner of the KB Toys business referred to as KB-II). On December 11, 2008, KB-II filed for bankruptcy protection pursuant to Chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code. Based on information we have received subsequent to the December 11, 2008 bankruptcy filing, we believe we may have indemnification and guarantee obligations (KB-II Bankruptcy Lease Obligations) with respect to 31 KB Toys store leases. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we accrued an estimated liability in the amount of $5.0 million related to KB-II Bankruptcy Lease Obligations. Because of uncertainty inherent in the assumptions used to estimate this liability, our estimated liability could ultimately prove to be understated and could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. For additional information regarding the KB Toys bankruptcies, see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 8 A significant decline in our operating profit and taxable income may impair our ability to realize the value of our long-lived assets and deferred tax assets. We are required by accounting rules to periodically assess our property and equipment and deferred tax assets for realizability and recognize an impairment loss or valuation charge, if necessary. In performing these assessments, we use our historical financial performance to indicate to us whether we have potential impairments or valuation concerns and as evidence to support our assumptions about future financial performance. If our financial performance significantly declines, it could negatively affect the results of our assessments of the recoverability of our property and equipment and our deferred tax assets. This risk is heightened as a result of the current economic conditions; however, we did not recognize a material impairment or valuation allowance upon completing the assessments necessary for the accompanying consolidated financial statements. There is a risk that if our future operating results significantly decline, it could impair our ability to recover the value of our property and equipment and deferred tax assets. Impairment or valuation charges taken against property and equipment and deferred tax assets could be material and could have a material adverse impact on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity (see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of our MD&A for further discussion of our accounting policies for long-lived assets and income taxes). Our inability, if any, to comply with the terms of the 2004 Credit Agreement may have a material adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. We have the ability to borrow funds under the 2004 Credit Agreement and we utilize this ability at various times depending on operating or other cash flow requirements. The 2004 Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on indebtedness, liens, and investments, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios  a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. A violation of these covenants may permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access loans and letters of credit and may require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans. If our financial performance is not in compliance with these covenants, it may have a material adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding beyond the maturity of the 2004 Credit Agreement in October 2009. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and, as necessary, access to the credit markets to fund our seasonal working capital, other capital, and operating expenditures. Specifically, we have used our revolving bank credit facility under the 2004 Credit Agreement to fund peak levels of working capital, which have historically occurred late in our third fiscal quarter or early in our fourth fiscal quarter, and to make other investments in the business for which we expect a future economic benefit. The termination of the 2004 Credit Agreement in October 2009 and the reduced availability and increased costs in the current credit market may impact our current operating and investing strategies. We intend to arrange for a new revolving credit facility to replace the expiring 2004 Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that the credit markets will not deteriorate further which could adversely impact our ability to execute a new credit facility. If we were unable to access the credit markets and secure a new credit facility, we could face business disruptions. Also, costs associated with a new credit facility could increase our costs of funding our operations. If we are unable to maintain or upgrade our information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient. We depend on a variety of information systems for the efficient functioning of our business. We rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business. The software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers. Costs and potential interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of our existing systems could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our business. 9 If we are unable to successfully execute our SAP® for Retail system implementation, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient. In January 2008, we announced our plans to implement SAP® for Retail solutions over the next few years. New financial systems, including general ledger, accounts payable and fixed assets, were under development during 2008 and are planned for continued development and testing in 2009. We expect to place the new financial systems in service in 2010. A new core merchandising system is planned for development in 2009 and development and testing in 2010, with plans to place the new core merchandising system in service in 2011. The implementation of these systems is expected to have a pervasive impact on our information systems and across a significant portion of our general office operations, including merchandising, technology, and finance. If we are unable to successfully implement SAP® for Retail, it may have an adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. If we are unable to retain suitable store locations under favorable lease terms, our financial performance may be negatively affected. We lease almost all of our stores and a significant number of these leases expire or are up for renewal each year. Our strategy to improve our financial performance includes sales growth while managing the occupancy cost of each of our stores. If we are not able to negotiate favorable lease renewals, including the proper determination of which leases to renew, our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity may be negatively affected. If we are unable to secure customer, employee, and company data, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to penalties or lawsuits. The protection of our customer, employee, and company data is critical to us. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements across our business. In addition, our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. A significant breach of customer, employee, or company data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales, fines, and/or lawsuits. If we lose key personnel, it may have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. We believe that we benefit substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives. The loss of services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse impact on our business. Competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit, train, and retain our senior executives and other qualified personnel. The price of our common shares as traded on the New York Stock Exchange may be volatile. Our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, general economic and stock market conditions, risks relating to our business and industry as discussed above, strategic actions by us or our competitors, variations in our quarterly operating performance, our future sales or purchases of our common shares, and investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common shares relative to other investment alternatives. We also may be subject to a number of other factors which may, individually or in the aggregate, materially or adversely affect our business. These factors include, but are not limited to: Events or circumstances could occur which could create bad publicity for us or for types of merchandise offered in our stores which may negatively impact our business results including sales; Infringement of our intellectual property, including the Big Lots trademarks, could dilute our value; Our ability to attract and retain suitable employees; Our ability to establish effective advertising, marketing, and promotional programs; and Other risks described from time to time in our filings with the SEC. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 10 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Retail Operations All of our stores are located in the United States, predominantly in strip shopping centers, and have an average store size of approximately 29,800 square feet, of which an average of 21,400 square feet is selling square feet. The average cost to open a new store in a leased facility during 2008 was approximately $1.0 million, including cost of inventory. Except for 54 owned sites, all of our stores are leased. In 2008, we acquired, for $8.6 million, two store properties we were previously leasing. The 54 owned stores are located in the following states: Stores State Owned Arizona 3 California 39 Colorado 3 Florida 2 Louisiana 1 New Mexico 2 Ohio 1 Texas 3 Total 54 Store leases generally obligate us for fixed monthly rental payments plus the payment, in most cases, of our applicable portion of real estate taxes, common area maintenance costs (CAM), and property insurance. Some leases require the payment of a percentage of sales in addition to minimum rent. Such payments generally are required only when sales exceed a specified level. Our typical store lease is for an initial minimum term of five to 10 years with multiple five-year renewal options. Sixty-one store leases have sales termination clauses which can result in our exiting a location at our option if certain sales volume results are not achieved. The following table summarizes the number of store lease expirations in each of the next five fiscal years and the total thereafter. In addition, as stated above, many of our store leases have renewal options. The table also includes the number of leases that are scheduled to expire each year that do not have a renewal option. The information includes stores with more than one lease and leases for stores not yet open. It excludes 11 month-to-month leases and 54 owned locations. Leases Expiring Without Fiscal Year: Leases Options 2009 247 45 2010 249 45 2011 237 31 2012 182 19 2013 237 31 Thereafter 152 12 Warehouse and Distribution At January 31, 2009, we own or lease approximately 10.2 million square feet of distribution center and warehouse space. We operated five regional closeout distribution centers strategically placed across the United States and a furniture distribution center in California. Our regional closeout distribution centers are owned and located in Ohio, California, Alabama, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania. In addition to these merchandise distribution centers, we own or lease warehouses in Ohio and California that distribute store fixtures and supplies. The regional closeout distribution centers utilize warehouse management technology, which enables high accuracy and efficient processing of merchandise from vendors to our retail stores. The combined output of our merchandise distribution facilities was approximately 2.5 million cartons per week in 2008. Certain vendors deliver merchandise directly to our stores. We attempt to get merchandise from our vendors to the sales floor in the most effective manner. 11 The number of owned and leased warehouse and distribution facilities and the corresponding square footage of the facilities by state at January 31, 2009, were as follows: Square Footage State Owned Leased Total Owned Leased Total (Square footage in thousands) Ohio 1 2 3 3,559 731 4,290 California 1 1 2 1,423 467 1,890 Alabama 1  1 1,411  1,411 Oklahoma 1  1 1,297  1,297 Pennsylvania 1  1 1,295  1,295 Total 5 3 8 8,985 1,198 10,183 Corporate Office We own the facility in Columbus, Ohio that serves as our general office for corporate associates.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Effective August 18, 2006, our common shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol BIG. Prior to the August 18, 2006 change, our symbol on the NYSE was BLI. The following table reflects the high and low sales prices per common share for our common shares as reported on the NYSE composite tape for the fiscal periods indicated: 2008 2007 High Low High Low First Quarter $ 28.65 $ 15.00 $ 34.55 $ 23.43 Second Quarter 34.88 26.03 36.15 24.72 Third Quarter 35.33 18.99 31.98 22.37 Fourth Quarter $ 24.88 $ 12.93 $ 22.95 $ 12.40 Our Board of Directors historically has authorized reinvesting available cash in capital expenditures for various maintenance and growth opportunities and in share repurchase programs. We historically have not paid dividends and our Board of Directors is currently not considering any change in this policy. In the event that we change our policy, any future cash dividend payments would be determined by our Board of Directors taking into account business conditions then existing, including our earnings, financial requirements and condition, opportunities for reinvesting cash, and other factors. On March 9, 2007, we announced our $600.0 million March 2007 Repurchase Program commencing upon authorization by our Board of Directors and continuing until exhausted. On November 30, 2007, we announced our $150.0 million November 2007 Repurchase Program commencing upon the completion of the March 2007 Repurchase Program and continuing until exhausted. On December 3, 2007, we completed the March 2007 Repurchase Program. In the first quarter of 2008, we completed the November 2007 Repurchase Program. Common shares acquired through the repurchase programs are available to meet obligations under equity compensation plans and for general corporate purposes. During 2007, as part of these announced repurchase programs, we purchased 30.0 million common shares having an aggregate cost of $712.5 million with an average price paid per share of $23.76. During 2008, as part of these announced repurchased programs, we purchased 2.2 million common shares having an aggregate cost of $37.5 million with an average price paid per share of $17.28. The repurchased common shares were placed into treasury and are used for general corporate purposes including the issuance of shares related to employee benefit plans. At the close of trading on the NYSE on March 25, 2009, there were approximately 1,100 registered holders of record of our common shares. 14 The following graph and table compares, for the five fiscal year period ended January 31, 2009, the cumulative total shareholder return for our common shares, the S&P 500 Index, and the S&P 500 Retailing Index.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The discussion and analysis presented below should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. Please refer to Item 1A of this Form 10-K for a discussion of forward-looking statements and certain risk factors that may have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which results in some fiscal years with 52 weeks and some with 53 weeks. Fiscal year 2006 was comprised of 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2008 and 2007 each were comprised of 52 weeks. Operating Results Summary The following are the results from 2008 that we believe are key indicators of our operating performance when compared to our operating performance in 2007. Comparable store sales for stores open at least two years at the beginning of 2008 increased 0.5%. Sales per selling square foot were $160 in 2008 and $158 in 2007. Net sales declined 0.2% as we operated an average of 1,356 stores throughout 2008 compared to 1,370 average stores throughout 2007. Gross margin as a percent of sales increased 50 basis points to 40.0% of sales in 2008 from 39.5% of sales in 2007. Gross margin dollars were higher by 0.9%. Average inventory levels were lower throughout 2008 compared to 2007 and, combined with the 0.5% increase in comparable store sales, resulted in a higher inventory turnover rate of 3.6 times in 2008 compared to 3.5 times in 2007. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales increased 30 basis points to 32.8% of sales from 32.5% of sales in 2007. Depreciation expense as a percent of sales decreased 20 basis points to 1.7% of sales in 2008 from 1.9% of sales in 2007. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations improved to $1.89 per share in 2008 compared to $1.47 per share in 2007. Cash provided by operating activities was $211.1 million in 2008 compared to $307.9 million in 2007. Our total inventory per average store was flat at the end of 2008 compared to 2007. Our accounts payable leverage declined at the end of 2008 as a result of a shift in our merchandise mix to higher purchases from vendors which have shorter payment terms, many of whom offer cash discounts. The 2008 decline in our accounts payable leverage compares to the increase in leverage during 2007. Additionally, we paid income taxes of $92.4 million in 2008 compared to $65.8 million in 2007. We acquired 2.2 million of our common shares in 2008 under our publicly-announced repurchase program for a total cost of $37.5 million. 17 The following table compares components of our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales: 2008 2007 2006 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 60.0 60.5 60.1 Gross margin 40.0 39.5 39.9 Selling and administrative expenses 32.8 32.5 34.2 Depreciation expense 1.7 1.9 2.1 Operating profit 5.5 5.1 3.5 Interest expense (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.0 ) Interest and investment income 0.0 0.1 0.1 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 5.4 5.1 3.6 Income tax expense 2.0 1.9 1.2 Income from continuing operations 3.3 3.2 2.4 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax (0.1 ) 0.2 0.2 Net income 3.3 % 3.4 % 2.6 % See the discussion and analysis below for additional details of the specific components of our operating results comparing the 2008 results to 2007 and the 2007 results to 2006. Selling and administrative expenses in 2007 were reduced by $5.2 million (10 basis points), pretax, for proceeds we received from the KB Toys bankruptcy trust (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information) and $4.9 million (10 basis points), pretax, for insurance proceeds we received as recovery for 2005 hurricane insurance claims. In 2006, we reached tentative settlements of two employment-related civil class actions brought against us. We recorded, in 2006, pretax charges of $9.7 million (20 basis points) included in selling and administrative expenses for the estimated settlement liability for these matters. See note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional detail on these matters. In 2006, we recorded pretax income of $2.6 million (less than 10 basis points) in selling and administrative expenses upon receipt of our portion of the Visa/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement funds that compensate merchants for the excessive fees paid for certain Visa and MasterCard transactions. Seasonality As discussed in Item 1. Business, under the Seasonality caption, our financial results fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on various factors such as timing of new or closed stores, timing and extent of advertisements and promotions, and timing of holidays. We expect that the Christmas holiday selling season will continue to result in a significant portion of our sales and operating profits. If our sales performance is significantly better or worse during this time frame, we would expect a more pronounced impact on our annual financial results. The following table sets forth the seasonality of net sales and operating profit for 2008 and 2007 by fiscal quarter: First Second Third Fourth Fiscal Year 2008 Net sales percentage of full year 24.8 % 23.8 % 22.0 % 29.4 % Operating profit as a percentage of full year 22.8 17.1 7.9 52.2 Fiscal Year 2007 Net sales percentage of full year 24.2 % 23.3 % 22.1 % 30.4 % Operating profit as a percentage of full year 18.0 14.1 9.6 58.3 18 Operating Strategy In August 2005, we introduced our operating strategy called the Whats Important Now Strategy (WIN Strategy). The WIN Strategy is comprised of three distinct elements: merchandising, real estate, and cost structure. Over the last three years, our strategy has followed a roadmap focused on expanding our operating profit rate (which increased from 0.6% in 2005 to 5.5% in 2008), driving growth in earnings per share from continuing operations (which increased from $0.14 per diluted share in 2005 to $1.89 per diluted share in 2008), and generating significant cash provided by operating activities to reinvest in the business or to return to shareholders ($900 million in aggregate share repurchases in 2006, 2007 and 2008 under publicly announced share repurchase programs). In 2009, we expect our 1) operating profit rate to be flat to down 30 basis points based on our projections that comparable store sales will be flat to down 2% and the gross margin rate will be similar to 2008, 2) earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be $1.75 to $1.90, and 3) cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures of approximately $80 to $85 million to be approximately $145 million. The following sections provide additional discussion and analysis of our WIN Strategy with respect to merchandising, real estate, and cost structure. The 2008 Compared To 2007 section below provides additional discussion and analysis of the impact of these strategies on our financial performance and the assumptions and expectations upon which we are basing our guidance for our future results. Merchandising We developed our merchandise strategy with the goals of growing sales per selling square foot (which increased from $146 per square foot in 2005 to $160 per square foot in 2008) and increasing gross margin dollars (which increased from $1,731.7 million in 2005 to $1,857.4 million in 2008). Our customer surveys have confirmed that brand name merchandise at extreme value, the treasure hunt experience, price, value, and savings are most important to our customers. The treasure hunt experience is how our customers refer to the experience of shopping our stores looking for their favorite brands of merchandise at great values as our assortment of branded merchandise continually changes based on the availability of closeout merchandise. In 2006, we refined our detailed merchandising plans to improve the understanding of each of our merchants regarding his or her targeted levels of 1) closeout merchandise, 2) engineered closeout merchandise (items that we develop along with our vendors), and 3) merchandise categories that we consistently stock. Our objective is to maximize the amount of closeout merchandise which we believe provides the greatest value to our customers. We have communicated many of these expectations to our vendors so that they understand our expectations and work with us to offer the desired types and quantities of merchandise in our stores. We constantly evaluate our mix of closeout merchandise and merchandise that we consistently stock. Our future net sales results could fluctuate materially depending on the availability, timing, and/or size of closeout deals. One of the key elements to the success of our merchandising strategy over the past few years has been to offer our customers better quality merchandise, better values, and more prominent brand name products. This strategy involved offering a merchandise mix to the customer that included items with slightly higher average item retail sales price. One method used to accomplish this was to offer larger package or quantity sizes. For example, instead of offering an item for sale on a per piece basis, we offered the same product in a package of multiple pieces. Another part of the strategy involved offering merchandise with higher average item retails, based on our belief that as long as the value proposition is compelling, our customers are willing to purchase higher ticket merchandise from us. Based on our customer surveys, our customers want higher quality merchandise, which often results in higher average item retail. This strategy has resulted in fewer cartons processed by our distribution centers and stores and achieved positive comparable store sales. From a merchandising perspective in 2009, our goal is to continue to provide unmatched value, better quality, and continue to increase the recognized brand name merchandise as a percentage of the overall merchandise assortment. Because of our long-standing relationships with our vendor partners, we anticipate brand name closeout merchandise deals will continue to be available to us to purchase at savings that we can pass on to our customers. In 2009, we expect our major merchandise categories will remain the same as prior years but the percentage of business by category may fluctuate from time to time based on customer demand and the availability of compelling deals that we are able to source and offer in our stores. 19 Our marketing efforts involve a mix of printed circulars, in-store marketing, television, and online advertising. Many of the products we offer in our circulars are a result of the merchandising strategies discussed above. The planning and coordination that goes into these circulars improves their effectiveness and helps to drive sales, gross margin dollars, and the inventory turnover rate. Much of our marketing is based on information that we have learned about our customers, principally through customer surveys. Based on this information, we believe over 80% of our customers come to our stores without a shopping list or without a specific item or brand in mind to buy. Value dominates top of mind awareness as our customers look to us for savings. Almost one half of our customers surveyed said their shopping trips last over 30 minutes, which we interpret as them coming to shop our stores for the treasure hunt. We have improved, and expect to continue to develop, our in-store signage and merchandising displays and arrangements. Lastly, we continue to market to our Buzz Club, by offering a free online membership and alerting them to new merchandise and offerings in our stores. From a marketing perspective in 2009, we plan to increase the focus on our messages of value and savings available to customers who shop our stores. Our new in-store signage, print, and television advertising will emphasize these messages. The marketing efforts and in-store presentation will focus on merchandise categories that we believe our customers are most interested in, such as Consumables and Hardlines, and that offer particularly great value to the customer. From a store operations perspective, we have initiated a Ready for Business program, which is aimed at improving our net sales by focusing on the consistency and timeliness of in-store merchandising execution and generally improving customer service. The program also focuses on improvements in our employee training programs and hiring practices, and implementation of our merchandising strategies including presentation of merchandise in our stores. We believe that improvements made in these areas of our stores will result in a better shopping experience for our customers and, in turn, may result in higher net sales for us. Real Estate In 2006, we slowed our rate of new store openings based on our recent new store performance and the belief that the real estate locations available to us in the marketplace were too expensive and as such the return on investment would not be satisfactory to our shareholders. During 2006 through 2008, we opened a total of only 39 new stores (11 in 2006, 7 in 2007, and 21 in 2008). During the same timeframe, we closed 101 existing stores (37 in 2006, 29 in 2007, and 35 in 2008) for various reasons including lack of profitability, proposed new lease terms where rents were escalating and landlords were unwilling to renegotiate terms, or relocating the store to a better or potentially more productive location. Throughout 2008, economic conditions in the United States deteriorated leading many retailers to close significant numbers of stores that were similar in size to our stores and were located in markets of interest to us. Many of these same retailers have scaled back planned future capital expenditures, including their future store opening plans. These developments, along with other economic factors, have led to real estate opportunities at favorable lease rates, the availability of higher quality locations, and the availability of more locations. As a result of improvements in our store productivity and overall profitability over the last three years and the softening of the real estate market, we expect to grow our store base in 2009 for the first time in the last five years. We plan to open 45 new stores and close approximately 40 stores in 2009. The openings are expected to be throughout the country with the largest concentration of new stores in the Northeast, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, California, Oregon, and Washington. These markets have historically been some of the more difficult areas to find store leases in our price range. Additionally, in 2009 we plan to test a smaller (approximately 20,000 gross square feet) store to better understand the impact that carrying an edited assortment of merchandise in a smaller store has on sales productivity and profitability. We believe there are a number of store locations available to us in this size range. If successful, a smaller store could represent additional growth opportunities for us over the long term. We expect to test the small store concept during 2009 before making any determination about future inclusion of this store concept in our long term strategy. We believe we have opportunities with respect to the lease options included in our existing store leases. As stated in
