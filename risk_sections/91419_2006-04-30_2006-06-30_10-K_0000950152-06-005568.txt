Item 1A. Risk Factors The Companys business, operations, and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The risk factors described below should be carefully considered, together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the Companys other filings with the SEC, in connection with evaluating the Company, its business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Report. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial also may affect the Company. The occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a material adverse impact on the Companys business, financial condition, and results of operations.  The Company operates in the competitive food industry and relies on continued demand for the Companys products. The Company faces competition across its product lines from other food companies with the primary methods and factors in competition being product quality, price, packaging, new product introductions, nutritional value, convenience, customer service, advertising, and promotion. In order to generate future revenues and profits, the Company must continue to sell products that appeal to the Companys customers and consumers. Specifically, there are a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact the Company and the food industry as a whole including convenience, consumer dietary trends, and obesity, health and nutritional concerns. Continued success is dependent on product innovation, the ability to secure and maintain adequate retail shelf space, and effective trade merchandising, advertising, and marketing programs. Some of the Companys competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources, and competition with them in the Companys various markets and product lines could cause the Company to reduce prices, increase marketing or other expenditures, or lose category share. Category share and growth could be adversely impacted if the Company is not successful in introducing new products.  The Companys operations are subject to the general risks of the food industry. The food industry is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination, product tampering, product recall, and consumer product liability claims. The Companys operations could be impacted by both genuine and fictitious claims regarding the Companys products. In the event of product contamination or tampering, the Company may need to recall some of its products. A widespread product recall could result in significant loss due to the cost of conducting a product recall including destruction of inventory and the loss of sales resulting from the unavailability of product for a period of time. The Company could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against it. Either a significant product recall, or a product liability judgment could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in the Companys food products and an actual or perceived loss of value of the Companys brands, materially impacting consumer demand. 5 Table of Contents  Impairment in the carrying value of acquired goodwill or other intangible assets could negatively affect the Companys consolidated operating results and net worth. A significant portion of the Companys assets is goodwill and other intangible assets, the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. If the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current fair value, the asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value resulting in a noncash charge to earnings. Events and conditions that could result in impairment include increased competition or loss of market share, product innovation or obsolescence, or product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life. At April 30, 2006, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $1.4 billion, compared to total assets of approximately $2.6 billion and total shareholders equity of approximately $1.7 billion.  The Company may not achieve its targeted cost savings from the Companys manufacturing, distribution network, supply chain, and other cost reduction initiatives. The Companys success depends in part on its ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry. The Company has invested extensively in initiatives to optimize production capacity, improve productivity and operating efficiencies, and improve the Companys overall cost base as well as service levels in support of its long-term strategy to own and market leading North American icon brands sold in the center of the store. Ongoing operational issues or unanticipated costs are a possibility when carrying out major initiatives that may result in an adverse impact on future operations or the inability of the Company to achieve its planned cost savings.  The results of the Company may be adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials, including agricultural commodities and fuel. The Company utilizes many different commodities and agricultural products in the manufacturing of its products including peanuts, corn sweeteners, edible oils, sugar, fruit, wheat, and cocoa. In addition, natural gas and fuel oil are necessary components of the manufacturing process, packaging, and distribution of the Companys products. These commodities and agricultural products are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations, the quality and availability of supply, weather, currency fluctuations, speculative influences, trade agreements, political unrest, consumer demand, and changes in governmental agricultural programs. Although the Company utilizes forward contracts and commodity futures contracts to hedge commodity prices in some instances, commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in the Companys raw material and energy costs. The Company may be limited in its ability to pass these cost increases on in the form of price increases or may incur a loss in sales volume to the extent pricing increases are taken.  The Company may be unable to maintain or improve its profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment. In addition, the loss of the Companys largest customer could negatively impact its sales and profits. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately 18 percent of the Companys net sales in 2006. These sales are primarily included in the U.S. retail market segment. Trade receivables at April 30, 2006, included amounts due from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries of $22,087,000. During 2006, the Companys top ten customers, collectively, accounted for approximately 49 percent of consolidated net sales. The bankruptcy or loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact the Companys operations. 6 Table of Contents  Changes in tax, environmental, or other regulations and laws or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade, and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition. The Companys operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, as well as similar and other authorities of Canada, various state, provincial and local governments, and voluntary regulatory and trade associations. The manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of food products is subject to governmental regulation that is increasingly extensive encompassing such matters as ingredients, advertising, relations with distributors and retailers, health, safety, and the environment. Additionally, the Company is routinely subject to new or modified tax and securities regulations, other laws and regulation, and accounting and reporting standards. The Companys failure or inability to comply with these requirements could subject the Company to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions.  The results of the Company may be adversely impacted as a result of changes in defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan factors or regulations. The Company has defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its U.S. and Canadian employees. In addition to the defined benefit pension plans, the Company sponsors several unfunded, defined postretirement plans. The Companys recorded obligations, and expense associated with these plans is recorded in the Companys financial statements based on assumptions related to inflation, investment returns, mortality, employee turnover, rate of compensation increases, medical costs, and discount rates. Changes in any of these assumptions, as well as changes in regulations governing these plans, can cause volatility in recorded assets, liabilities, expense, and future funding requirements.  The Companys operations are subject to the general risks associated with acquisitions. The Companys stated long-term strategy is to own and market leading North American icon brands sold in the center of the store. The Company has historically made strategic acquisitions of brands and businesses and will continue to do so in the future in support of this strategy. The success of past and future acquisitions is dependent on the Companys ability to successfully integrate acquired and existing operations. If the Company is unable to integrate acquisitions successfully, its financial results could suffer. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions are the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns, additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, disputes with sellers, and the inherent risk associated with the Company entering a line of business in which it has no prior experience.
