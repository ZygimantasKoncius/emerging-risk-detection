Item 1A, Risk Factors, and is performed by XTO Energy. As a result, XTO Energy has developed internal policies and controls for estimating and recording reserves. XTO Energys policies regarding booking reserves require proved reserves to be in compliance with the SEC definitions and guidance. XTO Energys policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to its reserve engineering group and require that reserve estimates be made by qualified reserves estimators, as defined by the Society of Petroleum Engineers standards. All qualified reserves estimators are required to receive education covering the fundamentals of SEC proved reserves assignments. The XTO Energy reserve engineering group reviews reserve estimates with our third-party petroleum consultants, Miller and Lents, Ltd., independent petroleum engineers. Miller and Lents, Ltd. estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to the underlying properties as of December 31, 2013, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Miller and Lents primary technical person responsible for calculating the trusts reserves has more than 30 years of experience as a reserve engineer. The estimated reserves for the underlying properties are then used by XTO Energy to calculate the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to the net profits interests. Numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating reserve volumes and values, and such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available. The reserves actually recovered and the timing of production of these reserves may be substantially different from the original estimates. 12 Table of Contents Reserve quantities and revenues for the net profits interests were estimated from projections of reserves and revenues attributable to the combined interests of the trust and XTO Energy in the subject properties. Since the trust has defined net profits interests, the trust does not own a specific percentage of the oil and gas reserve quantities. Accordingly, reserves allocated to the trust pertaining to its 80% net profits interests in the properties have effectively been reduced to reflect recovery of the trusts 80% portion of applicable production and development costs. Because trust reserve quantities are determined using an allocation formula, any fluctuations in actual or assumed prices or costs will result in revisions to the estimated reserve quantities allocated to the net profits interests. Oil and Natural Gas Production Trust production is recognized in the period net profits income is received, which is the month following receipt by XTO Energy, and generally two months after the time of production. Oil and gas production and average sales prices attributable to the underlying properties and the net profits interests for each of the three years ended December 31 were as follows: 2013 2012 2011 Production Underlying Properties Gas  Sales (Mcf) 18,712,650 20,370,975 21,693,139 Average per day (Mcf) 51,268 55,658 59,433 Oil  Sales (Bbls) 216,634 228,656 248,739 Average per day (Bbls) 594 625 681 Net Profits Interests Gas  Sales (Mcf) 7,770,148 5,991,964 10,661,323 Average per day (Mcf) 21,288 16,371 29,209 Oil  Sales (Bbls) 99,363 76,049 130,109 Average per day (Bbls) 272 208 356 Average Sales Price Gas (per Mcf) $ 4.03 $ 3.28 $ 4.73 Oil (per Bbl) $95.25 $91.30 $90.07 Oil and gas production by conveyance attributable to the underlying properties for each of the three years ended December 31 were as follows: Underlying Gas Production (Mcf) Conveyance 2013 2012 2011 Kansas 1,606,436 1,805,789 2,007,032 Oklahoma 12,041,983 12,992,317 13,858,590 Wyoming 5,064,231 5,572,869 5,827,517 Total 18,712,650 20,370,975 21,693,139 Underlying Oil Production (Bbls) Conveyance 2013 2012 2011 Kansas 9,427 14,090 20,682 Oklahoma 196,345 204,022 216,287 Wyoming 10,862 10,544 11,770 Total 216,634 228,656 248,739 Pricing and Sales Information A subsidiary of XTO Energy purchases most of XTO Energys natural gas production based on a weighted average sales price, then sells the gas to third parties for the best available price. Oil production is generally marketed at the wellhead to third parties at the best available price. XTO Energy arranges for some of its natural gas to be processed by unaffiliated third parties and markets the natural gas liquids. Most of the natural gas attributable to the underlying properties is marketed under contracts existing at trust 13 Table of Contents inception. Contracts covering production from the Ringwood area of the Major County area are generally for the life of the lease, and the contract for the majority of production from the Hugoton area was extended through 2014. If new contracts are entered with unaffiliated third parties, the proceeds from sales under those new contracts will be included in gross proceeds from the underlying properties. If new contracts are entered with XTO Energys marketing subsidiary, it may charge XTO Energy a fee that may not exceed 2% of the sales price of the oil and natural gas received from unaffiliated parties. The sales price is net of any deductions for transportation from the wellhead to the unaffiliated parties and any gravity or quality adjustments. For further information on these arrangements see Significant Properties above. Regulation Natural Gas Regulation The interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including transportation and storage rates charged, tariffs, and various other matters, by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Federal price controls on wellhead sales of domestic natural gas terminated on January 1, 1993. While natural gas prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of natural gas regulation. On August 8, 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act, among other things, amended the Natural Gas Act to prohibit market manipulation by any entity, to direct FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce, and to significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder. FERC has promulgated regulations to implement the Energy Policy Act, including enforcement rules and new annual reporting requirements for certain sellers of natural gas. It is impossible to predict whether new legislation to regulate natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, such proposals might have on the operations of the underlying properties. Federal Regulation of Oil Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. The net price received from the sale of these products is affected by market transportation costs. Under rules adopted by FERC effective January 1995, interstate oil pipelines can change rates based on an inflation index, though other rate mechanisms may be used in specific circumstances. On December 19, 2007, the President signed into law the Energy Independence & Security Act of 2007 (PL 110-140). The EISA, among other things, prohibits market manipulation by any person in connection with the purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale in contravention of such rules and regulations that the Federal Trade Commission may prescribe, directs the Federal Trade Commission to enforce the regulations, and establishes penalties for violations thereunder. XTO Energy has advised the trustee that it cannot predict the impact of future government regulation on any crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids facilities, sales or transportation transactions. Environmental Regulation Companies that are engaged in the oil and gas industry are affected by federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. Those laws may impact operations of the underlying properties. No material expenses have been incurred on the underlying properties in complying with environmental laws and regulations. XTO Energy does not expect that future compliance will have a material adverse effect on the trust. There is an increased focus by local, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change. Several states have adopted climate change legislation and regulations, and various other regulatory bodies have announced their intent to regulate GHG emissions or adopt climate change regulations. As these regulations are under development, XTO Energy is unable to predict the total impact of the potential regulations upon the operators of the underlying properties, and it is possible that operators of the underlying properties could face increases in operating costs in order to comply with climate change or GHG emissions legislation, which costs could reduce net proceeds payable to the trust and trust distributions. State Regulation The various states regulate the production and sale of oil and natural gas, including imposing requirements for obtaining drilling permits, the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and gas 14 Table of Contents resources. The rates of production may be regulated and the maximum daily production allowables from both oil and gas wells may be established on a market demand or conservation basis, or both. Federal Income Taxes For federal income tax purposes, the trust constitutes a fixed investment trust that is taxed as a grantor trust. A grantor trust is not subject to tax at the trust level. The unitholders are considered to own the trusts income and principal as though no trust were in existence. The income of the trust is deemed to have been received or accrued by each unitholder at the time such income is received or accrued by the trust and not when distributed by the trust. Because the trust is a grantor trust for federal tax purposes, each unitholder is taxed directly on his proportionate share of income, deductions and credits of the trust consistent with each such unitholders taxable year and method of accounting and without regard to the taxable year or method of accounting employed by the trust. The income of the trust consists primarily of a specified share of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas produced from the underlying properties. During 2013, the trust incurred administration expenses and earned interest income on funds held for distribution and for the cash reserve maintained for the payment of contingent and future obligations of the trust. In addition, the trust received proceeds attributable to the sale of certain properties underlying the Oklahoma net profits interests. (For further information on the property sale, see Trustees Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under Item 7.) The net profits interests constitute economic interests in oil and gas properties for federal tax purposes. Each unitholder is entitled to amortize the cost of the units through cost depletion over the life of the net profits interests or, if greater, through percentage depletion equal to 15 percent of gross income. Unlike cost depletion, percentage depletion is not limited to a unitholders depletable tax basis in the units. Rather, a unitholder is entitled to a percentage depletion deduction as long as the applicable underlying properties generate gross income. Unitholders may compute both percentage depletion and cost depletion from each property and claim the larger amount as a deduction on their income tax returns. If a taxpayer disposes of any Section 1254 property (certain oil, gas, geothermal or other mineral property), and the adjusted basis of such property includes adjustments for depletion deductions under Section 611 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), the taxpayer generally must recapture the amount deducted for depletion as ordinary income (to the extent of gain realized on the disposition of the property). This depletion recapture rule applies to any disposition of property that was placed in service by the taxpayer after December 31, 1986. Detailed rules set forth in Sections 1.1254-1 through 1.1254-6 of the U.S. Treasury Regulations govern dispositions of property after March 13, 1995. The Internal Revenue Service likely will take the position that a unitholder must recapture depletion upon the disposition of a unit. Interest and net profits income attributable to ownership of units and any gain on the sale thereof are considered portfolio income, and not income from a passive activity, to the extent a unitholder acquires and holds units as an investment and not in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Therefore, interest and net profits income attributable to ownership of units generally may not be offset by losses from any passive activities. Under current law, the highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to ordinary income of individuals is 39.6%, and the highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to long-term capital gains (generally, gains from the sale or exchange of certain investment assets held for more than one year) and qualified dividends of individuals is 20%. Such marginal tax rates may be effectively increased by up to 1.2% due to the phaseout of personal exemptions and the limitations on itemized deductions. The highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to corporations is 35%, and such rate applies to both ordinary income and capital gains. Section 1411 of the Code imposes a 3.8% Medicare tax on certain investment income earned by individuals, estates, and trusts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012. For these purposes, investment income generally will include a unitholders allocable share of the trusts interest and royalty income plus the gain recognized from a sale of trust units. In the case of an individual, the tax is imposed on the lesser of (i) the individuals net investment income from all investments, or (ii) the amount by which the individuals modified adjusted gross income exceeds specified threshold levels depending on such individuals federal income tax filing status. In the case of an estate or trust, the tax is imposed on the lesser of (i) undistributed net investment income, 15 Table of Contents or (ii) the excess adjusted gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest income tax bracket applicable to an estate or trust begins. Pending the outcome of arbitration proceedings between the trust and XTO, the trust may be required to bear a portion of the legal settlement costs arising from the Fankhouser settlement (discussed in Item 3  Legal Proceedings). In the event that the trust is determined to be responsible for such costs, XTO will deduct the costs in its calculation of the net profits income payable to the trust from the applicable net profits interests. Thus, for unitholders, the legal settlement costs will be reflected through a reduction in net profits income received from the trust and in a reduction in the gross royalty income reported by and taxable to the unitholders. In addition to the potential settlement costs, the trustee has also incurred legal fees in representing the trusts interests in the ongoing arbitration and other pending litigation matters also discussed in Item 3  Legal Proceedings. For unitholders, such costs will be reflected through an increase in the trusts administrative expenses, which are deductible by unitholders in determining the net royalty income from the trust. The difference between the per-unit taxable income for any period and the per-unit cash distributions, if any, reported for such period is attributable to (i) items that are not currently deductible, such as an increase in the cash reserve maintained by the trust for the payment of future expenditures, (ii) the current deduction of expenses that are paid with amounts previously reserved and (iii) items that do not constitute taxable income, such as a decrease in the cash reserve maintained by the trust and/or a return of capital. In 2012 and 2013, the trustee has elected to reserve amounts from monthly distributions in anticipation of legal fees related to current and anticipated litigation (see discussion in Item 3  Legal Proceedings), so the taxable income per period has frequently differed from the actual amount distributed to unitholders. Individuals may also incur expenses in connection with the acquisition or maintenance of trust units. These expenses, which are different from a unitholders share of the trusts administrative expenses discussed above, may be deductible as miscellaneous itemized deductions only to the extent that such expenses exceed 2 percent of the individuals gross income. Pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (commonly referred to as FATCA), distributions from the trust to foreign financial institutions and certain other non-financial foreign entities may be subject to U.S. withholding taxes. Specifically, certain withholdable payments (including certain royalties, interest and other gains or income from U.S. sources) made to a foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity will generally be subject to the withholding tax unless the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity complies with certain information reporting, withholding, identification, certification and related requirements imposed by FATCA. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. The Treasury Department recently issued guidance providing that the FATCA withholding rules described above generally will only apply to qualifying payments made after June 30, 2014. Foreign unitholders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of these withholding provisions on their investment in trust units. Some trust units are held by middlemen, as such term is broadly defined in U.S. Treasury Regulations (and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners, and brokers holding an interest for a customer in street name, collectively referred to herein as middlemen). Therefore, the trustee considers the trust to be a non-mortgage widely held fixed investment trust (WHFIT) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management, EIN: 56-0906609, Post Office Box 830650, Dallas, Texas, 75283-0650, telephone number 1-877-228-5083, email address trustee1@hugotontrust.com, is the representative of the trust that will provide tax information in accordance with applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the trust as a WHFIT. Tax information is also posted by the trustee at www.hugotontrust.com. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the middlemen holding trust units on behalf of unitholders, and not the trustee of the trust, are solely responsible for complying with the information reporting requirements under the U.S. Treasury Regulations with respect to such trust units, including the issuance of IRS Forms 1099 and certain written tax statements. Unitholders whose trust units are held by middlemen should consult with such middlemen regarding the information that will be reported to them by the middlemen with respect to the trust units. Unitholders should consult their tax advisors regarding trust tax compliance matters. 16 Table of Contents State Income Taxes All revenues from the trust are from sources within Kansas, Oklahoma or Wyoming. Kansas and Oklahoma each impose a state income tax, which is potentially applicable to income from the net profits interests located in each of those states. Because it distributes all of its net income to unitholders, the trust has not been taxed at the trust level in Kansas or Oklahoma. While the trust has not owed tax, the trustee is required to file a return with Kansas and Oklahoma reflecting the income and deductions of the trust attributable to properties located in each state, along with a schedule that includes information regarding distributions to unitholders. Oklahoma taxes the income of nonresidents from real property located within the state, and the trust has been advised by counsel that Oklahoma will tax nonresidents on income from the net profits interest located within the state. Kansas also taxes the income of nonresidents from property located within the state. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2012, Kansas allows individuals to deduct certain amounts, including net income from royalties reported on schedule E of their Form 1040 federal individual income tax return, from their federal adjusted gross income when calculating their Kansas taxable income. This deduction applies to amounts reported as royalty income that are received from grantor trusts, such as the trust. Kansas and Oklahoma also impose a corporate income tax that may apply to unitholders organized as corporations (subject to certain exceptions for S corporations and limited liability companies, depending on their treatment for federal tax purposes). Wyoming does not have a state income tax. Each unitholder should consult his or her own tax advisor regarding state income tax requirements, if any, applicable to such persons ownership of trust units. State Tax Withholding Several states have enacted legislation requiring state income tax withholding from nonresident recipients of oil and gas proceeds. After consultation with its tax counsel, the trustee believes that it is not required to withhold on payments made to the unitholders. However, regulations are subject to change by the various states, which could change this conclusion. Should amounts be withheld on payments made to the trust or the unitholders, distributions to the unitholders would be reduced by the required amount, subject to the filing of a claim for refund by the trust or unitholders for such amount. Other Regulation The Minerals Management Service of the United States Department of the Interior amended the crude oil valuation regulations in July 2004 and the natural gas valuation regulations in June 2005 for oil and natural gas produced from federal oil and natural gas leases. The principal effect of the oil regulations pertains to which published market prices are most appropriate to value crude oil not sold in an arms-length transaction and what transportation deductions should be allowed. The principal effect of the natural gas valuation regulations pertains to the calculation of transportation deductions and changes necessitated by judicial decisions since the regulations were last amended. Seven percent of the net acres of the underlying properties, primarily located in Wyoming, involve federal leases. Neither of these changes have had a significant effect on trust distributions. The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws, including, but not limited to, regulations and laws relating to environmental protection, occupational safety, resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. XTO Energy has advised the trustee that it does not believe that compliance with these laws will have any material adverse effect upon the unitholders. Item 3. Legal Proceedings An amended petition for a class action lawsuit, Beer, et al. v. XTO Energy Inc., was filed in January 2006 in the District Court of Texas County, Oklahoma by certain royalty owners of natural gas wells in Oklahoma and Kansas. The plaintiffs allege that XTO Energy has not properly accounted to the plaintiffs for the royalties to which they are entitled and seek an accounting regarding the natural gas and other products produced from their wells and the prices paid for the natural gas and other products produced, and for payment of the monies allegedly owed since June 2002, with a certain limited number of plaintiffs claiming monies owed for additional time. XTO Energy removed the case to federal district court in Oklahoma City. In April 2010, new counsel and representative parties, Fankhouser and Goddard, filed a motion to intervene and prosecute the Beer class, now styled Fankhouser v. 17 Table of Contents XTO Energy Inc. This motion was granted on July 13, 2010. The new plaintiffs and counsel filed an amended complaint asserting new causes of action for breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment. On December 16, 2010, the court certified the class. Cross motions for summary judgment were filed by the parties and ruled on by the court. XTO Energy has informed the trustee that after consideration of the rulings by the court in March and April of 2012, some benefiting XTO Energy and some benefiting the plaintiffs, and with due regard to the vagaries of litigation and their uncertain outcomes, XTO Energy and the plaintiffs entered into settlement negotiations prior to trial and reached a tentative settlement of $37 million on April 23, 2012. XTO has advised the trustee that $1.4 million of the settlement is attributable to Kansas claims which predate the Trust and therefore XTO Energy will not charge to the Trust. The settlement also includes a new royalty calculation for future royalty payments. A fairness hearing was conducted on October 10, 2012 and the settlement was given final approval by the court. The courts order sets out the amount of attorneys fees and costs awarded to the plaintiffs counsel from the $37 million settlement. A third party administrator will make the distribution to the royalty owners as set out in the order approving the settlement. XTO Energy has advised the trustee it believes that the terms of the conveyances covering the trusts net profits interests require the trust to bear its 80% interest in the settlement, or approximately $28.5 million, of which $23.4 million will affect the net proceeds from Oklahoma and $5.1 million will affect the net proceeds from Kansas. If so, this will adversely affect the net proceeds of the trust from Oklahoma and Kansas and will result in costs exceeding revenues on these properties. XTO Energy began deducting the settlement amount with the September 2012 distribution. Based on the revised settlement allocation between Oklahoma and Kansas and recent revenue and expense levels, the deductions XTO Energy has made, and will resume making if the Tribunal (as defined below) ultimately rules in XTO Energys favor, will cause costs to exceed revenues for approximately 12 months on properties underlying the Oklahoma net profits interests and by approximately 5 years on properties underlying the Kansas net profits interests; however, changes in oil or natural gas prices or expenses could cause the time period to increase or decrease correspondingly. Excess costs must be recovered, with accrued interest, from the future net proceeds of that conveyance and cannot reduce net proceeds from other conveyances. The net profits interest from Wyoming is unaffected and payments will continue to be made from those properties to the extent revenues exceed costs on such properties. XTO Energy has advised the trustee that the settlement would decrease the amount of net profits going forward for the Oklahoma and Kansas properties due to changes in the way costs (such as gathering, compression and fuel) associated with operating the properties will be allocated, resulting in a net gain to the royalty interest owners. XTO Energy has advised the trustee that this expected net upward revision for the royalty interest owners would reduce applicable net profits to XTO Energy and, correspondingly, to the trust. As of December 31, 2013, the revision would have reduced trust net proceeds by approximately $842,000 (this amount would have been reflected in the June 2012 through December 2013 distributions). The trustee has advised XTO Energy that all or a portion of the settlement amount should not be deducted from trust revenues. The trustee further advised XTO that, notwithstanding the Fankhouser settlement, XTO should make no change in the manner in which it calculates payments to the trust on a go-forward basis. XTO Energy does not agree with the trustees position, and to resolve this disagreement XTO Energy initiated binding arbitration on August 1, 2012 in accordance with the terms of the dispute resolution provisions of the Trust Indenture. All issues in the arbitration will be decided by a panel of three arbitrators (the Tribunal). Each side selected one arbitrator and the third arbitrator was selected by the other two appointed arbitrators. The arbitration is being administered by the American Arbitration Association under its commercial rules. The arbitration hearing was held as scheduled on November 12 through November 14, 2013 in Fort Worth, Texas. The Tribunal is expected to issue a decision on or before April 21, 2014. Because XTO Energy advised the trustee that it began deducting the settlement in September 2012, the trustee reserved a total of $900,000 from trust distributions to help fund potential legal and other expenses relating to the arbitration. The trustee believed that without such a reserve, the trust was likely to be left without adequate resources to fund the costs of the arbitration out of monthly trust revenues. As of September 30, 2013, the reserve had been fully depleted in connection with such expenses. Any additional expenses related to this arbitration will be deducted as administrative expense when incurred, however a future reserve may be established to accommodate payment of these expenses as needed. The trustee requested that the Tribunal enjoin XTO Energy from continuing to deduct the Fankhouser settlement amount while the arbitration is pending. The Tribunal ordered that pending the issuance of a final award or further order of the Tribunal, XTO Energy should not treat any costs or expenses associated with the Fankhouser settlement as chargeable against the trusts net profit interest under the conveyances. The Tribunal denied the trustees request for an interim order directing XTO Energy to pay the trust the amounts offset against the trusts September and October 2012 distributions on the basis of the Fankhouser litigation. Based on this decision, deductions associated with the Fankhouser settlement were suspended starting in November 2012. XTO Energy has 18 Table of Contents also informed the trustee that during the pendency of this action, no adjustment will be made to the net profits to the trust on a go-forward basis based on the changes in the way costs will be allocated to royalty owners in accordance with the Fankhouser settlement. In September 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed against XTO Energy styled Wallace B. Roderick Revocable Living Trust, et al. v. XTO Energy Inc. in the District Court of Kearny County, Kansas. XTO Energy removed the case to federal court in Wichita, Kansas. The plaintiffs allege that XTO Energy has improperly taken post-production costs from royalties paid to the plaintiffs from wells located in Kansas, Oklahoma and Colorado. The plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class, including only Kansas and Oklahoma wells not part of the Fankhouser matter. After filing the motion to certify, but prior to the class certification hearing, the plaintiff filed a motion to sever the Oklahoma portion of the case so it could be transferred and consolidated with a newly filed class action in Oklahoma styled Chieftain Royalty Company v. XTO Energy Inc. This motion was granted. The Roderick case now comprises only Kansas wells not previously included in the Fankhouser matter. The case was certified as a class action in March 2012. XTO Energy filed an appeal of the class certification to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals on April 11, 2012 which was granted on June 26, 2012. The court reversed the certification of the class and remanded the case back to the trial court for further proceedings. In December 2010, a class action lawsuit was filed against XTO Energy styled Chieftain Royalty Company v. XTO Energy Inc. in Coal County District Court, Oklahoma. XTO Energy removed the case to federal court in the Eastern District of Oklahoma. The plaintiffs allege that XTO Energy wrongfully deducted fees from royalty payments on Oklahoma wells, failed to make diligent efforts to secure the best terms available for the sale of gas and its constituents, and demand an accounting to determine whether they have been fully and fairly paid gas royalty interests. The case expressly excludes those claims and wells prosecuted in the Fankhouser case. The severed Roderick case claims related to the Oklahoma portion of the case were consolidated into Chieftain. The case was certified as a class action in April 2012. XTO Energy filed an appeal of the class certification to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals on April 26, 2012 which was granted on June 26, 2012. The court reversed the certification of the class and remanded the case back to the trial court for further proceedings. XTO Energy has informed the trustee that it believes that XTO Energy has strong defenses to these lawsuits and intends to vigorously defend its position. However, XTO Energy has informed the trustee that it is cognizant of other, similar litigation, such as Fankhouser, and other, unrelated entities. As these cases develop, XTO Energy will assess its legal position accordingly. If XTO Energy ultimately makes any settlement payments or receives a judgment against it in Chieftain or Roderick, XTO Energy has advised the trustee that it believes that the terms of the conveyances covering the trusts net profits interests require the trust to bear its 80% share of such settlement or judgment related to production from the underlying properties. Additionally, if the judgment or settlement increases the amount of future payments to royalty owners, XTO Energy has informed the trustee that the trust would bear its proportionate share of the increased payments through reduced net proceeds. In the event of any such settlement or judgment, the trustee intends to review any claimed reductions in payment to the trust based on the facts and circumstances of such settlement or judgment. XTO Energy has informed the trustee that, although the amount of any reduction in net proceeds is not presently determinable, in its managements opinion, the amount is not currently expected to be material to the trusts financial position or liquidity though it could be material to the trusts annual distributable income. Additionally, XTO Energy has advised the trustee that any reductions would result in costs exceeding revenues on the properties underlying the net profit interests of the cases named above, as applicable, for several monthly distributions, depending on the size of the judgment or settlement, if any, and the net proceeds being paid at that time, which would result in the net profits interest being limited until such time that the revenues exceed the costs for those net profit interests. If there is a settlement or judgment and should XTO Energy and the trustee disagree concerning the amount of the settlement or judgment to be charged, if any, against the trusts net profits interests, the matter will be resolved by binding arbitration under the terms of the Indenture creating the trust through the American Arbitration Association. On September 12, 2012, a lawsuit was filed against Bank of America as trustee and XTO Energy styled Harold Lamb v. Bank of America and XTO Energy Inc., in the U.S. District Court  Western District of Oklahoma. The plaintiff, Harold Lamb, is a unitholder in the trust and alleges that XTO Energy failed to properly pay and account to the trust under the terms of the net overriding royalty conveyance on certain Kansas and Oklahoma properties and that Bank of America, N.A., as trustee, failed to properly oversee such payment and accounting by XTO Energy. Additionally, the plaintiff alleged that Bank of America, N.A. and XTO Energy breached a fiduciary duty to the trust based on the allegations found in the Fankhouser class action discussed above. The plaintiffs sought unspecified amounts for actual/compensatory damages, punitive damages, disgorgement and injunctive relief. 19 Table of Contents Subsequently, the plaintiff dismissed Bank of America, N.A. from the lawsuit. The court granted XTO Energys motion to transfer venue and transferred the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The Court granted XTOs motion to dismiss and dismissed the case citing the plaintiffs failure to make a sufficient pre-suit demand on the trustee. Subsequent to the dismissal, attorneys for Mr. Lamb sent a letter to the trustee demanding that the trustee initiate proceedings against XTO Energy. The trustee declined to do so, and on December 31, 2013, the plaintiff filed a new lawsuit against Bank of America, N.A. as trustee (as nominal defendant) and XTO Energy styled Harold Lamb v. XTO Energy Inc. and Bank of America in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. XTO Energy and Bank of America, N.A. have appeared in the lawsuit and are currently seeking dismissal of all claims. XTO Energy has informed the trustee that it believes that XTO Energy has strong defenses to this lawsuit and intends to vigorously defend its position. The trustee will vigorously defend any claims that may be asserted against the trustee. The terms of the trust indenture provide that Bank of America, N.A. and/or the trustee shall be indemnified by the trust and shall have no liability, other than for fraud, gross negligence or acts or omissions in bad faith as adjudicated by final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. On August 12, 2013, a demand for arbitration styled Sandra G. Goebel vs. XTO Energy, Inc., Timberland Gathering & Processing Company, Inc. and Bank of America, N.A. was filed with the American Arbitration Association. The claimant, Sandra Goebel, is a unitholder in the trust and alleged that XTO Energy breached the conveyances by misappropriating funds from the trust by failing to modify its existing sales contracts with its affiliate Timberland Gathering & Processing Company, Inc. (Timberland). Goebel alleged that these contracts do not currently reflect market rate terms, and that XTO had a duty to renegotiate the contracts to obtain more favorable terms. The claimant further alleged that Bank of America, N.A. breached its fiduciary duty by acquiescing to and facilitating XTO Energys alleged self-dealing and concealing information from unitholders that would have revealed XTO Energys breaches. The claim also alleged aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty by XTO Energy, and disgorgement and unjust enrichment by Timberland. The claimant sought from the respondents damages of an estimated $59.6 million for alleged royalty underpayments, exemplary damages, an accounting by XTO Energy, a declaration, costs, reasonable attorneys fees, and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. Goebel purported to sue on behalf of and for the benefit of the Hugoton Royalty Trust. The trustee filed a response to the arbitration demand denying any liability arising out of the claimants allegations and objecting to the arbitrability of Goebels claims against the trustee. The arbitration panel ruled that Goebels claims are not arbitrable and dismissed the claims in their entirety without prejudice. Goebel has refiled the matter as a lawsuit styled Sandra G. Goebel vs. XTO Energy, Inc., Timberland Gathering & Processing Company, Inc. and Bank of America, N.A. in the Dallas County District Court. The allegations are the same as those contained in the previous arbitration demand. XTO Energy has informed the trustee that it believes that XTO Energy has strong defenses to this lawsuit and intends to vigorously defend its position. The trustee also believes it has strong defenses to the lawsuit and will vigorously defend its position. The terms of the trust indenture provide that Bank of America, N.A. and/or the trustee shall be indemnified by the trust and shall have no liability, other than for fraud, gross negligence or acts or omissions in bad faith as adjudicated by final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The trustee anticipates that the trust will incur additional legal and other expenses in connection with the Goebel litigation. As a result, the trustee reserved an additional $1.6 million from trust distributions, beginning with the September 2013 distribution. The September 2013 through December 2013 distributions each reflected a deduction of $400,000 in connection with such reserve. Additionally, the trustee intends to reserve an additional $1.6 million from trust distributions for the Lamb litigation, which it currently anticipates taking over a period of four months, beginning with the January 2014 distribution. As the above lawsuits progress the trustee may need to revise these reserves. Certain of the underlying properties are involved in various other lawsuits and certain governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. XTO Energy has advised the trustee that it does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims will have a material effect on the financial position or liquidity of the trust, but may have an effect on annual distributable income.

(b) Oil and gas sales volumes are allocated to the net profits interests based upon a formula that considers oil and gas prices and the total amount of production expense and development costs. As product prices change, the trusts share of the production volumes is impacted as the quantity of production to cover expenses in reaching the net profits break-even level changes inversely with price. As such, the underlying property production volume changes may not correlate with the trusts net profit share of those volumes in any given period. Therefore, comparative discussion of oil and gas sales volumes is based on the underlying properties. (c) See Note 5 to Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

(e) See Note 11 to Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 22 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 Net profits income for 2013 was $37,333,595, as compared with $25,132,038 for 2012 and $56,565,368 for 2011. The 49% increase in net profits income from 2012 to 2013 is primarily the result of higher oil and gas prices ($13.1 million), the portion of the Fankhouser settlement deducted in September and October 2012 ($4.4 million) and proceeds from the property sale in May 2013 ($1.0 million), partially offset by decreased oil and gas production ($6.3 million). The 56% decrease in net profits income from 2011 to 2012 is primarily the result of lower gas prices ($25.2 million), decreased oil and gas production ($5.0 million) and the portion of the Fankhouser settlement deducted in September and October of 2012 ($4.4 million), partially offset by lower development costs ($2.2 million). Approximately 76% in 2013, 74% in 2012 and 81% in 2011 of net profits income was derived from natural gas sales. Trust administration expense was $2,827,015 in 2013 as compared to $1,859,626 in 2012 and $801,563 in 2011. Included in 2013 administration expense is $1,600,000 which the trustee has reserved for legal expenses regarding the Goebel litigation and included in 2012 was $900,000 which the trustee reserved for legal expenses regarding the Fankhouser class action settlement. Interest income was $700 in 2013, $508 in 2012 and $1,155 in 2011. Changes in interest income are attributable to fluctuations in net profits income and interest rates. Distributable income was $34,507,280 or $0.862682 per unit in 2013, $23,272,920 or $0.581823 per unit in 2012 and $55,764,960 or $1.394124 per unit in 2011. Net profits income is recorded when received by the trust, which is the month following receipt by XTO Energy, and generally two months after oil and gas production. Net profits income is generally affected by three major factors:  oil and gas sales volumes,  oil and gas sales prices, and  costs deducted in the calculation of net profits income. Volumes From 2012 to 2013, underlying gas sales volumes decreased 8% primarily due to natural production decline. Underlying oil sales volumes decreased 5% primarily due to natural production decline, partially offset by the timing of cash receipts. From 2011 to 2012, underlying gas sales volumes decreased 6% and underlying oil sales volumes decreased 8% primarily due to natural production decline. The estimated rate of natural production decline on the underlying oil and gas properties is approximately 6% to 8% a year. Prices Gas. The 2013 average gas price was $4.03 per Mcf, a 23% increase from the 2012 average gas price of $3.28 per Mcf, which was a 31% decrease from the 2011 average gas price of $4.73 per Mcf. Natural gas prices are affected by the level of North American production, weather, crude oil and natural gas liquids prices, the U.S. economy, storage levels and import levels of liquefied natural gas. Natural gas prices are expected to remain volatile. The average NYMEX price for November 2013 through January 2014 was $3.91 per MMBtu. At February 18, 2014, the average NYMEX gas price for the following 12 months was $4.81 per MMBtu. Oil. The average oil price for 2013 was $95.25 per Bbl, 4% higher than the average oil price for 2012 of $91.30 per Bbl, which was 1% higher than the average oil price for 2011 of $90.07 per Bbl. Oil prices are expected to remain volatile. The average NYMEX price for November 2013 through January 2014 was $95.58 per Bbl. At February 18, 2014, the average NYMEX oil price for the following 12 months was $97.99 per Bbl. Costs The calculation of net profits income includes deductions for production expense, development costs and overhead since the related underlying properties are working interests. If monthly costs exceed revenues for any state, these excess costs must be recovered, with accrued interest, from future net proceeds of that state and cannot reduce net profits income from another state. See Excess costs below. 23 Table of Contents Taxes, transportation and other. Taxes, transportation and other generally fluctuates with changes in total revenues. Taxes, transportation and other decreased 2% from 2012 to 2013 primarily because of decreased property taxes related to decreased valuations, partially offset by increased gas production taxes related to higher gas revenues. Taxes, transportation and other decreased 19% from 2011 to 2012 primarily because of decreased gas production taxes and other deductions related to lower gas revenues, partially offset by increased property taxes related to increased valuations. Production expense. Production expense decreased 4% from 2012 to 2013 primarily because of decreased repairs and maintenance, compressor and outside operated costs, partially offset by increased labor and field costs. Production expense increased 7% from 2011 to 2012 primarily because of increased labor, repairs and maintenance costs and mechanical and marketing rebates included in 2011, partially offset by decreased fuel costs. Development costs. Development costs deducted were $6.5 million in 2013, $6.0 million in 2012 and $8.8 million in 2011. In 2013, actual development costs were $5.6 million. At December 31, 2013, cumulative budgeted costs exceeded cumulative actual costs by approximately $0.6 million. The monthly development cost deduction was $850,000 from the January 2011 distribution through the August 2011 distribution. Due to lower than anticipated actual costs as a result of reduced activity, the development cost deduction was decreased to $500,000 beginning with the September 2011 distribution and was maintained at that level through the July 2013 distribution. As a result of increased development activity, the monthly development cost deduction was increased from $500,000 to $600,000 beginning with the August 2013 distribution and was maintained at that level through the end of 2013. For further information on 2014 budgeted development costs, see Properties, under Item 2. The monthly deduction is based on the current level of development expenditures, budgeted future development costs and the cumulative actual costs under (over) previous deductions. XTO Energy has advised the trustee that this monthly deduction will continue to be evaluated and revised as necessary. Overhead. Overhead is charged by XTO Energy for administrative expenses incurred to support operations of the underlying properties. Overhead fluctuates based on changes in the active well count and drilling activity on the underlying properties, as well as an annual cost level adjustment. Excess costs. Costs exceeded revenues by $114,245 ($91,396 net to the trust) on properties underlying the Wyoming net profits interests in July 2012. Lower gas prices and increased production expenses related to the timing of cash disbursements caused costs to exceed revenues on properties underlying the Wyoming net profits interests. However, these excess costs did not reduce net proceeds from the remaining conveyances. XTO advised the trustee that increased gas prices and decreased production expenses led to the full recovery of excess costs, plus accrued interest of $314 ($251 net to the trust) in August 2012. XTO advised the trustee in September 2012 that it deducted $35,601,400 ($28,481,120 net to the trust) related to the Fankhouser settlement. The settlement deduction caused costs to exceed revenues by $27,235,464 ($21,788,371 net to the trust) on properties underlying the Oklahoma net profits interests and by $6,225,126 ($4,980,101 net to the trust) on properties underlying the Kansas net profits interests. However, these excess costs did not reduce net proceeds from the remaining conveyance. XTO advised the trustee in October 2012 that it partially recovered $3,342,186 ($2,673,749 net to the trust) of excess costs. Remaining excess costs at December 31, 2012 were $24,027,648 ($19,222,118 net to the trust) on properties underlying the Oklahoma net profits interests and $6,090,756 ($4,872,605 net to the trust) on properties underlying the Kansas net profits interests. The excess costs claimed underlying the Kansas and Oklahoma net profits interests are the subject of pending arbitration described more fully under Item 3  Legal Proceedings. See Note 8 to Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Fourth Quarter 2013 and 2012 During fourth quarter 2013 the trust received net profits income totaling $9,228,643 compared with fourth quarter 2012 net profits income of $4,970,935. This 86% increase in net profits income was primarily due to higher oil and gas prices ($3.6 million) and the portion of the Fankhouser settlement deducted in October of 2012 ($2.7 million), partially offset by decreased gas production ($1.7 million). Administration expense was $1,799,868 and interest income was $145, resulting in fourth quarter 2013 distributable income of $7,428,920 or $0.185723 per unit. Included in fourth quarter 2013 administration expense is $1,200,000 which the trustee has reserved for legal expenses regarding the Goebel litigation. Distributable income for fourth quarter 2012 was $4,736,320 or $0.118408 per unit. 24 Table of Contents Distributions to unitholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2013 were: Record Date Payment Date Per Unit October 31, 2013 November 15, 2013 $ 0.068593 November 29, 2013 December 13, 2013 0.061951 December 31, 2013 January 15, 2014 0.055179 $ 0.185723 Volumes Fourth quarter underlying gas sales volumes decreased 10% and underlying oil sales volumes remained relatively flat from 2012 to 2013. Gas sales volumes decreased primarily due to natural production decline and the timing of cash receipts. Oil sales volumes remained relatively flat as the timing of cash receipts was offset by natural production decline. Prices The average fourth quarter 2013 gas price was $3.97 per Mcf, or 21% higher than the fourth quarter 2012 average price of $3.28 per Mcf. The average fourth quarter 2013 oil price was $102.44 per Bbl, or 18% higher than the fourth quarter 2012 average price of $86.92 per Bbl. For further information about product prices, see Years Ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011  Prices above. Costs Taxes, transportation and other. Taxes, transportation and other decreased 10% from fourth quarter 2012 to 2013 primarily because of decreased property taxes related to decreased valuations. Production expense. Fourth quarter production expense increased 3% from 2012 to 2013 primarily because of increased location costs, mechanical and marketing rebates included in fourth quarter 2012 and increased compressor costs, partially offset by decreased repairs and maintenance costs. Development costs. Development costs, which were deducted based on budgeted development costs, increased 20% from fourth quarter 2012 to 2013. For further information about development costs, see Years Ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011  Development Costs above. Overhead. Overhead is charged by XTO Energy for administrative expenses incurred to support operations of the underlying properties. Overhead fluctuates based on changes in the active well count and drilling activity on the underlying properties, as well as an annual cost level adjustment. Excess costs. XTO advised the trustee in September 2012 that it deducted $35,601,400 ($28,481,120 net to the trust) related to the Fankhouser settlement. The settlement deduction caused costs to exceed revenues by $27,235,464 ($21,788,371 net to the trust) on properties underlying the Oklahoma net profits interests and by $6,225,126 ($4,980,101 net to the trust) on properties underlying the Kansas net profits interests. However, these excess costs did not reduce net proceeds from the remaining conveyance. XTO advised the trustee in October 2012 that it partially recovered $3,342,186 ($2,673,749 net to the trust) of excess costs. Remaining excess costs at December 31, 2012 were $24,027,648 ($19,222,118 net to the trust) on properties underlying the Oklahoma net profits interests and $6,090,756 ($4,872,605 net to the trust) on properties underlying the Kansas net profits interests. The excess costs claimed underlying the Kansas and Oklahoma net profits interests are the subject of pending arbitration described more fully under Item 3  Legal Proceedings. See Note 8 to Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Other In accordance with the terms of the Hugoton Royalty Trust Indenture, XTO Energy advised the trustee that on April 24, 2013 it sold properties underlying the Oklahoma net profits interests for $1,188,430 ($950,744 net to the trust). This amount was included in the May 2013 distribution. 25 Table of Contents The trust is required to join in a sale of up to 1% of the value of the net profits interests in any calendar year, pursuant to notice from XTO Energy of its desire to sell the related underlying properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources The trusts only cash requirement is the monthly distribution of its income to unitholders, which is funded by the monthly receipt of net profits income after payment of trust administration expenses. The trust is not liable for any production costs or liabilities attributable to the net profits interests. If at any time the trust receives net profits income in excess of the amount due, the trust is not obligated to return such overpayment, but future net profits income payable to the trust will be reduced by the overpayment, plus interest at the prime rate. The trust may borrow funds required to pay trust liabilities if fully repaid prior to further distributions to unitholders. The trust does not have any transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or persons that could materially affect the trusts liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change Regulation There is an increased focus by local, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change. Several states have adopted climate change legislation and regulations, and various other regulatory bodies have announced their intent to regulate GHG emissions or adopt climate change regulations. As these regulations are under development, XTO Energy is unable to predict the total impact of the potential regulations upon the operators of the underlying properties, and it is possible that the operators of the underlying properties could face increases in operating costs in order to comply with climate change or GHG emissions legislation, which costs could reduce net proceeds payable to the trust and trust distributions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The trust has no off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The trust has not guaranteed the debt of any other party, nor does the trust have any other arrangements or relationships with other entities that could potentially result in unconsolidated debt, losses or contingent obligations. Contractual Obligations As shown below, the trust had no obligations and commitments to make future contractual payments as of December 31, 2013, other than the December distribution payable to unitholders in January 2014, as reflected in the statement of assets, liabilities and trust corpus. Payments due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than5 Years Distribution payable to unitholders $ 2,207,160 $ 2,207,160 $  $  $  Related Party Transactions The underlying properties from which the net profits interests were carved are currently owned by XTO Energy, which operates approximately 95% of the underlying properties. In computing net proceeds, XTO Energy deducts a monthly overhead charge for reimbursement of administrative expenses on the underlying properties it operates. As of December 31, 2013, the monthly overhead charge, based on the number of operated wells, was approximately $1,001,000 ($800,800 net to the trust) and is subject to annual adjustment based on an oil and gas industry index. XTO Energy sells a significant portion of natural gas production from the underlying properties to certain of XTO Energys wholly owned subsidiaries under contracts in existence when the trust was created, generally at amounts approximating monthly published market prices. For further information regarding natural gas sales from the underlying properties to affiliates of XTO Energy, see Significant Properties, under
