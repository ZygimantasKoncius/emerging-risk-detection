Item 1A. Risk Factors. Any investment in our company will be subject to risks inherent to our business. Before making an investment decision, investors should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or focused on or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In that case, holders of our securities may lose all or part of their investment. Risks Specific to Our Company The packaged food industry is highly competitive. The packaged food industry is highly competitive. Numerous brands and products, including private label products, compete for shelf space and sales, with competition based primarily on product quality, convenience, price, trade promotion, brand recognition and loyalty, customer service, effective consumer advertising and promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences. We compete with a significant number of companies of varying sizes, including divisions or subsidiaries of larger companies. Many of these competitors have multiple product lines, substantially greater financial and other resources available to them and may have lower fixed costs and/or are substantially less leveraged than our company. If we are unable to continue to compete successfully with these companies or if competitive pressures or other factors cause our products to lose market share or result in significant price erosion, our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. We may be unable to maintain our profitability in the face of a consolidating retail environment. Our largest customer, Wal-Mart, accounted for 11.9% of our fiscal 2007 net sales, and our ten largest customers together accounted for approximately 45.8% of our fiscal 2007 net sales. As the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and our retail customers grow larger and become more sophisticated, our retail customers may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Further, these customers are reducing their inventories and increasing their emphasis on private label products. If we fail to use our marketing expertise and unique products and category leadership positions to respond to these trends, or if we lower our prices or increase promotional support of our products and are unable to increase the volume of our products sold, our profitability and financial condition may be adversely affected. We are vulnerable to decreases in the supply and increases in the price of raw materials and labor, manufacturing, distribution and other costs, and we may not be able to offset increasing costs by increasing prices to our customers. We purchase agricultural products, meat, poultry, other raw materials, ingredients and packaging materials from growers, commodity processors, other food companies and packaging manufacturers. Raw materials, ingredients and packaging materials are subject to increases in price attributable to a number of factors, including changes in crop size, federal and state agricultural programs, export demand, energy and fuel costs, weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons, insects, plant diseases and fungi, and glass, metal and plastic prices. In fiscal 2007, our commodity prices for wheat, maple syrup, beans and corn sweeteners were higher than those incurred during fiscal 2006. In addition, the cost of labor, manufacturing, energy, fuel, packaging materials and other costs related to the production and distribution of our food products have risen significantly in recent years and at an 10 increasing rate in recent months. We expect that many of these costs will continue to rise for the foreseeable future. We manage these risks by entering into short-term supply contracts and advance commodities purchase agreements from time to time, implementing cost saving measures and, if necessary, by raising sales prices. We cannot assure you that any cost saving measures or sales price increases by us will offset increases to our raw material, ingredient, packaging and distribution costs. To the extent we are unable to offset these cost increases, our operating results, profitability and financial condition will be significantly impacted during fiscal 2008. We may be unable to offset any reduction in net sales in our mature food product categories through an increase in trade spending for these categories or an increase in net sales in other categories. Most of our food product categories are mature and certain categories have experienced declining consumption rates from time to time. If consumption rates and sales in our mature food product categories decline, our revenue and operating income may be adversely affected, and we may not be able to offset this decrease in business with increased trade spending or an increase in sales or profitability of other products and product categories. We may have difficulties integrating recent or future acquisitions or identifying new acquisitions. We completed the Cream of Wheat acquisition in February 2007 and we expect to pursue additional acquisitions of food product lines and businesses. However, we may be unable to identify additional acquisitions or may be unable to successfully integrate and manage the product lines or businesses that we have recently acquired or that we may acquire in the future. In addition, we may be unable to achieve a substantial portion of any anticipated cost savings from recent or future acquisitions or other anticipated benefits in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. In addition, any acquired product lines or businesses may require a greater amount of trade, promotional and capital spending than we anticipate. Historically, we have grown net sales for some but not all of the brands we have acquired. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies, personnel turnover and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. Any inability by us to integrate and manage any acquired product lines or businesses in a timely and efficient manner, any inability to achieve a substantial portion of any anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate or any unanticipated required increases in trade, promotional or capital spending could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Moreover, future acquisitions by us could result in our incurring substantial additional indebtedness, being exposed to contingent liabilities or incurring the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We may be faced with a disruption in sales of certain of our Cream of Wheat products if we are unable to timely complete a capital project to move production of those products from Kraft's manufacturing facility to one of our manufacturing facilities. Nearly half of our Cream of Wheat products are co-packed for us by a third-party manufacturer located in the United States. The remaining Cream of Wheat products were manufactured for us by Kraft in a Kraft facility located in Cobourg, Canada pursuant to a transition co-packing agreement that expired on February 25, 2008. During fiscal 2007, we initiated a capital project to expand our Stoughton, Wisconsin facility and to move the Kraft manufacturing equipment located in Cobourg into our Stoughton facility. We anticipate that the project will be completed, and that we will begin producing those products formerly produced in Cobourg at our Stoughton facility during the first half of 2008. In the meantime, we believe that we have purchased sufficient inventories of such products from Kraft so as to avoid any disruption in sales. If, however, there are any unanticipated delays in the completion of the capital project and our existing inventories of those Cream of Wheat products are insufficient to meet customer demand, we may face a material disruption in sales that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 11 Financial market conditions may impede our access to, or increase the cost of, financing for acquisitions. The recent changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions and tightening of the credit markets, may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for acquisitions or increase the cost of obtaining financing. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies that are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. A decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. We have substantial indebtedness, which could restrict our ability to pay dividends with respect to shares of our Class A common stock; restrict our ability to pay interest on our senior subordinated notes and our senior notes; and impact our financing options and liquidity position. At December 29, 2007, we had total long-term indebtedness of $535.8 million, including $370.0 million principal amount of senior indebtedness, and $165.8 million principal amount of senior subordinated indebtedness. Our ability to pay dividends is subject to contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing our indebtedness. While our credit facility, our senior notes indenture and our senior subordinated notes indenture contain covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt, as long as we meet these covenants we will be able to incur additional indebtedness. The degree to which we are leveraged on a consolidated basis could have important consequences to the holders of our securities, including: our ability in the future to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions may be limited; we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all; a significant portion of our cash flow is likely to be dedicated to the payment of interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for future operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions and/or dividends on our Class A common stock; and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and be limited in our ability to withstand competitive pressures. We are subject to restrictive debt covenants and other requirements related to our debt that limit our business flexibility by imposing operating and financial restrictions on our operations. The agreements governing our indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions prohibit or limit, among other things: the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the issuance of certain preferred stock or redeemable capital stock; the payment of dividends on, and purchase or redemption of, capital stock; a number of other restricted payments, including investments; specified sales of assets; specified transactions with affiliates; the creation of a number of liens; and consolidations, mergers and transfers of all or substantially all of our assets. Our credit facility and our senior notes indenture include other and more restrictive covenants and prohibit us from prepaying our other indebtedness, including our senior subordinated notes, while 12 senior indebtedness is outstanding. Our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests, including, without limitation, the following: a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum senior leverage ratio. Our ability to comply with the ratios or tests may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. A breach of any of these covenants, or failure to meet or maintain ratios or tests could result in a default under our credit facility, the terms of our senior notes indenture and/or our senior subordinated notes indenture. Certain events of default under our credit facility and the terms of our senior notes indenture would prohibit us from making payments on our senior subordinated notes, including payment of interest when due, and from paying dividends on our common stock. In addition, upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility or the terms of our senior notes indenture, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our credit facility and the senior notes, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against the security granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If the lenders accelerate the payment of the indebtedness, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full this indebtedness and our other indebtedness, including our senior subordinated notes. To service our indebtedness, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. We may not be able to repay or refinance our credit facility, our senior subordinated notes or our senior notes upon terms acceptable to us if at all. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions depends on our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities in the future. This ability, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. A significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities is dedicated to servicing our debt requirements. In addition, in accordance with our current dividend policy we distribute a significant portion of any remaining cash flow to our stockholders in the form of dividends. Our ability to continue to expand our business is, to a certain extent, dependent upon our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility and to obtain other third-party financing, including through the sale of separately traded Class A common stock, EISs or other securities. Our credit facility is subject to periodic renewal or must otherwise be refinanced. Likewise, we expect that we will refinance our senior notes at or prior to maturity, which will be substantially prior to the maturity date of the senior subordinated notes. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness, including our credit facility or our senior notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we would be forced to seek other alternatives, including: sales of assets; sales of equity; and negotiations with our lenders or noteholders to restructure the applicable debt. In addition, if we are unable to refinance the senior subordinated notes or the senior notes, our failure to repay all amounts due on the applicable maturity date would cause a default under the applicable indentures. If we are forced to pursue any of the above options, our business and/or the value of an investment in our securities could be adversely affected. 13 We rely on co-packers for a significant portion of our manufacturing needs, and the inability to enter into additional or future co-packing agreements may result in our failure to meet customer demand. We rely upon co-packers for a significant portion of our manufacturing needs. The success of our business depends, in part, on maintaining a strong sourcing and manufacturing platform. We believe that there are a limited number of competent, high-quality co-packers in the industry, and if we were required to obtain additional or alternative co-packing agreements or arrangements in the future, we can provide no assurance that we would be able to do so on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner. Our inability to enter into satisfactory co-packing agreements could limit our ability to implement our business plan or meet customer demand. We rely on the performance of major retailers, wholesalers, specialty distributors and mass merchants for the success of our business, and should they perform poorly or give higher priority to other brands or products, our business could be adversely affected. We sell our products principally to retail outlets and wholesale distributors including, traditional supermarkets, mass merchants, warehouse clubs, wholesalers, food service distributors and direct accounts, specialty food distributors, military commissaries and non-food outlets such as drug store chains and dollar stores. The replacement by or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers or chains or our inability to collect accounts receivable from our customers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our customers offer branded and private label products that compete directly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, there is a risk that our customers may give higher priority to their own products or to the products of our competitors. In the future, our customers may not continue to purchase our products or provide our products with adequate levels of promotional support. We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, which may result in decreased demand for our products. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing tastes, dietary habits and product packaging preferences of consumers in the market categories in which we compete. If we are not able to anticipate, identify or develop and market products that respond to these changes in consumer preferences, demand for our products may decline and our operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, we may incur significant costs related to developing and marketing new products or expanding our existing product lines in reaction to what we perceive to be increased consumer preference or demand. Such development or marketing may not result in the volume of sales or profitability anticipated. Severe weather conditions and natural disasters can affect crop supplies and reduce our operating results. Severe weather conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes or pestilence, may affect the supply of the raw materials that we use for our products. Our maple syrup products, for instance, are particularly susceptible to severe freezing conditions in Québec, Canada and Vermont during the season in which maple syrup is produced. Competing manufacturers can be affected differently by weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their supplies. If our supplies of raw materials are reduced, we may not be able to find supplemental supply sources on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. 14 We are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to hazardous materials, substances and waste used in or resulting from our operations. Liabilities or claims with respect to environmental matters could have a significant negative impact on our business. As with other companies engaged in similar businesses, the nature of our operations expose us to the risk of liabilities and claims with respect to environmental matters, including those relating to the disposal and release of hazardous substances. Furthermore, our operations are governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which, among other things, regulate employee exposure to hazardous chemicals in the workplace. Any material costs incurred in connection with such liabilities or claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Any environmental or health and safety legislation or regulations enacted in the future, or any changes in how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered or interpreted may lead to an increase in compliance costs or expose us to additional risk of liabilities and claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations, exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs that could adversely affect our business. Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and other national, state and local authorities. For example, we are subject to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory program governs, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging and safety of foods. Under this program the FDA regulates manufacturing practices for foods through its current "good manufacturing practices" regulations and specifies the recipes for certain foods. Furthermore, our processing facilities and products are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local authorities, and our meat processing operation in Portland, Maine is subject to daily inspection by the USDA. Any changes in these laws and regulations could increase the cost of developing and distributing our products and otherwise increase the cost of conducting our business, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including future laws and regulations, could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. See Item 1, "BusinessGovernment Regulation." Failure by third-party co-packers to comply with environmental, food safety or other regulations may disrupt our supply of certain products and adversely affect our business. We rely on co-packers to produce certain of our products. Such co-packers, whether in the United States or outside the United States, are subject to a number of regulations, including environmental and food safety regulations. Failure by any of our co-packers to comply with regulations, or allegations of compliance failure, may disrupt their operations. Disruption of the operations of a co-packer could disrupt our supply of product, which could have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Additionally, actions we may take to mitigate the impact of any such disruption or potential disruption, including increasing inventory in anticipation of a potential production interruption, may adversely affect our results of operations. We may be subject to significant liability should the consumption of any of our products cause injury, illness or death. The sale of food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from mislabeling, tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination 15 or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling or transportation phases of production. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to recall products, leading to a material adverse effect on our business. Even if a situation does not necessitate a recall, product liability claims might be asserted against us. We have from time to time been involved in product liability lawsuits, none of which have been material to our business. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, if the consumption of any of our products causes, or is alleged to have caused, a health-related illness in the future we may become subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused injury, illness or death could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. We maintain product liability insurance in an amount that we believe to be adequate. However, we cannot be sure that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage. Additionally, we do not maintain product recall insurance. A product liability judgment against us or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Consumer concern regarding the safety and quality of food products or health concerns could adversely affect sales of certain of our products. If consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food products even without a product liability claim or a product recall, our business could be adversely affected. Consumers have been increasingly focused on food safety and health and wellness with respect to the food products they buy. The food industry is also subject to scrutiny relating to genetically modified organisms and the health implications of obesity. We have been and will continue to be impacted by publicity concerning the health implications of food products generally, which could negatively influence consumer perception and acceptance of our products and marketing programs. Developments in any of these areas could cause our results to differ materially from results that have been or may be projected. Risk associated with foreign suppliers and co-packers, including changes in import/export duties, wage rates, political or economic climates, or exchange rates, may adversely affect our operations. Our relationships with foreign suppliers and co-packers subject us to the risks of doing business outside the United States. The countries from which we source our products may be subject to political and economic instability, and may periodically enact new or revise existing laws, taxes, duties, quotas, tariffs, currency controls or other restrictions to which we are subject. Our products are subject to import duties and other restrictions, and the U.S. government may periodically impose new or revise existing duties, quotas, tariffs or other restrictions to which we are subject. In addition, changes in respective wage rates among the countries from which we and our competitors source product could substantially impact our competitive position. Changes in exchange rates, import/export duties or relative international wage rates applicable to us or our competitors could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. These changes may impact us in a different manner than our competitors. A continued weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Canadian dollar would significantly increase our future costs relating to the production of maple syrup products. We purchase the majority of our maple syrup requirements from suppliers in Québec, Canada. Over the past several years the U.S. dollar has weakened against the Canadian dollar, which has in turn significantly increased our costs relating to the production of our maple syrup products. Likewise, a continued weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Canadian dollar would significantly increase our future costs relating to the production of maple syrup products. 16 Litigation regarding our trademarks and any other proprietary rights and intellectual property infringement claims may have a significant negative impact on our business. As of February 15, 2008, we own 110 trademarks that are registered in the United States, 29 trademarks that are registered with certain U.S. states and Puerto Rico, and 394 trademarks that are registered in foreign countries. In addition, we have 12 trademark applications pending in the United States and foreign countries. We consider our trademarks to be of significant importance in our business. If the actions we take to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as an alleged violation of their trademarks and proprietary rights, it may be necessary for us to initiate or enter into litigation in the future to enforce our trademark rights or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others. Any legal proceedings could result in an adverse determination that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Our financial well-being could be jeopardized by unforeseen changes in our employees' collective bargaining agreements, shifts in union policy or labor disruptions in the food industry. As of December 29, 2007, approximately 314 of our 749 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. A prolonged work stoppage or strike at any of our facilities with union employees or a significant work disruption from other labor disputes in the food or related industries could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, if prior to the expiration of any of our existing collective bargaining agreements we are unable to reach new agreements without union action or any such new agreements are not on terms satisfactory to us, our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to retain our key management personnel, our growth and future success may be impaired and our results of operations could suffer as a result. Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of senior management, certain of whom would be difficult to replace. As a result, departure by members of our senior management could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we do not maintain key-man life insurance on any of our executive officers. We are a holding company and we rely on dividends, interest and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. We are a holding company, with all of our assets held by our direct and indirect subsidiaries, and we rely on dividends and other payments or distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations and to enable us to pay dividends. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or distributions to us depends on their respective operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the laws of their jurisdiction of organization (which may limit the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends), agreements of those subsidiaries, our credit facility, the terms of our senior notes indenture and the covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. Future changes that increase cash taxes payable by us could significantly decrease our future cash flow available to make interest and dividend payments with respect to our securities. We are able to amortize goodwill and certain intangible assets within the meaning of Section 197 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. We expect to be able to amortize for tax purposes approximately $31.2 million per year for 2008 through 2011, approximately $29.6 million for fiscal 2012, 17 approximately $28.1 million for fiscal 2013, approximately $23.3 million for fiscal 2014, approximately $22.2 million per year for fiscal 2015 through 2017, approximately $19.6 million for fiscal 2018, approximately $15.2 million per year for fiscal 2019 and 2020, approximately $13.2 million for fiscal 2021, and approximately $2.3 million for fiscal 2022. If there is a change in U.S. federal tax policy that reduces any of these available deductions or results in an increase in our corporate tax rate, our cash taxes payable may increase, which could significantly reduce our future cash and impact our ability to make interest and dividend payments. Risks Relating to our Securities Holders of our Class A common stock (including Class A common stock held as part of EISs) may not receive the level of dividends provided for in our dividend policy or any dividends at all. Dividend payments are not mandatory or guaranteed and holders of our common stock do not have any legal right to receive, or require us to pay, dividends. Our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, decrease the level of dividends provided for in our dividend policy or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends. Future dividends with respect to shares of our capital stock, if any, depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions (including restrictions in our credit facility, senior notes indenture and senior subordinated notes indenture), business opportunities, provisions of applicable law (including certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law) and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. If our cash flows from operating activities were to fall below our minimum expectations (or if our assumptions as to capital expenditures or interest expense were too low or our assumptions as to the sufficiency of our credit facility to finance our working capital needs were to prove incorrect), we may need either to reduce or eliminate dividends or, to the extent permitted under our senior notes indenture, our senior subordinated notes indenture and the terms of our credit facility, fund a portion of our dividends with borrowings or from other sources. If we were to use working capital or permanent borrowings to fund dividends, we would have less cash and/or borrowing capacity available for future dividends and other purposes, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to maintain or expand our business. Our dividend policy may negatively impact our ability to finance capital expenditures, operations or acquisition opportunities. Under our dividend policy, a substantial portion of our cash generated by our business in excess of operating needs, interest and principal payments on indebtedness, and capital expenditures sufficient to maintain our properties and assets is in general distributed as regular quarterly cash dividends to the holders of our common stock. As a result, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to finance growth opportunities or unanticipated capital expenditure needs or to fund our operations in the event of a significant business downturn. We may have to forego growth opportunities or capital expenditures that would otherwise be necessary or desirable if we do not find alternative sources of financing. If we do not have sufficient cash for these purposes, our financial condition and our business will suffer. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock and Class B Common Stock that may be senior to our Class A common stock in certain respects. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of preferred stock and Class B common stock without stockholder approval and, in the case of preferred stock, upon such terms as the board of directors may determine. The rights of the holders of shares of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future, including any preferential rights that we may grant to the holders of 18 preferred stock. The terms of any preferred stock we issue may place restrictions on the payment of dividends to the holders of our common stock. If we issue preferred stock or Class B common stock that is senior to our Class A common stock in right of dividend payment, and our cash flows from operating activities or surplus are insufficient to support dividend payments to the holders of preferred stock and/or Class B common stock, on the one hand, and to the holders Class A common stock, on the other hand, we may be forced to reduce or eliminate dividends to the holders of our Class A common stock. The separate public trading markets for EISs and separately held shares of Class A common stock, and the ability to separate and create EISs, may diminish the value of your investment in EISs or separately held shares of Class A common stock, as the case may be. Our EISs and shares of Class A common stock not held in the form of EISs are separately listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange. An EIS holder may separate each EIS into one share of Class A common stock and $7.15 principal amount of senior subordinated notes. Upon the occurrence of certain events (including redemption of the senior subordinated notes or upon maturity of the senior subordinated notes), EISs will automatically separate. Conversely, subject to limitations, a holder of separate shares of Class A common stock and senior subordinated notes can combine such securities to form EISs. Separation and creation of EISs will automatically result in increases and decreases, respectively, in the number of shares of Class A common stock not held in the form of EISs and in the number of EISs. We cannot predict what effect separate trading markets in EISs and separately held shares of Class A common stock, or fluctuations in the number of such securities, will have on the value of such securities. If the value of separately held Class A common stock is deemed to be less than the value of the same security underlying an EIS, creation of EISs by combining such separate shares with any then available separate senior subordinated notes may become more attractive. Conversely, if the value of an EIS is deemed to be less than the value of its components, separation of EISs may become more attractive. Any reduction in the number of either EISs or separately held shares of Class A common stock would decrease the liquidity for the remaining EISs or separately held shares of Class A common stock, as the case may be, which could further diminish the value of such securities. Furthermore, if the number of either of such securities outstanding falls below the minimum required for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, such securities may be delisted from such exchange. Future sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock (separately or as part of EISs) or other securities convertible or exchangeable into Class A common stock may depress the price of our Class A common stock and EISs. We may issue shares of our Class A common stock (separately or as part of EISs), or other securities convertible or exchangeable into Class A common stock from time to time in future financings or as consideration for future acquisitions and investments. In the event any such future financing, acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our Class A common stock, EISs or other securities convertible or exchangeable into Class A common stock that we may issue may in turn be significant. In addition, we may grant registration rights covering shares of our Class A common stock, EISs or other securities convertible or exchangeable into Class A common stock, as applicable, issued in connection with any such future financing, acquisitions and investments. Future sales or the availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock (separate or in the form of EISs) or other securities convertible or exchangeable into Class A common stock would dilute our earnings per share and the voting power of each share of Class A common stock outstanding prior to such sale or distribution, could adversely affect the prevailing 19 market price of our securities and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of our securities. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and several other factors could limit another party's ability to acquire us and deprive our investors of the opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for their securities. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions that may make it difficult for another company to acquire us and for holders of our securities to receive any related takeover premium for their securities. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of preferred stock without stockholder approval and upon such terms as the board of directors may determine. The rights of the holders of shares of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future.
