Risk Factors. You should consider carefully the following risks. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or a part of the money you paid to buy our common stock. Our business may be materially adversely impacted by U.S. and global market and economic conditions For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the banking and insurance industries and other financial services firms. Given the concentration of our business activities in financial industries, we may be particularly exposed to economic downturns in those industries. U.S. and global market and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, disrupted and volatile, and in recent months the volatility has reached unprecedented levels. General business and economic conditions that could affect us and our customers include fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, liquidity of the global financial markets, the availability and cost of credit, investor and consumer confidence, and the strength of the economies in which our customers operate. A poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand for our products and services, including the delay or cancellation of current or anticipated projects, and adversely affect our operating results. In addition to mergers and acquisitions in the banking industry, we are also beginning to see an increased level of bank closures and government supervised consolidation transactions. Our existing customers may be acquired by or merged into other financial institutions that have their own financial software solutions, be closed by regulators, or decide to terminate their relationships with us for other reasons. As a result, our sales could decline if an existing customer is merged with or acquired by another company or closed. We expect that the revenue we generate from our largest customer, State Farm, will decrease over the next three years as our work efforts for them conclude by the end of 2011 which may cause our financial performance to suffer State Farm accounted for 18%, 21% and 25% of our total revenue from continuing operations and 33%, 39% and 48% of our Enterprise segment revenue during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2008, we announced that we expected our relationship with State Farm to conclude by the end of 2011. We expect approximately $80 million in revenue from State Farm from 2009 until our work for them concludes by the end of 2011, of which we expect approximately $35 - $37 million in revenue in 2009. We can give no assurance that we will be able to generate the foregoing revenue amounts from State Farm or that we will be able to replace the revenue or associated gross margin from State Farm. Security breaches or computer viruses could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services, damaging our reputation and business, or resulting in material liability to us Our products and business may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other disruptive problems. In the course of providing services to our customers, we may collect, store, process or transmit sensitive and confidential financial information. Accordingly, it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure. A security breach affecting us could damage our reputation, deter organizations from purchasing our products, deter their end-user customers from using our products, or result in material liability to us. Privacy, security, and compliance concerns continue to increase. Security compromises, including identity theft and fraud, could deter people from using electronic commerce services such as ours. We may need to spend significant capital or other resources for compliance requirements and protection against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches. Additionally, computer viruses could infiltrate our systems and disrupt our business. Any inability to prevent security breaches, fraud or computer viruses could cause our customers to lose confidence in our services and terminate their agreements with us, and could reduce our ability to attract new customers or result in material liability to us. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and any fluctuations could adversely affect the price of our common stock Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly to date. If we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors as a result of any future fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. We may experience fluctuations in future quarters because:  we cannot accurately predict the value, number and timing of license or services agreements we will sign in a period, in part because the budget constraints and internal review processes of existing and potential customers are not within our control;  as we sell our products on both a perpetual license and a term or subscription license, we cannot accurately predict the mix of perpetual licenses to term licenses sold in any one quarter. Term licenses significantly reduce the amount of revenue recognized in the first year of the contract, but is intended to increase the overall revenue earned from the customer during the typical customer life cycle; perpetual license revenue can vary significantly on a quarterly basis;  the length of our sales cycle to large financial organizations generally lasts from six to 18 months, which adds an element of uncertainty to our ability to forecast revenue;  if we fail to or are delayed in the introduction of new or enhanced products, or if our competitors introduce new or enhanced products, sales of our products and services may not achieve expected levels and/or may decline; 12 Table of Contents  our ability to expand the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold may be limited;  our products may not achieve widespread market acceptance, which could cause our revenue to be lower than expected;  we have had significant contracts with legacy customers that have decreased or terminated their services and we may not be able to replace this revenue and/or the gross margins associated with this revenue;  our sales may be constrained by the timing of releases of third-party software that works with our products;  a significant percentage of our expenses is relatively fixed and we may be unable to reduce expenses in the short term if revenue decreases; and  the migration of our license sales model to be more focused on recurring revenue contracts may result in less predictable revenue due to an inability to predict the rate at which it is adopted by our customers, or the rate at which it may be deferred. System failures, errors, defects or other performance problems with our products or data center operations could cause demand for our products to decrease, impair customer relations, or result in material liability to us Our products are used by our customers to provide services that are integral to their businesses and operations. Accordingly, any system failures, errors, defects or other performance problems could result in financial or other damages to our customers and could damage our reputation, deter organizations from purchasing our products, deter their end-user customers from using our products, or result in material liability to us. Additionally, our data center is an integral part of our business and any interruption in our data center operations, whether as a result of human error, power failure, telecommunications failure, fire, terrorism or otherwise, could damage our reputation, deter organizations from purchasing our products, deter their end-user customers from using our products, or result in material liability to us. We have engaged third-parties to assist us with certain implementation activities which may not be successful In order to optimize available professional services resources and meet delivery timeframes, we have established relationships with several third parties to assist us with implementing and customizing our products. As a result, we have less quality control over the implementation and customization of our software with respect to these deployments and are more reliant on the ability of these third parties to correctly implement and customize our software in a timely manner. While our experience to date with these third parties has been positive, there is no assurance that this will continue. If these third parties fail to properly implement our software or meet delivery deadlines, our business, reputation and financial results may be harmed. The delay or cancellation of a customer project, or inaccurate project completion estimates, may adversely affect our operating results and cause our financial performance to suffer Any unanticipated delays in a customer project, changes in customer requirements or priorities during the project implementation period, or a customers decision to cancel a project, may adversely impact our operating results and financial performance. When professional services are considered essential to the functionality of our software, we record license and professional services revenue over the project implementation period using the percentage of completion method, which is generally measured by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date to estimated total labor hours for each contract. The percentage of completion accounting method requires ongoing estimates of the progress being made on complex and difficult projects and documenting this progress is subject to potential inaccuracies. Any inaccuracies or changes in estimates may lead to significant changes to our financial results and adversely impact our operating results and financial performance. We are engaged in offshore software development activities which may not be successful and which may put our intellectual property at risk In order to optimize available research and development resources and meet development timeframes, in 2004 we acquired an Indian based development center. This center had been owned and operated for us by a third party since 2002. In 2004, associated with our acquisition of Mosaic Software Holdings Limited, we acquired a development center in Cape Town, South Africa. While our experience to date with these offshore development centers has been positive, there is no assurance this will continue. Specifically, there are a number of risks associated with this activity, including but not limited to the following:  communications and information flow may be less efficient and accurate as a consequence of time zone differences, distance and language differences between our primary development organization and the foreign based activities, resulting in delays in development or errors in the software developed;  potential disruption from the involvement of the United States in political and military conflicts around the world; 13 Table of Contents  the quality of the development efforts undertaken offshore may not meet our requirements because of language, cultural and experience differences, resulting in potential product errors and/or delays;  we have experienced a greater level of voluntary turnover of personnel in India than in other development centers which could have an adverse impact on efficiency and timeliness of development as well as the opportunity for misappropriation of our intellectual property;  in addition to the risk of misappropriation of intellectual property from departing personnel, there is a general risk that the misappropriation of our intellectual property might not be readily discoverable; and  currency exchange rates could fluctuate and adversely impact the cost advantages intended from maintaining these facilities. We are from time to time involved in litigation over intellectual property or other proprietary rights which may be costly and time consuming to defend and our operating results would suffer if we were subject to a protracted infringement claim or a significant damage award Substantial intellectual property litigation and threats of litigation exist in our industry. Third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents or assert copyrights and/or trade secrets that could be infringed by our products or technology. Any of these third parties could make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our products or technology and from time to time, we have received claims that certain of our products or other proprietary rights require a license of intellectual property rights of a party and infringe, or may infringe, the intellectual property rights of others. In some instances, our customers may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties. As a result, we provide certain indemnity for our customers against infringement claims. Even if such accusations ultimately prove lacking in merit, the disposition of such disputes may be costly, distracting, and result in damages, royalties, or injunctive relief preventing the use of the intellectual property in question and may require entering into licensing agreements, redesigning our products or ceasing production entirely. Any claims, with or without merit, could have the following negative consequences:  be time-consuming to investigate and defend;  result in costly litigation and damage awards;  divert management attention and resources;  cause product shipment delays or suspensions;  cause us to spend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, which we may not be able to do;  result in an injunction being issued against the use and sale of our products; and  require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Infringement of our proprietary technology could hurt our competitive position and income potential Our success depends upon our proprietary technology and information. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our proprietary technology and information. Because it is difficult to police unauthorized use of software, the steps we have taken to protect our services and products may not prevent misappropriation of our technology. Any misappropriation of our proprietary technology or information could reduce any competitive advantages we may have or result in costly litigation. We also have a significant international presence and the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary technology as well as the laws of the United States. Additionally, it may be more difficult to identify the misappropriation of our intellectual property in foreign countries. Our ability to protect our proprietary technology may not be adequate. Our business and financial results may be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates In 2008, approximately 17% of our revenue and 21% of our operating expenses were transacted in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. We believe most of our international operations are naturally hedged for foreign currency risk as our foreign subsidiaries generally invoice their customers and satisfy their obligations in their local currencies. Therefore, our revenue may be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations from these international operations but the impact to our net income is generally minimized. However, our development centers in India and South Africa are not naturally hedged as their costs are in the local currency but they are funded in U.S. Dollars or British Pounds. Accordingly, currency fluctuations in the Indian Rupee or South African Rand may impact our net income. 14 Table of Contents Acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate, divert management resources or dilute stockholder value We have made acquisitions in the past and we may make additional acquisitions in the future. The integration of these companies and any future acquisitions into our existing operations is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our business. Among the issues related to integration are:  potential incompatibility of business cultures;  potential delays in integrating diverse technology platforms;  potential difficulties in coordinating geographically separated organizations;  potential difficulties in re-training sales forces to market all of our products across all of our intended markets;  potential difficulties implementing common internal business systems and processes;  potential conflicts in third-party relationships; and  potential loss of customers and key employees and the diversion of the attention of management from other ongoing business concerns. Additionally, the use of equity to finance an acquisition could dilute the interests of our stockholders. We are subject to government regulation We are subject to external audits, examination, and are indirectly regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of Thrift Supervision, National Credit Union Association and the various state financial regulatory agencies that supervise and regulate the banks, credit unions and thrift institutions for which we provide data processing services. Matters subject to review and examination by federal and state financial institution regulatory agencies and external auditors include our internal information technology controls in connection with our performance of data processing services, the agreements giving rise to those processing activities, and the design of our products that perform banking functions. Our ability to satisfy these audits and examinations and maintain compliance with applicable regulations could affect our ability to attract and maintain customers. Market volatility may affect the price of our common stock The trading prices of technology stocks in general and ours in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations. Our stock price has fluctuated after declining from its high in 2000. More recently, the financial services sector has also experienced price fluctuations. Any further negative change in the publics perception of the prospects of technology based companies, particularly those which provide services to the financial services sector such as ours, could further depress our stock price regardless of our results of operations. Other broad market and industry factors may decrease the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations, also may affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the following factors:  actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;  approximately 36% of our common stock is owned by five institutions as of December 31, 2008, and a change in position of any one of these holders could cause a significant drop in our stock price if market demand is insufficient to meet sales demand;  announcements of new products, product enhancements, technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors;  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;  conditions or trends in the computer software, electronic commerce and Internet industries;  changes in the market valuations of other technology companies;  developments in Internet regulations;  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;  unscheduled system downtime of our products in either a hosted or in-house environment;  security breaches in our software or facilities may cause harm to our business and reputation, result in a loss of customers or result in material liability to us;  additions or departures of key personnel; and  sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market. 15 Table of Contents Future sales of our common stock in the public market could negatively affect our stock price If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares issued when options are exercised or shares of our preferred stock are converted into common stock, the market price of our common stock could fall. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 52.8 million shares of common stock outstanding, assuming no exercise of outstanding options or conversion of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2008, there were outstanding employee stock options to purchase approximately 6.8 million shares of our common stock, 200 thousand shares of unvested restricted stock and 749 thousand shares of preferred stock convertible into an aggregate of 1.1 million shares of our common stock. The common stock issuable upon exercise of these options, vesting of restricted stock, and conversion of this preferred stock will be eligible for sale in the public market from time to time. The possible sale of a significant number of these shares may cause the market price of our common stock to fall. Our market is highly competitive and if we are unable to keep pace with evolving technology, our revenue and future prospects may decline The market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology, intense competition and evolving industry standards. We have many competitors who offer various components of our suite of applications or who use a different technology platform to accomplish similar tasks. In some cases, our existing customers also use some of our competitors products. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop, sell and support enhancements of current products and new software products in response to changing customer needs. If the completion of the next version of any of our products is delayed, our revenue and future prospects could be harmed. In addition, competitors may develop products or technologies that the industry considers more attractive than those we offer or that render our technology obsolete. International operations may adversely affect us We conduct our business worldwide and may be adversely affected by changes in demand resulting from:  fluctuations in currency exchange rates;  governmental currency controls;  changes in various regulatory requirements;  political, economic and military changes and disruptions;  difficulties in enforcing our contracts in foreign jurisdictions;  export/import controls;  tariff regulations;  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales, professional services, product development and support operations;  greater difficulties in trade accounts receivable collection; and  possible adverse tax consequences. Some of our solutions may use encrypted technology, the export of which is regulated by the United States government. If the United States government were to adopt new legislation restricting the export of software or encryption technology, we could experience delays or reductions in our shipments of products internationally. In addition, existing or future export regulations could limit our ability to distribute our solutions outside of the United States. We maintain international offices and portions of our maintenance, consulting, and research and development operations in Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia. Therefore, our operations may also be affected by economic conditions in international regions. Additionally, from time to time, we lend funds to our foreign subsidiaries to meet their operating and capital requirements and several of our foreign subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or limit the flow of funds from those subsidiaries. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that we need to make payments on obligations. The risks associated with international operations may harm our business. We depend upon key employees and may be unable to hire or retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel Our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key employees and on our ability to hire and retain highly skilled management, technical, sales, and customer support personnel. There is substantial competition for employees with the skills we require and we compete for qualified employees with companies that may have greater financial resources than we have. Our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 16 Table of Contents The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the Internet, or interpretations of existing law, could adversely affect our business Laws and regulations which apply to communications and commerce over the Internet are becoming more prevalent. Currently, there are Internet laws regarding copyrights, taxation and the transmission of specified types of material. Congress also adopted legislation imposing obligations on financial institutions to notify their customers of the institutions privacy practices, restrict the sharing of non-public customer data with non-affiliated parties at the customers request, and establish procedures and practices to protect and secure customer data. These privacy provisions are implemented by regulations with which compliance is required. Additionally, many legislative and regulatory actions have been enacted or are pending at the state and federal level with respect to privacy. Further, our customers and we may be faced with state and federal requirements that differ drastically, and in some cases conflict. In addition, the European Union enacted its own privacy regulations and it may in the future consider other Internet-related legislation. The law of the Internet, however, remains largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative action. It may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation apply to the Internet. In addition, the growth and development of the market for online financial services, including online and mobile banking, may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws, both in the United States and abroad, that may impose additional burdens on companies.
