D Risk Factors Investors in our company should be aware of a number of risk factors that could prevent us from achieving our stated goals, a number of which are set out below. We are subject to the same risks as any other multinational fast moving consumer goods organisation doing business; including changes in general economic conditions, regulatory changes, political instability and the impact of any unforeseen natural disasters. • Integration of acquisitions and joint ventures Acquisitions and joint ventures continue to be a component of our business strategy and we intend to achieve the anticipated benefits of such transactions when they arise. However, failure to adequately manage the integration processes and coordinate the strategies of such entities with our own could affect our total profit from operations. • Reliance on tobacco supply Tobacco is the most important raw material in the manufacture of tobacco products. We are not directly involved in the cultivation of tobacco leaf. As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf tends to be cyclical, with imbalances in supply and demand influencing future production levels. Different regions also experience variations in weather patterns, which may affect crop quality. Political unrest in any of the countries where tobacco leaf is cultivated (such as in Zimbabwe) could also significantly increase the price of these materials. Presently this situation is not materially affecting our average tobacco cost and in general terms, the effect of price fluctuations on our operating performance may be limited by the geographic spread of our tobacco leaf sources and by our practice of holding approximately between three months and one year average inventory of tobacco leaf across our locations. However, any significant change in tobacco leaf prices could affect our total profit from operations. • Increased regulation of the tobacco sector Tobacco markets are subject to significant regulatory influence from governments. These include: a) the levying of substantial and increasing tax or substantial changes to duty structures and duty charges; b) the introduction of minimum tax and minimum price legislation for cigarettes; c) restrictions such as the prohibition of smoking in many public and work places; d) restrictions on advertising and marketing; e) the display of larger health warnings, graphic pictorial warnings and statements of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide smoke yields on product packaging; f) the prohibition of certain descriptors such as light and mild; 14 Back to Contents GALLAHER GROUP Plc Form 20-F 2005 g) restrictions on the minimum number of cigarettes in packs; on the display of cigarettes at the point of sale; and on access to vending machines; h) regulations on the maximum tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide smoke yields of cigarettes; i) the effect of other regulations relating to the manufacturing, presentation and sale of tobacco products; j) the provision of tobacco ingredients information to regulators; k) requirements regarding the potentially costly analysis of ingredients and the potential for publication of proprietary brand formula information; and l) changes in duty paid allowances. Partly because of these measures, unit sales of tobacco products in certain principal markets have declined in recent years and we expect this trend to continue. Any significant decrease in demand for our products could significantly affect our total profit from operations, together with our cost of complying with increased regulatory requirements. Regulations on tobacco marketing could significantly reduce our ability to compete and therefore have an adverse effect on our sales and total profit from operations Advertising, promotion and brand building continue to play a key role in our business, with significant expenditure on programmes to support key brands and to develop our performance in markets for new brands and brand extensions. However, the regulation of advertising and marketing of tobacco products is significant and increasingly restrictive. Present and proposed regulations restrict the manner in which our products may be marketed, including restrictions on advertising, sponsorship, promotion, point of sale display and sampling of tobacco products. Additional regulations restricting these and other aspects of tobacco marketing may be proposed and come into force in the future. We will use the full range of advertising, promotion and sponsorship opportunities allowed to us for as long as these are available and will continue to explore other methods through which we can continue to build our brands. It is possible that the present and proposed regulations, as well as future regulations, may have a material adverse affect on our ability to advertise, promote and build our brands, to promote and introduce new brands and products and to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed brands and thus materially adversely affect our sales and total profit from operations. This important risk factor is discussed further in the regulation section in Item 4B. Business Overview of this Annual Report. Regulations and voluntary agreements on smoking in public places and the workplace could have an adverse effect on our sales and total profit from operations At a global level, the World Health Organisations Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) came into force in February 2005. Countries that have ratified the convention will be legally bound by the provisions of the treaty which include measures relating to environmental tobacco smoke. In addition, a number of countries have recently established, or are considering, further legislation and/or volunatary agreements that restrict or prohibit smoking in public places and the workplace, which may also include bars and restaurants. These countries include Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Republic of Ireland, Spain, Sweden and the UK. These and other current and potential restrictions on smoking in public places and the workplace may reduce the opportunities available for smoking and may reduce the demand for tobacco products. This potential reduction in demand for tobacco products may materially adversely affect our sales and total profit from operations. This important risk factor is discussed further in the regulation section in Item 4B. Business Overview of this Annual Report. Excise tax increases/changes and minimum price legislation reduce sales volumes Governments in markets where we operate have imposed considerable excise taxes on tobacco products, and some have indicated that these will continue to increase. The continuing impact of price increases in these markets, principally due to substantial duty increases in recent years, has resulted in: a) pressure on manufacturing and vending margins; b) reduced annual industry volumes; 15 Back to Contents GALLAHER GROUP Plc Form 20-F 2005 c) greater price competition; d) accelerated trading down by consumers to lower price cigarette brands or to handrolling tobacco; e) increased legitimate cross border purchasing by consumers; f) an illegal trade in tobacco products; and g) a growth in smuggled counterfeit tobacco products. These changes have affected us and are expected to continue to affect us. For instance we have, in particular, been impacted by the UK Governments policy of maintaining duty levels in excess of the duty levels of Europe. This has led to the cross border purchasing of cigarettes by travellers returning to the UK and illegal smuggling of cigarettes into the UK. Partly because of the black market, our UK sales have been reduced. The entry of Accession Countries into the European Union has exacerbated the issue of price differentials provoked by different duty structures in adjacent markets. Furthermore, any shortfall in control arrangements at the borders of the Accession Countries and Eastern Europe may impact on the legitimate EU market for tobacco products. Any of these could adversely affect our total profit from operations. In addition, some EU member states, including Ireland, France, Belgium and Italy have introduced minimum price legislation and the Austrian government has indicated that it will implement price legislation in April 2006. This may affect the sales mix of our brands. This important risk factor is discussed further in the regulation section in Item 4B. Business Overview of this Annual Report. • Declining demand for tobacco products Developed markets for tobacco products including cigarettes, have been generally declining since the 1970s. This adverse trend has been encouraged by consistent and substantial increases in the excise duty on tobacco products, increasing governmental regulation, government-funded anti-smoking campaigns and heightened public awareness of smoking-related health concerns. Any future substantial decline in sales could have a materially adverse effect on our total profit from operations. • Increasing dependence on sales in the Commonwealth of Independent States and other emerging markets We continue to increase our sales in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and other emerging markets. The economic conditions in these countries have in the past suffered from substantially depressed economies, devaluation of currencies and an unstable political and commercial environment. Any deterioration in the current conditions may affect the profitability of our operations in these countries. • Cost of compliance with regulatory requirements We are subject to increasing costs associated with regulatory requirements, eg the US Sarbanes-Oxley of 2002 (SOX), pension funding obligations and compliance with enhanced corporate governance and specific regulations impacting upon the tobacco sector within Europe and elsewhere. • Highly competitive business We must compete with other tobacco companies whose business plans and objectives may be similar to ours. Our principal competitors are Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco International, Imperial Tobacco Group and Altadis Group. Some of these companies have greater resources than we have, including R&D facilities. Action by any of our principal competitors or any other manufacturers could lead to competitive product differentiation and pricing pressure on our products. • Potential credit risk with our distributors In some of our markets we make the majority of our sales to small numbers of independent distributors. This can mean that we have large credit exposures with a relatively limited number of customers. Whilst we have robust credit control procedures in place throughout our business, the failure of one of these customers to pay receivables due to us could have a material effect on our total profit from operations and on the cash flow of our business. In addition, our business 16 Back to Contents GALLAHER GROUP Plc Form 20-F 2005 relationships with distributors internationally are governed by our sales and distribution policy, which regulates selling practices and has been developed in co-operation with the UK customs authorities. While we closely monitor adherence to this policy, a material breach by any distributor could require us to discontinue trade or incur financial penalties, which could have a material effect on our total profit from operations and cashflow. • Risks to our facilities Our production and distribution capacity is generated from facilities strategically located principally to supply markets geographically near our factories. Accordingly, a significant disruption in any of these facilities may have a material adverse effect on the production and distribution of our tobacco products and therefore on our operating results. Whilst we have the ability to produce different products in different factories the lead time to transfer to an alternative location and the corresponding difficulty in arranging distribution could cause a financial loss to our business. • Currency fluctuations affecting our financial reporting and debt levels Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, and are stated in pounds sterling. As a result our financial reporting could be adversely affected by currency fluctuations, such as a significant increase in the value of the pound sterling against the currencies in which our sales is denominated for example, the euro and the US dollar. As at 31 December 2005, approximately 33% of our net debt was denominated in pounds sterling, 51% in euro, 12% in US dollars and 4% in Polish zlotys. Accordingly, our financial results are exposed to gains or losses arising from fluctuations in pound sterling and euro exchange rates. We are also exposed to currency risk when our expenses are in a currency other than the currency used for the sale of our products. • Interest rate fluctuations We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on our net debt. In order to manage the impact of adverse variations in interest rates on our profits, we borrow a portion of our funds at fixed rates of interest and, where necessary, use interest rate derivatives to maintain a target level of fixed interest rate cover in the current and subsequent two years of between 40% and 80% of the level of core debt. For additional information about our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, please see Item 11:Quantative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk. • Difficulty in developing and managing growth Part of our business strategy is to pursue growth and start-up operations in new and existing markets. Our ability to achieve our planned growth depends on a number of factors, including: 1. our ability to compete in existing markets and identify new markets in which we can successfully operate; 2. the access to additional financial resources; 3. our ability to hire, train and retain appropriately skilled management and other employees; and 4. the increased cost to the business of pension funding and regulations relating to employees. We will also need to adapt our operating systems to accommodate the expanded operations. Such planned expansion may not be achieved or we may not be able to successfully manage the expanded operations. Failure to manage such growth effectively could adversely affect our financial condition, the results of our operations and our prospects. • Likelihood of identifying further acquisition opportunities Historically, we have engaged in acquisitions, which have been complementary to the organic growth of the Group. The continuation of this expansion strategy is dependent on, among other things, identifying suitable acquisition or investment opportunities and successfully consummating those transactions. Anti-trust or similar laws may make it difficult for us to make additional acquisitions if regulators in countries where we and potential acquisition targets operate believe that a proposed transaction will have an adverse effect on competition in the relevant market or economic region. Even if we are able to identify candidates for acquisition, it may be difficult to complete transactions. We have historically faced competition for acquisitions, and in the future this could limit our ability to grow by this method or could raise the price of acquisitions and make them less attractive to us. In addition, if we are unable to secure necessary financing, we may not be able to grow our business through acquisition. 17 Back to Contents GALLAHER GROUP Plc Form 20-F 2005 Typically, when we acquire a business we acquire all of its liabilities as well as its assets. Although we try to investigate each business thoroughly prior to acquisition and to obtain appropriate representations and warranties as to its assets and liabilities, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify all actual or potential liabilities of a company prior to its acquisition or thereafter pursue claims against vendors within the limitation periods within which such claims can be made against vendors. • Adverse litigation and regulatory results could have an impact on profits There are a number of instances where litigation or regulatory proceedings, hearings or claims are actual, pending or prospective or otherwise threatened against us. Historically, such claims have focussed upon smoking and health related matters. More recently, regulatory, anti-trust and tax related claims have become more prevalent. To date, there has been no recovery of damages against any of our companies in any action alleging that our tobacco products have resulted in human illnesses. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation. We believe that there are meritorious defences or suitable indemnities from prior risks to the actions and claims we currently face and based upon what is known to us actual, pending or prospective actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of our operations, our cash flow or our financial condition. There can be no assurance that: a) favourable decisions will be achieved in the proceedings pending against us; b) additional proceedings will not be commenced in the UK or elsewhere against us; c) we will not incur damages; or d) if we incur damages, such damages will not have a material impact on our operating performance or financial condition. Regardless of the outcome of the pending litigation, the costs of defending actions and claims could be substantial and will not be fully recoverable from the plaintiffs, irrespective of whether or not we are successful. Details of the current position are found at Item 4: Information on the company  Regulation and Litigation. • The effect of fluctuations in the pound sterling/US dollar exchange rate price on our ADSs and the US dollar value of any dividends Our ADSs trade in US dollars. Therefore, a decline in the value of the pound sterling against the US dollar would reduce the value of our ADSs as reported in US dollars. This could adversely affect the price at which the ADSs trade on the US securities markets. Any dividend we might pay in the future will be denominated in pounds sterling. A decline in the value of the pound sterling against the US dollar would reduce the US dollar equivalent of any such dividend. • Potential volatility of the price of our ordinary shares and ADSs, and the extent to which an investor may lose all or part of their investment The market price for our ordinary shares and ADSs could be volatile and subject to fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, which could lead to losses for our shareholders and ADS holders. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: a) fluctuations in our operating results; b) changes in earnings estimates by analysts; c) announcements by us or our competitors relating to new products, brands or marketing campaigns, or relating to acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures; d) regulations on the production, distribution or marketing of tobacco products; e) additions or departures of key personnel; f) potential litigation, particularly relating to actions which might be brought against us by parties seeking damages for ailments claimed to have resulted from tobacco use; g) anti-trust claims or alleged claims or claims or alleged claims relating to tax liabilities; or h) press, newspaper and other media reports including rumours and speculation in the tobacco sector on potential future consolidation within the industry. 18 Back to Contents GALLAHER GROUP Plc Form 20-F 2005 • Holders of ADSs do not hold their ordinary shares directly and as such may be subject to the following additional risks relating to ADSs rather than ordinary shares (a) In the event of a fluctuation in exchange rates during any period of time when the depositary cannot convert pounds sterling into US dollars for purposes of a dividend or other distribution, an ADS holder may lose some of the dividend or distribution. There can be no assurance that the depositary will be able to convert any currency at a specified exchange rate or sell any property, rights, shares or other securities at a specified price, or that any such transaction can be completed within a specified time period. (b) Upon receipt of a notice from us of a shareholders meeting, the depositary has agreed to provide the holders of ADSs registered on the books of the depositary with any materials that we have distributed, along with a notice as to how each registered ADS holder can instruct the depositary on the voting of the ordinary shares underlying that holders ADSs. We cannot guarantee that ADS holders will receive voting materials in time to instruct the depositary how to vote. It is possible that ADS holders, or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or third parties, will not receive notice of a shareholders meeting or have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote at all. (c) ADS holders may not receive copies of all reports from the depositary or us. An ADS holder may need to go to the depositarys offices to inspect any reports issued. (d) ADS holders may not receive all of the benefits of a holder of ordinary shares, such as rights to participate in any capital increase. (e) Ourselves and the depositary may amend or terminate the deposit agreement without the consent of the ADS holders in a manner that could prejudice ADS holders. • The ability of an ADS holder to bring an action against us may be limited under English law We are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. The rights of holders of ordinary shares and, therefore, many of the rights of ADS holders, are governed by English law, regulatory and non-regulatory requirements and by our Memorandum and Articles of Association. These rights differ from the rights of shareholders in typical US corporations. In particular, English law significantly limits the circumstances under which shareholders of English companies may bring derivative actions. Under English law generally, only our company can be the proper plaintiff in a proceeding in respect of wrongful acts committed against it or claimed to be committed against it. In addition without prejudice, it may be difficult for a US holder to prevail in a claim against us under, or to enforce liabilities predicated upon, US securities laws or doctrines of US laws more generally. • A US holder of ADSs may not be able to enforce a judgment against some of our directors and officers All of our directors and executive officers are residents of countries other than the United States. Consequently, it may not be possible for a US holder to effect service of process within the United States upon them or to enforce against them judgments of courts of the United States based on civil liabilities under the US securities laws. We cannot assure that a US holder will be able to enforce any judgments in civil and commercial matters against our directors or executive officers who are residents of the United Kingdom or other countries other than the United States. We also cannot assure that a US holder will be able to enforce any judgments under the US securities laws against our directors or executive officers who are residents of the United Kingdom or other countries other than the United States. In addition, English or other courts outside the United States may not impose civil liability on our directors or executive officers in any original action based solely on the US securities laws brought against us or our directors in a court of competent jurisdiction in England or other countries outside the United States. 19 Back to Contents GALLAHER GROUP Plc Form 20-F 2005
