ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORSSet forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our shareholders. We refer to the shares of beneficial interest in WRIT as our “common shares,” and the investors who own shares as our “shareholders.” This section includes or refers to certain forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on such forward-looking statements beginning on page 43.Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.Our financial performance and the value of our real estate assets are subject to the risk that if our office, retail and multifamily properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the cash flow generated by our commercial and multifamily properties:•downturns in the national, regional and local economic climate;•the financial health of our tenants and the ability to collect rents;•consumer confidence, unemployment rates and consumer tastes and preferences;•competition from similar asset type properties;•local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, retail and multifamily properties;•changes in interest rates and availability of financing;•vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space;•increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and real estate taxes;•inflation;•civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war; and•decreases in the underlying value of our real estate.We are dependent upon the economic climate of the Washington metropolitan region.All of our properties are located in the Washington metro region, which may expose us to a greater amount of market dependent risk than if we were geographically diverse. General economic conditions and local real estate conditions in the Washington metro region are dependent upon various industries that are predominant in our area (such as government and professional/business services). A downturn in one or more of these industries may have a particularly strong effect on the economic climate of our region. In the event of negative economic changes in our region, we may experience a negative impact to our profitability and may be limited in our ability to meet our financial obligations when due and/or make distributions to our shareholders.We may be adversely affected by any significant reductions in federal government spending.As a REIT operating exclusively in the Washington metro region, a significant portion of our properties is occupied by United States Government tenants or tenants that are directly or indirectly serving the United States Government as federal contractors or otherwise. A significant reduction in federal government spending, particularly a sudden decrease due to the sequestration process, could adversely affect the ability of these tenants to fulfill lease obligations or decrease the likelihood that they will renew their leases with us. Further, economic conditions in the Washington metro region are significantly dependent upon the level of federal government spending in the region. In the event of a significant reduction in federal government spending, there could be negative economic changes in our region which could adversely impact the ability of our tenants to perform their financial obligations under our leases or the likelihood of their lease renewal. As a result, if such a reduction in federal government spending were to occur, we could experience an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our shareholders.We face risks associated with property development/redevelopment.We currently have an active development project to build a mid-rise apartment building at 650 North Glebe Road in Arlington, Virginia, and an active redevelopment project to renovate 7900 Westpark Drive, an office building in McLean, Virginia. We decided to delay commencement of construction of a high-rise multifamily property at 1225 First Street in Alexandria, Virginia due to market conditions and concerns of oversupply.Developing or redeveloping properties presents a number of risks for us, including risks that:•if we are unable to obtain all necessary zoning and other required governmental permits and authorizations or cease development of the project for any other reason, the development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources, resulting in the loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred;•the development and construction costs of the project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and 8increased cost of materials, labor, leasing or other expenditures, which could make the completion of the project less profitable because market rents may not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increase in construction costs;•construction and/or permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or may not be available at all, which may cause the cost of the project to increase and lower the expected return;•the project may not be completed on schedule as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as weather, labor conditions and material shortages, which would result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses; •the time between commencement of a development project and the stabilization of the completed property exposes us to risks associated with fluctuations in the Washington metro region's economic conditions; and•occupancy rates and rents at the completed property may not meet the expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable.Properties developed or acquired for development may generate little or no cash flow from the date of acquisition through the date of completion of development. In addition, new development activities, regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful, may require a substantial portion of management’s time and attention.These risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and, under certain circumstances, could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.We face risks associated with property acquisitions.We intend to continue to acquire properties which would increase our size and could alter our capital structure. Our acquisition activities and results may be exposed to the following risks:•we may be unable to finance acquisitions on favorable terms;•the acquired properties may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investments;•the actual returns realized on acquired properties may not exceed our average cost of capital;•even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property, we may be unable to complete that acquisition after making a non-refundable deposit and incurring certain other acquisition-related costs;•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations;•competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;•our estimates of capital expenditures required for an acquired property, including the costs of repositioning or redeveloping, may be inaccurate;•we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors, including publicly traded real estate investment trusts, institutional investment funds and private investors; and•even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property, it is subject to customary conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations which may have findings that are unacceptable.We may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without recourse, or with limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if liability were asserted against us based upon the acquisition of a property, we may have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to properties acquired might include:•liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;•claims by tenants, vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties; and•liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business.Real estate investments are illiquid, and we may not be able to sell our properties on a timely basis when we determine it is appropriate to do so.Real estate investments can be difficult to sell and convert to cash quickly, especially if market conditions are not favorable, and we may find that to be the case under the current economic conditions due to limited credit availability for potential buyers. Such illiquidity could limit our ability to quickly change our portfolio of properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions. Moreover, under certain circumstances, the Internal Revenue Code imposes penalties on a REIT that sells property held for less than two years and/or sells more than a specified number of properties in a given year. In addition, for properties that we acquire by issuing units in an operating partnership, we may be restricted by agreements with the sellers of the properties for a certain period of time from entering into transactions (such as the sale or refinancing of the acquired property) that will result in a taxable gain to the sellers without the sellers’ consent. Due to these factors, we may be unable to sell a property at an advantageous time.9We may not timely reinvest the proceeds of the sale of our medical office portfolio in properties, which would adversely affect our results of operations and net income.During 2013, we implemented a plan to sell our entire medical office portfolio and completed the final phase of this plan early in 2014. We may not be successful in reinvesting some or all of the proceeds of the sale of medical office portfolio in the near term. If we do not successfully reinvest the sales proceeds promptly in income-producing properties, the resulting decrease in our net income attributable to the controlling interests will not be completely offset by income from the temporary investment of the disposition proceeds. This decrease in net income would have a negative impact on our earnings to fixed charges and debt service coverage ratios and could have a negative impact on our ability to pay dividends at their current level. Even if we promptly reinvest some or all of the sales proceeds in income-producing properties, we still expect some decrease in net income attributable to the controlling interests in future quarters due to the cost of these acquisitions.The sale of our medical office portfolio may require the payment of additional dividends or result in a tax liability for the taxable gains on the sold properties.We have identified a portion of the sold Medical Office Portfolio properties for tax deferred exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 1031 requires that we identify and close on the acquisition of replacement properties within limited time periods. We may not be able to identify and acquire appropriate replacement properties within the specified time periods. If we do not identify and acquire the replacement properties within the specified time periods, we would expect to recognize a taxable gain with respect to the sale of the Medical Office Portfolio. The amount of this taxable gain would depend upon the timing and size of the replacement property acquisitions and also our other results of operations, and it could be a material amount. If we recognize this taxable gain, we could be required to pay a significant portion of it as a special capital gain dividend to our shareholders or alternatively be subject to income taxes on the taxable gain. Funds used to pay capital gains to our shareholders or tax liabilities would not be available for reinvestment in properties, potentially decreasing our net income, negatively impacting our earnings to fixed charges and debt service coverage ratios and negatively impacting our ability to pay future dividends at their current level. Further, it is possible that the qualification of a transaction as a Section 1031 exchange could be successfully challenged and determined to be currently taxable. In this event, our taxable income would increase. This could require us to pay additional dividends or, in lieu of that, income taxes, possibly including interest and penalties. We face potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re-leasing space.As of December 31, 2013, leases on our commercial properties classified as continuing operations will expire as follows: % of leased square footage201412%201515%201611%201713%20188%2019 and thereafter41%Total100%Multifamily properties are leased under operating leases with terms of generally one year or less. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the multifamily tenant retention rate was 43%, 61% and 56%, respectively. We derive substantially all of our income from rent received from tenants. If our tenants decide not to renew their leases, we may not be able to release the space. If tenants decide to renew their leases, the terms of renewals, including the cost of required improvements or concessions, may be less favorable than current lease terms. As a result of the foregoing, our cash flow could decrease and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected.We face potential adverse effects from major tenants' bankruptcies or insolvencies.The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may adversely affect the income produced by a property. We cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. On the other hand, a court might authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease. In such case, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid, future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease. As a result, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. This shortfall could adversely affect our cash flow and results from operations. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business 10or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely rental payments.We may suffer economic harm as a result of the actions of our partners in real estate joint ventures and other investments.We invest in joint ventures in which we are not the exclusive investor or the only decision maker. Investments in such entities may involve risks not present when a third party is not involved, including the possibility that the other parties to these investments might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Our partners in these entities may have economic, tax or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments may also lead to impasses, for example, as to whether to sell a property, because neither we nor the other parties to these investments may have full control over the entity. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of the other parties to these investments. Each of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our shareholders.Our properties face significant competition.We face significant competition from developers, owners and operators of office, retail, multifamily and other commercial real estate. Substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market. Such competition may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents we are able to charge. These competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties, which may result in their owners being willing to make space available at lower rents than the space in our properties.We are dependent on key personnel. The execution of our investment strategy, and management of our operations, depend to a significant degree on our senior management team. If we are unable to attract and retain skilled executives, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.We cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at current rates.Cash flows from operations are an important factor in our ability to sustain our dividend at its current rate. If our cash flows from operations were to decline significantly, we may have to borrow on our lines of credit to sustain the dividend rate or further reduce our dividend, as we did in the third quarter of 2012. Our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at its current rate or to increase our common share dividend rate will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the following:•our future financial condition and results of operations;•real estate market conditions in the Washington metro region;•the performance of lease terms by tenants;•the terms of our loan covenants; and•our ability to acquire, finance, develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates.Our board of trustees considers, among other factors, trends in our levels of funds from operations, together with associated recurring capital improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and incentives, and adjustments to straight-line rents to reflect cash rents received. This level has trended lower in recent years due to the recent economic downturn and uncertainty with the business and leasing environment in the Washington metro region. As noted above, we reduced our dividend rate, and if such trend were to continue for a sustained period of time, our board of trustees could determine to further reduce our dividend rate. If we do not maintain or increase the dividend rate on our common shares in the future, it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares.We face risks associated with the use of debt, including refinancing risk.We rely on borrowings under our credit facilities and offerings of debt securities to finance acquisitions and development activities and for general corporate purposes. In the recent past, the commercial real estate debt markets have experienced significant volatility due to a number of factors, including the tightening of underwriting standards by lenders and credit rating agencies and the reported significant inventory of unsold mortgage backed securities in the market. The volatility resulted in investors decreasing the availability of debt financing as well as increasing the cost of debt financing. We believe that circumstances could again arise in which we may not be able to obtain debt financing in the future on favorable terms, or at all. If we were unable to borrow under our credit facilities or to refinance existing debt financing, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected.We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt, including the risk that our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to 11maturity. Therefore, we are likely to need to refinance a significant portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt. If principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as new equity capital, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant “balloon” payments come due.Our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our common shares or debt securities.On February 26, 2014, our total consolidated debt was approximately $1.1 billion. Consolidated debt to consolidated market capitalization ratio, which measures total consolidated debt as a percentage of the aggregate of total consolidated debt plus the market value of outstanding equity securities, is often used by analysts to assess leverage for equity REITs such as us. Our market value is calculated using the price per share of our common shares. Using the closing share price of $24.86 per share of our common shares on February 26, 2014, multiplied by the number of our common shares, our consolidated debt to total consolidated market capitalization ratio was approximately 40% as of February 26, 2014.Our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. Our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by two major rating agencies. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this rating, and in the event our senior debt is downgraded from its current rating, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and/or difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Our degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally. There is a risk that changes in our debt to market capitalization ratio, which is in part a function of our share price, or our ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts, may have an adverse effect on the market price of our equity or debt securities.Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing or have other adverse effects on us or the market price of our common shares.The United States and global equity and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility and liquidity disruptions which caused the market prices of stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances significantly and negatively impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive or unavailable. Any disruption in the equity and credit markets could negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms or at all. If such disruption were to occur, in the event of a debt financing, our cost of borrowing in the future would likely be significantly higher than historical levels. Additionally, in the case of a common equity financing, the disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common shares, potentially requiring us to issue more shares than we would otherwise have issued with a higher market value for our common shares. Disruption in the financial markets also could negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions, undertake new development projects and refinance our debt. In addition, it could also make it more difficult for us to sell properties and could adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers experience increased costs of financing and difficulties in obtaining financing.Disruptions in the financial markets also could adversely affect many of our tenants and their businesses, including their ability to pay rents when due and renew their leases at rates at least as favorable as their current rates. As well, our ability to attract prospective new tenants in the future could be adversely affected by disruption in the financial markets.Rising interest rates would increase our interest costs.We may incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service debt. As a protection against rising interest rates, we may enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate exchange contracts. These agreements, however, increase our risks that other parties to the agreements may not perform or that the agreements may be unenforceable.Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition.Our credit facilities contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness. We must maintain a minimum tangible net worth and certain ratios, including a maximum of total liabilities to total gross asset value, a maximum of secured indebtedness to gross asset value, a minimum of quarterly EBITDA to fixed charges, a minimum of unencumbered asset value to unsecured indebtedness, a minimum of net operating income from unencumbered properties to unsecured interest expense and a maximum of permitted investments to gross asset value. Our ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject to compliance with our financial and other covenants. 12Failure to comply with any of the covenants under our unsecured credit facilities or other debt instruments could result in a default under one or more of our debt instruments. In particular, we could suffer a default under one of our secured debt instruments that could exceed a cross default threshold under our unsecured credit facilities, causing an event of default under the unsecured credit facilities. Alternatively, even if a secured debt instrument is below the cross default threshold for non-recourse secured debt under our unsecured credit facilities, a default under such secured debt instrument may still cause a cross default under our unsecured credit facilities because such secured debt instrument may not qualify as “non-recourse” under the definition in our unsecured credit facilities. Another possible cross default could occur between our unsecured credit facilities and our senior unsecured notes. Any of the foregoing default or cross default events could cause our lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and/or prohibit future borrowings, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity.We face risks associated with short-term liquid investments.We have significant cash balances periodically that we invest in a variety of short-term investments that are intended to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income. From time to time, these investments may include (either directly or indirectly):•direct obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury;•obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies;•taxable municipal securities;•obligations (including certificates of deposit) of banks and thrifts;•commercial paper and other instruments consisting of short-term U.S. dollar denominated obligations issued by corporations and banks;•repurchase agreements collateralized by corporate and asset-backed obligations;•registered and unregistered money market funds; and•other highly-rated short-term securities.Investments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss of principal. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to redeem all or part of our investment, and our right to redeem some or all of our investment may be delayed or suspended. In addition, there is no guarantee that our investments in these securities or funds will be redeemable at par value. A decline in the value of our investment or a delay or suspension of our right to redeem may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.Further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current shareholders.The interests of our existing shareholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued, including to finance future developments and acquisitions, instead of incurring additional debt. Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt and equity financing.Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other laws and regulations could result in substantial costs.The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that public buildings, including commercial and multifamily properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If, pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our results of operations.We may also incur significant costs complying with other regulations. Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fair housing, rent control and fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we may incur fines or private damage awards. We believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with regulatory requirements. However, we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will adversely affect our results of operations.Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.We carry insurance coverage on our properties of types and in amounts that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties. We believe all of our properties are adequately insured. The property insurance that we maintain for our properties has historically been on an “all risk” basis, which is in full force and effect until renewal in August 2014. There are other types of losses, such as from wars or catastrophic events, for which we cannot obtain insurance at all or at 13a reasonable cost.We have an insurance policy that has no terrorism exclusion, except for non-certified nuclear, chemical and biological acts of terrorism. Our financial condition and results of operations are subject to the risks associated with acts of terrorism and the potential for uninsured losses as the result of any such acts. Effective November 26, 2002, under this existing coverage, any losses caused by certified acts of terrorism would be partially reimbursed by the United States under a formula established by federal law. Under this formula, the United States pays 85% of covered terrorism losses exceeding the statutorily established deductible paid by the insurance provider, and insurers pay 10% until aggregate insured losses from all insurers reach $100 billion in a calendar year. If the aggregate amount of insured losses under this program exceeds $100 billion during the applicable period for all insured and insurers combined, then each insurance provider will not be liable for payment of any amount which exceeds the aggregate amount of $100 billion. On December 26, 2007, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 was signed into law and extends the program through December 31, 2014. We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism in particular, but we cannot anticipate what amount of coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.In the event of an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insurance limits, we could lose both the revenues generated from the affected property and the capital we have invested in the affected property. Depending on the specific circumstances of the affected property it is possible that we could be liable for any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any such loss could adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations.In most cases, we have to renew our policies on an annual basis and negotiate acceptable terms for coverage, exposing us to the volatility of the insurance markets, including the possibility of rate increases. Any material increase in insurance rates or decrease in available coverage in the future could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties.All of our properties are located in or near Washington D.C., a metropolitan area that has been and may in the future be the target of actual or threatened terrorism attacks. As a result, some tenants in our market may choose to relocate their businesses to other markets. This could result in an overall decrease in the demand for commercial space in this market generally, which could increase vacancies in our properties or necessitate that we lease our properties on less favorable terms, or both. In addition, future terrorist attacks in or near Washington D.C. could directly or indirectly damage our properties, both physically and financially, or cause losses that materially exceed our insurance coverage. As a result of the foregoing, our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties could decline materially.Potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs.Under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at our properties, regardless of our knowledge or responsibility, simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other state and local governmental authorities are increasingly involved in indoor air quality standards, especially with respect to asbestos, mold, medical waste and lead-based paint. The clean up of any environmental contamination, including asbestos and mold, can be costly. If environmental problems arise, we may have to make substantial payments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations because:•as owner or operator we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination;•the law typically imposes clean-up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination;•even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination, each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs; and•governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs.These costs could be substantial and, in extreme cases, could exceed the value of the contaminated property. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. In addition, applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with a contamination.Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos. Such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos:•properly manage and maintain the asbestos;•notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos; and14•undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building.Such laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct Phase I environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to our acquisition of properties. These assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas, an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state, federal and historical documents. However, they do not always involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling. When appropriate, on a property-by-property basis, our general practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing. However, even though these additional assessments may be conducted, there is still the risk that:•the environmental assessments and updates did not identify all potential environmental liabilities;•a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments;•new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted; and•future uses or conditions or changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability to us.Breaches of data security could materially harm our business and reputation.In the normal course of business we collect and retain certain personal information provided by our tenants and employees. While we employ a variety of data security measures to protect the confidentiality of this information and periodically review and improve our data security measures, we cannot assure that we will be able to prevent unauthorized access to this personal information. Any breach of our data security measures and loss of this personal information may result in legal liability and costs (including damages and penalties), as well as damage to our reputation, that could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance. Failure to qualify as a REIT would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends.If we fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we would be taxed as a corporation. We believe that we are organized and qualified as a REIT and intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, we cannot assure you that we are qualified as such, or that we will remain qualified as such in the future. This is because qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as to which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control. Future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we could face serious tax consequences that could substantially reduce our funds available for payment of dividends for each of the years involved because:•we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income and could be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;•we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes;•unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we are disqualified; and•all dividends would be subject to tax as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits potentially eligible as “qualified dividends” subject to the applicable income tax rate.In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would no longer be required to pay dividends. As a result of these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The market value of our securities can be adversely affected by many factors.As with any public company, a number of factors may adversely influence the public market price of our common shares. These factors include:•level of institutional interest in us;•perceived attractiveness of investment in us, in comparison to other REITs;•attractiveness of securities of REITs in comparison to other asset classes taking into account, among other things, that a substantial portion of REITs’ dividends are taxed as ordinary income;•our financial condition and performance;15•the market’s perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends;•government action or regulation, including changes in tax law;•increases in market interest rates, which may lead investors to expect a higher annual yield from our distributions in relation to the price of our shares;•changes in federal tax laws;•changes in our credit ratings; and•any negative change in the level of our dividend or the partial payment thereof in common shares.Provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law may limit a change in control.There are several provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or the MGCL, that may limit the ability of a third party to undertake a change in control, including:•a provision where a corporation is not permitted to engage in any business combination with any “interested stockholder,” defined as any holder or affiliate of any holder of 10% or more of the corporation’s stock, for a period of five years after that holder becomes an “interested stockholder;” and•a provision where the voting rights of “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition,” as defined in the MGCL, may be restricted, such that the “control shares” have no voting rights, except to the extent approved by a vote of holders of two-thirds of the common shares entitled to vote on the matter.These provisions may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction or a change in control that may involve a premium price for holders of our shares or otherwise be in their best interests. Our bylaws currently provide that the foregoing provision regarding "control share acquisitions" will not apply to WRIT. However, our board of trustees could, in the future, modify our bylaws such that the foregoing provision regarding "control share acquisitions" would be applicable to WRIT.ITEM 1B: UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.16
