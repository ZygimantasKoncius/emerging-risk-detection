Item 1A. Risk Factors. For a discussion of certain risks associated with our business, the industry in which we operate and the ownership interests of holders of our Common Stock and other equity securities, and other considerations that may affect our results of operations and financial condition, please see the section entitled Cautionary Statements and Risk Factors in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 below. 14 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments We have on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a pending registration statement on Form S-3 that we filed to register for resale certain shares of our Common Stock that were issued in connection with various private placements or are issuable upon conversion of certain of our privately placed outstanding convertible securities. We have received from the Staff of the SEC written comments pertaining to such registration statement and to certain current and periodic reports previously filed under the Exchange Act that we are in the process of responding to and resolving as part of the registration process. We believe that these unresolved comments are not material to our results of operations or financial condition. However, there can be no assurance that the Staff of the SEC will concur in our assessment.
