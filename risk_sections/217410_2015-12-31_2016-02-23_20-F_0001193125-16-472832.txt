D. RISK FACTORS Our principal risks, as described on pages 40 and 41 of the Groups Annual Report and Accounts 2015 furnished separately on 23 February 2016 under Form 6-K, excluding the cross-reference to pages 53 to 57, are incorporated by reference. Our business is subject to risks and uncertainties. The risks that we regard as the most relevant to our business are set out on pages 40 to 41 of the Groups Annual Report and Accounts 2015 furnished separately on 23 February 2016 under Form 6-K. These are the risks that we see as material to Unilevers business and performance at this time. There may be other risks that could emerge in the future. We have undertaken certain mitigating actions that we believe help us to manage the risks identified. However, we may not be successful in deploying some or all of these mitigating actions. If the circumstances in these risk factors occur or are not successfully mitigated, our cash flow, operating results, financial position, business and reputation could be materially adversely affected. In addition, risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to vary from those described in this document, or could impact on our ability to meet our targets or be detrimental to our profitability or reputation. The list is not intended to be exhaustive and there may be other risks and uncertainties that are not mentioned that could impact our future performance or our ability to meet published targets. The risks and uncertainties should be read in conjunction with the Groups consolidated financial statements and related notes and the portions of the Strategic Report and Corporate Governance section that are incorporated by reference from the Groups Annual Report and Accounts 2015 furnished separately on 23 February 2016 on Form 6-K and other information included in or incorporated by reference in this report on Form 20-F.
