D. RISK FACTORS INVESTING IN OUR ORDINARY SHARES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW BEFORE INVESTING IN OUR ORDINARY SHARES. OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED DUE TO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS. IN THAT CASE, THE VALUE OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES COULD DECLINE, AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY WE HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE OR SUSTAIN PROFITABILITY IN THE FUTURE. In the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a net loss of approximately $5.0 million. We have incurred losses in three out of the last five years and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. 5 WE HAVE A HISTORY OF QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND EXPECT THESE FLUCTUATIONS TO CONTINUE. We have experienced and in the future may continue to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and we expect these fluctuations to continue. Factors that may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations include: o The size and timing of orders; o The high level of competition that we encounter; o The timing of our product introductions or enhancements or those of our competitors or of providers of complementary products; o Market acceptance of our new products, applications and services; o The purchasing patterns and budget cycles of our customers and end-users; o Seasonality in our revenues, with the third quarter typically having lower levels of revenues due to the summer months in Europe; o The mix of product sales; o Exchange rate fluctuations; and o General economic conditions. Our customers ordinarily require the delivery of products promptly after we accept their orders. With the exception of contracts for services, we usually do not have a significant backlog of orders for our products. Consequently, revenues from our products in any quarter depend on orders received and accepted by the customers in that quarter. The deferral of the placing and acceptance of any large order from one quarter to another could materially adversely affect our results of operations for the former quarter. Our customers sometimes require an acceptance test for services we provide and as a result, we may have a significant backlog of orders for our services. Our revenues from services depend on orders received and services provided by us and accepted by our customers in that quarter. If sales in any quarter do not increase correspondingly or if we do not reduce our expenses in response to level or declining revenues in a timely fashion, our financial results for that quarter would be materially adversely affected. For these reasons, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on the results of our operations in any particular quarter as an indication of future performance. CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE WORLD MARKETS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. Our financial statements are stated in U.S. dollars, our functional currency. Nevertheless, a substantial portion of our sales and expenses are incurred in other currencies, particularly Euros, Japanese yen, NIS and the British pound. We maintain substantial non-U.S. dollar balances of assets, including cash and accounts receivable, and liabilities, including accounts payable. Fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we do business relative to the U.S. dollar may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, by decreasing the U.S. dollar value of assets held in other currencies and increasing the U.S. dollar amount of liabilities payable in other currencies. From time to time we use derivative or other instruments to hedge against part or all of our exposures. OUR WIDESPREAD OPERATIONS MAY STRAIN OUR MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. Our widespread operations have significantly strained our management, operational and financial resources in the past. Any future growth may increase this strain. To manage future growth effectively, we must: 6 o Expand our operational, management, financial, marketing and research and development functions; o Train, motivate, manage and retain qualified employees; and o Hire additional personnel. We may not succeed in managing future growth. WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE MARKETS FOR OUR APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES, WHICH ARE EVOLVING INTO A NEW UNIFIED MARKET FOR COMPOSITE APPLICATIONS DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT. Many companies compete with us in the areas of software development tools, business integration and business process management, or BPM, tools, and in the applications and services markets in which we operate. We expect that competition will increase in the future, both with respect to our technology, applications and services which we currently offer and applications and services which we and other vendors are developing. Increased competition, direct and indirect, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Many of our existing and potential competitors are far larger, have substantially greater resources including financial, technological, marketing, skilled human resources and distribution capabilities, and enjoy greater market recognition than us. We may not be able to differentiate our products from those of our competitors, offer our products as part of integrated systems or solutions to the same extent as our competitors, or successfully develop or introduce new products that are more cost-effective, or offer better performance than our competitors. Failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. WE MAY NOT SUCCEED IN INCREASING OUR MARKET SHARE IN THE BUSINESS INTEGRATION AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT MARKETS WITH OUR IBOLT PRODUCTS, OR LEVERAGE OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE COMPOSITE APPLICATIONS FIELD. During 2003, we launched the iBOLT Integration Suite, which provides business integration and process management solutions to mid-size and large organizations. In 2004, we launched iBOLT Version 2.0, and in 2005 we released both iBOLT Version 2.5 and iBOLT Special Edition for SAP Business One. We are currently developing the next release of iBOLT, which we expect to release during the latter part of 2007. The business integration and BPM markets in which we compete are extremely competitive and subject to rapid changes. Our competitors utilize varying approaches to the provision of technology to business integration and BPM markets. We may not have the resources, skills and product variety required to successfully increase our market share in these markets. We do not have a long history of selling products in the business integration and process management markets and we will have to devote substantial resources to educating prospective customers and the market about our products' benefits. In addition, even if we succeed in convincing prospective customers and the market that our products are effective and provide real business benefits, our target customers may not choose them for technical, cost, support or other reasons. To succeed in these markets, we will need to: o Further develop and improve our expertise in marketing and selling integration technology; o Recruit, develop and cultivate additional system integrators who will serve as market and sales channels of integration projects for prospective customers; and o Effectively establish and enhance relationships with technological partners and application vendors, which will extend our value proposition and assist us in reaching more customers. 7 OUR FUTURE SUCCESS WILL BE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE ACCEPTANCE OF FUTURE RELEASES OF OUR EDEVELOPER APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT PRODUCT. Our future success will be in great measure dependent on the acceptance of future releases of our eDeveloper application development and deployment product. The acceptance of this product relies in part on the continued acceptance and growth of diverse platforms, systems and databases, where eDeveloper operates as the bridge for creating composite applications. In the future, organizations may not implement multiple environments to serve their computing needs. CHANGES IN THE RATIO OF OUR REVENUES GENERATED FROM DIFFERENT REVENUE ELEMENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGINS. We derive our revenues from the sale of software licenses, applications, maintenance and technical support and consulting services. Our gross margin is affected by the proportion of our revenues generated from the sale of each of those elements of our revenues. Our revenues from the sale of our software licenses and maintenance and technical support have higher gross margins than our revenues from the sale of consulting services. If the relative proportion of our revenues from the sale of consulting services increases as a percentage of our total revenues, our gross profit margins will decline. Our software licenses revenues include the sale of the third party software license sales, which have a lower gross margin than the sales of our software products. Any increase in the portion of third party software license sales out of total license sales will decrease our gross profit margin. WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS WHO ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS. We sell our products through our direct sales representatives, as well as through third parties that use our technology to develop solutions for their customers, referred to as Magic solution providers, and independent distributors. These independent distributors then resell our products to end-users. We are dependent upon the acceptance of our products by our independent distributors and their active marketing and sales efforts. Typically, our arrangements with our independent distributors do not require them to purchase specified amounts of products or prevent them from selling non-competitive products. The independent distributors may not continue, or may not give a high priority to, marketing and supporting our products. Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the financial condition, business, marketing strategies, local and global economic conditions, or results of our independent distributors. WE MAY LOSE INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS ON WHOM WE CURRENTLY DEPEND AND WE MAY NOT SUCCEED IN DEVELOPING NEW DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. If any of our distribution relationships are terminated, we may not be successful in replacing them on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, we will need to develop new sales channels for new products, and we may not succeed in doing so. Any changes in our distribution and sales channels, particularly the loss of a major distributor, or our inability to establish effective distribution and sales channels for new markets, will impact our ability to sell our products and result in a loss of revenues and profits. OUR EFFORTS TO INCREASE OUR PRESENCE IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND ASSIA MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE. Our success in becoming a stronger competitor in the sale of software development and deployment technology and a leading provider of applications is dependent upon our ability to increase our sales in the United States, Europe and Japan. Our efforts to increase our penetration to these markets are subject to risks inherent to such markets, including the high cost of doing business in such locations. 8 OUR PRODUCTS HAVE A LENGTHY SALES CYCLE. Our customers typically use our technology to develop, deploy and integrate applications that are critical to their businesses. As a result, the licensing and implementation of our technology generally involves a significant commitment of attention and resources by prospective customers. Because of the long approval process that typically accompanies strategic initiatives or capital expenditures by companies, our sales process is often delayed, with little or no control over any delays encountered by us. Our sales cycle can be further extended for sales made through third party distributors. RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. We compete in a market that is characterized by rapid technological change. The introduction of new technologies could render existing products and services obsolete and unmarketable and could exert price pressures on our products and services. Our future success will depend upon our ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by: o Supporting existing and emerging hardware, software, databases and networking platforms; and o Developing and introducing new and enhanced software development technology and applications that keep pace with such technological developments, emerging new markets and changing customer requirements. If release dates of any future products or enhancements are delayed or if, when released, they fail to achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN QUALIFIED ENGINEERING, ADMINISTRATIVE, OPERATIONAL, SALES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT PERSONNEL. In the event our business grows, we will need to hire additional qualified engineering, administrative, operational, sales and technical support personnel. The process of locating, training and successfully integrating qualified personnel into our operations can be lengthy and expensive. We may not be able to compete effectively for the personnel we need. Competition for these employees in the industry in which we operate is intense around the world, especially in Israel, India and the United States. Any loss of members of senior management or key technical personnel, or any failure to attract or retain highly qualified employees as needed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. OUR PRODUCTS MAY CONTAIN DEFECTS THAT MAY BE COSTLY TO CORRECT, DELAY MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND EXPOSE US TO DIFFICULTIES IN THE COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES AND TO LITIGATION. Despite quality assurance testing performed by us, as well as by Magic solution providers and end-users who participate in our beta-testing programs, errors may be found in our software products or in applications developed with our technology. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that a significant percentage of the applications developed with our technology were and are likely to continue to be developed by Magic solution providers over whom we exercise no supervision or control. If defects are discovered, we may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all. Defects and failures in our products could result in a loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products, as well as difficulties in the collection of receivables and litigation, and could damage our reputation. Our standard license agreement with our customers contains provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims that may not be effective or enforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions. Accordingly, we could fail to realize revenues and suffer damage to our reputation as a result of, or in defense of, a substantial claim. WE RELY ON THIRD PARTY TECHNOLOGY LICENSES. We incorporate software that we license from third parties into our technology. If we lose, or are unable to maintain any software licenses, we could suffer harm until equivalent software can be developed, identified, licensed and integrated. Loss of third party software licensing would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 9 OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY IS DIFFICULT TO PROTECT AND UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY BY THIRD PARTIES MAY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY. Our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of trade secret and copyright laws and confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment-of-inventions agreements to protect our proprietary technology. We do not have any patents. Our policy is to require employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These measures may not be adequate to protect our technology from third-party infringement, and our competitors might independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours. Additionally, our products may be sold in foreign countries that provide less protection for intellectual property rights than that provided under U.S. or Israeli laws. THIRD PARTIES MAY CLAIM THAT WE INFRINGE UPON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us or claims that we have violated a patent or infringed upon a copyright, trademark or other proprietary right belonging to them. Any infringement claim, even one without merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources to defend any such claims. WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND SALES. While our principal executive offices are located in Israel, 95% of our sales in 2004 and 93% of our sales in 2005 and 2006 were generated from other countries. This subjects us to many risks inherent to international business activities, including: o Limitations and disruptions resulting from the imposition of government controls; o Changes in regulatory requirements; o Export license requirements; o Economic or political instability; o Trade restrictions; o Changes in tariffs; o Currency fluctuations; o Difficulties in the collection of receivables; o Greater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property; and o Difficulties in managing overseas subsidiaries and international operations. We may encounter significant difficulties in connection with the sale of our products in international markets as a result of one or more of these factors. 10 WE ARE CONTROLLED BY FORMULA SYSTEMS (1985) LTD. Formula Systems (1985) Ltd., whose shares trade on the NASDAQ Global Market and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, or TASE, directly owns 15,750,989 or 50.10% of our outstanding ordinary shares. Formula Systems Ltd. is and may continue to be in a position to exercise control over most matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of our directors, approval of significant corporate transactions and the general ability to direct our affairs. Such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. COMPLIANCE WITH CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REGULATIONS COULD INCREASE THE COST OF OUR OPERATIONS. As a result of certain corporate governance scandals and the legislative and litigation environment resulting from those scandals, the costs of being a public company in general have increased in recent years. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure or compliance practices. We expect that the on-going implementation of these regulations will further increase our accounting and legal compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming. We are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result of such developments. When we are required to implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which governs internal controls and procedures for financial reporting, we will need to expend significant management time and financial resources to comply with the applicable requirements. This and other proposed legislation may increase the fees of our professional advisors and our insurance premiums. RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR ORDINARY SHARES OUR SHARE PRICE HAS BEEN VERY VOLATILE IN THE PAST AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SIGNIFICANT MARKET PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FUTURE. Our ordinary shares have experienced significant market price and volume fluctuations in the past and may experience significant market price and volume fluctuations in the future in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control: o Quarterly variations in our operating results; o Operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors; o Changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors; o Announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors; o Announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; o Changes in the status of our intellectual property rights; o Announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us; o Additions or departures of key personnel; o Future sales of our ordinary shares; o Stock market price and volume fluctuations; and o General trends of the stock markets. Domestic and international stock markets often experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions, such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations or political events or hostilities in or surrounding Israel, could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares. 11 In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the targets of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR ORDINARY SHARES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future under our current financial condition. Future dividend distributions are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, tax implications of dividend distributions on our income, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. The distribution of dividends also may be limited by Israeli law, which permits the distribution of dividends only out of profits (as defined by Israeli law) or otherwise upon the permission of the court. You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investment. The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our ordinary shares, which is uncertain and unpredictable. There is no guarantee that our ordinary shares will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased your ordinary shares. OUR ORDINARY SHARES ARE TRADED ON MORE THAN ONE MARKET AND THIS MAY RESULT IN PRICE VARIATIONS. Our ordinary shares are traded primarily on the NASDAQ Global Market and on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Trading in our ordinary shares on these markets is made in different currencies (U.S. dollars on the NASDAQ Global Market, and New Israeli Shekels, or NIS, on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange), and at different times (resulting from different time zones, different trading days and different public holidays in the United States and Israel). Consequently, the trading prices of our ordinary shares on these two markets may differ. Any decrease in the trading price of our ordinary shares on one of these markets could cause a decrease in the trading price of our ordinary shares on the other market. RISKS RELATING TO OUR LOCATION IN ISRAEL CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN ISRAEL ENTAILS SPECIAL RISKS. We are incorporated under the laws of, and our executive offices and research and development facilities are located in, the State of Israel. Although most of our sales are made to customers outside Israel, we are influenced to a limited extent by the political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel. Specifically, we could be adversely affected by any major hostilities involving Israel, or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and a state of hostility, varying from time to time in intensity and degree, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Although Israel has entered into various agreements with Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority, there has been an increase in unrest and terrorist activity in Israel, which began in September 2000 and which has continued with varying levels of severity through 2006. In July 2006, an armed conflict began between Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon, which involved rocket attacks on populated areas in the northern parts of Israel. On August 14, 2006, a cease-fire between Hezbollah and Israel took effect. This situation has had an adverse effect on Israel's economy, primarily in the geographical areas directly harmed by this conflict. Any future armed conflict, political instability or violence in the region may have a negative effect on those research and development activities that we conduct in Israel and may adversely affect our share price. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE OBLIGATION OF OUR PERSONNEL TO PERFORM MILITARY SERVICE. Many of our executive officers and employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israeli Defense Forces and may be called for active duty under emergency circumstances at any time. If a military conflict or war arises, these individuals could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time. Our operations could be disrupted by the absence for a significant period of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or a significant number of other employees due to military service. Any disruption in our operations could adversely affect our business. 12 WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE RATE OF INFLATION IN ISRAEL EXCEEDS THE RATE OF DEVALUATION OF THE NEW ISRAELI SHEKEL AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. A portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses, is incurred in NIS. As a result, we are exposed to the risk that the rate of inflation in Israel will exceed the rate of devaluation of the NIS in relation to the U.S. dollar or that the timing of this devaluation lags behind inflation in Israel. In 2004 and 2006, the U.S. dollar devaluated against the NIS by 1.6% and 8.2%, respectively, while in 2005, the U.S. dollar appreciated against the NIS by 6.8%. We may be materially and adversely affected in the future if the rate of inflation in Israel exceeds the devaluation of the NIS against the U.S. dollar or if the timing of this devaluation lags behind increases in inflation in Israel. WE CURRENTLY BENEFIT FROM GOVERNMENT TAX BENEFITS, WHICH MAY BE DISCONTINUED OR REDUCED IN THE FUTURE. We are currently eligible to receive tax benefits under Government of Israel programs. In order to maintain our eligibility for these tax benefits, we must continue to meet specific conditions, including making specified investments in fixed assets. If we or our subsidiary fail to comply with these conditions in the future, the tax benefits received could be canceled and we could also be required to pay significantly increased taxes for prior years and for the future. SERVICE AND ENFORCEMENT OF LEGAL PROCESS ON US AND OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. We are incorporated in Israel and some of our directors, executive officers and the Israeli experts named in this annual report reside outside the United States. Service of process upon them may be difficult to effect within the United States. Furthermore, most of our assets and the assets of some of our executive officers and directors and some of the experts named in this annual report are located outside the United States. Therefore, a judgment obtained against us or any of them in the United States, including one based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States and may not be enforced by an Israeli court. It also may be difficult for you to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel. For more information regarding the enforceability of civil liabilities against us, our directors and executive officers and the Israeli experts named in this prospectus, including the terms under which certain judgments may be enforced by an Israeli court, please see "Enforceability of Civil Liabilities." PROVISIONS OF ISRAELI LAW MAY DELAY, PREVENT OR MAKE DIFFICULT AN ACQUISITION OF US, WHICH COULD PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL AND THEREFORE DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR SHARES. Israeli corporate law regulates mergers, requires tender offers for acquisitions of shares above specified thresholds, requires special approvals for transactions involving directors, officers or significant shareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to these types of transactions. Furthermore, Israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions unappealing to us or to some of our shareholders. These provisions of Israeli corporate and tax law may have the effect of delaying, preventing or complicating a merger with, or other acquisition of, us. This could cause our ordinary shares to trade at prices below the price for which third parties might be willing to pay to gain control of us. Third parties who are otherwise willing to pay a premium over prevailing market prices to gain control of us may be unable or unwilling to do so because of these provisions of Israeli law. 13 YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS A SHAREHOLDER WILL BE GOVERNED BY ISRAELI LAW AND DIFFER IN SOME RESPECTS FROM THE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF SHAREHOLDERS UNDER U.S. LAW. We are incorporated under Israeli law. The rights and responsibilities of holders of our ordinary shares are governed by our memorandum of association, articles of association and by Israeli law. These rights and responsibilities differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders in typical U.S. corporations. In particular, a shareholder of an Israeli company has a duty to act in good faith in exercising his or her rights and fulfilling his or her obligations toward the company and other shareholders and to refrain from abusing his power in the company, including, among other things, in voting at the general meeting of shareholders on certain matters. Israeli law provides that these duties are applicable in shareholder votes at the general meeting with respect to, among other things, amendments to a company's articles of association, increases in a company's authorized share capital, mergers and actions and transactions involving interests of officers, directors or other interested parties which require the shareholders' general meeting's approval. In addition, a controlling shareholder of an Israeli company or a shareholder who knows that he or she possesses the power to determine the outcome of a vote at a meeting of our shareholders, or who has, by virtue of the company's articles of association, the power to appoint or prevent the appointment of an office holder in the company, or any other power with respect to the company, has a duty of fairness toward the company. The Israeli Companies Law does not establish criteria for determining whether or not a shareholder has acted in good faith. Moreover, the law is relatively new and there is no case law available on the duty of a non-controlling shareholder to act in good faith. AS A FOREIGN PRIVATE ISSUER WHOSE SHARES ARE LISTED ON THE NASDAQ GLOBAL MARKET, WE MAY FOLLOW CERTAIN HOME COUNTRY CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES INSTEAD OF CERTAIN NASDAQ REQUIREMENTS. As a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, we are permitted to follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of certain requirements of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. A foreign private issuer that elects to follow a home country practice instead of such requirements, must submit to NASDAQ in advance a written statement from an independent counsel in such issuer's home country certifying that the issuer's practices are not prohibited by the home country's laws. In addition, a foreign private issuer must disclose in its annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission each such requirement that it does not follow and describe the home country practice followed by the issuer instead of any such requirement. As a foreign private issuer listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, we may follow home country practice with regard to, among other things, composition of the board of directors, director nomination procedure, compensation of officers, and quorum at shareholders' meetings. In addition, we may follow our home country law, instead of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, which require that we obtain shareholder approval for certain dilutive events, such as for the establishment or amendment of certain equity based compensation plans, an issuance that will result in a change of control of the company, certain transactions other than a public offering involving issuances of a 20% or more interest in the company and certain acquisitions of the stock or assets of another company.
