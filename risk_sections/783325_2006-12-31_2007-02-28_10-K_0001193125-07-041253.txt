ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - (Contd) alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited, the additional competitive pressures resulting from retail access could lead to a loss of customers and our incurring stranded costs. FERC continues to support the existing RTOs that affect the structure of the wholesale market within those RTOs. In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO implemented the MISO Midwest Market on April 1, 2005. The MISO Midwest Market rules require that all market participants submit day-ahead and/or real-time bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region. MISO then calculates the most efficient solution for all of the bids and offers made into the market that day and establishes a LMP that reflects the market price for energy. As a participant in the MISO Midwest Market, we are required to follow MISOs instructions when dispatching generating units to support MISOs responsibility for maintaining stability of the transmission system. Additionally, the MISO Midwest Market subjects us to additional costs primarily associated with constraints in the transmission system. MISO implemented the LMP system, a market-based platform for valuing transmission congestion. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion charges through the use of FTRs. FTRs are allocated to market participants by MISO for a twelve month period. There can be no assurance that we will be granted an adequate level of FTRs in the future to avoid material unhedged congestion charges. As allowed by the PSCW, unhedged congestion charges are deferred and we expect to recover these costs in future rates, subject to review and approval of the PSCW. ITEM 1B.
