ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS RISKS RELATED TO THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS THERE IS NO ASSURANCE OF ADDITIONAL RECOVERY FOR PAYMENT TO UNSECURED CREDITORS UNDER THE PMI & PMIGA PLAN. The PMI & PMIGA Plan involves some risk of reduced payment. The total recovery by unsecured creditors (Class 3 and 5) will depend upon: o the recovery of "preferences"; o recovery from the former executives, Theodore S. Li and Hui "Cynthia" Lee; and o the recovery in PMIGA's accounts receivable by the PMIGA Creditor Trust. As part of our bankruptcy proceedings, we have claims against vendors who received payments within 90 days of the bankruptcy petition date. These payments are called "preferences." No assurance can be made there will be a substantial recovery from any of these sources. In addition, as discussed above under Part I, Item 1. Business - Status of Bankruptcy Proceedings - Summary of Settlement with Former Executives, there was no recovery of funds from our former executives. 15 IF THE SETTLEMENT WITH OUR FORMER EXECUTIVES HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT If the Bankruptcy Court does not approve the proposed settlement with our former executives, and estimates their Subordinated Claims in an amount greater than $25,000, then the PMIC & LW Plan as proposed will be rendered ineffective. Moreover, if the settlement is not approved, the Subordinated Claims are allowed in any amount, such allowance will result in a corresponding diminution of the Pro Rata recovery of Creditors on account of Class 2 Unsecured Claims under the PMIC & LW Plan.] THE MATERIAL CONDITIONS FOR COMPLETION OF THE MERGER OF HERBORIUM WITH AND INTO PMIC MAY NOT BE MET, IN WHICH CASE THE STOCKHOLDERS OF PMIC AND THE HOLDERS OF CLASS 6 AND CLASS 7 EQUITY INTERESTS IN PMIC WILL HAVE NO RECOVERY. The PMIC & LW Plan contemplates that PMIC will enter into a reverse merger with Herborium, a provider of proprietary, natural and complimentary healthcare products, and shall be the surviving operating entity post-merger. Following are the material conditions for completion of the merger of Herborium with and into PMIC: o the completion of due diligence satisfactory to each party; o negotiation and execution of a definitive merger agreement and other documentation reasonably satisfactory to each party; o closing of a purchase agreement between Herborium and AH USA, a Massachusetts corporation, with respect to the acquisition by Herborium of all rights, intellectual property and other interests in the formulation of AcnEase; o absence of any adverse change in the business or financial condition of Herborium through the date of closing; o entry into employment and consulting agreements with the co-founders of Herborium, Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski who will serve as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Dr. James P. Gilligan who will serve as President and Chief Operating Officer; o all necessary approvals of the board and shareholders of each of the parties; o completion of audits of Herborium's financial statements as of and for the years ended November 30, 2005 and 2004 by a PCAOB certified independent accounting firm and the issuance of an unqualified opinion thereon; o the holder of PMIC's Series A Preferred Stock having converted its Series A Preferred Stock into 800,000 shares of common stock of PMIC prior to the merger; 16 o the confirmation of the PMIC & LW Plan by the Bankruptcy Court; and o prior to the merger, Herborium's obtaining and conditionally closing on a financing of $2,500,000 in secured convertible debt with Cornell Capital Partners, L.P. or another institutional investor as determined by Herborium. The PMIC & LW Plan contemplates that in connection with the merger: o the existing stock of PMIC will be cancelled, and new stock shall be issued; o with respect to the Class 6 equity interest of ACT, new stock will be issued directly to the shareholders of ACT subject to the dilution of such interests upon the consummation of the PMIC & LA Plan and the merger; and o new stock will be issued to the Class 7 equity interest of the holder of the Series A Preferred Stock in exchange for its 800,000 shares of common stock of PMIC, or 0.74% of Herborium post-merger. If the conditions to the merger are not satisfied, the stockholders of PMIC and ACT and the holder of PMIC's Series A Preferred Stock will have no recovery in connection with PMIC's bankruptcy. RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK OUR STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN AND IS LIKELY TO REMAIN VOLATILE. A public market for our common stock developed following our initial public offering, and our common stock has been quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board since May 1, 2003. Trading of our common stock has been sporadic, and the trading volume has generally been low. Even a small trading volume on a particular day or over a few days may affect the market price of our common stock. MARKET FLUCTUATIONS OR VOLATILITY COULD CAUSE THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE. The market price of our common stock could also be subject to fluctuations in response to variations in results of operations, announcements by competitors, general economic and market conditions and other factors. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE REMOVED FROM THE OVER-THE-COUNTER BULLETIN BOARD, WHICH WOULD LIKELY CAUSE THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE AND AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE. On April 5, 2006, we received notice from the OTC Bulletin Board that unless we cured our delinquency in filing the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 prior to the expiration of the grace period (May 5, 2006), our common stock would be removed from the 17 OTC Bulletin Board effective May 9, 2006. We have cured this delinquency with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, under applicable NASD Rules, if we are delinquent in our reporting obligations three times in a 24-month period and/or are actually removed from the OTC Bulletin Board for failure to file two times in a 24-month period, in each case, we would be ineligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board for a period of one year. To date, we have been delinquent one time in the past 24-month period. Should quotation of our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board or a similar facility cease for any reason, the liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise equity capital would likely decrease.
