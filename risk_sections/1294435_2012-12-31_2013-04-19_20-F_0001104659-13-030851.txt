D. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business We have a short operating history in a new and unproven market, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful. We entered the online video business in January 2010 when we acquired Ku6 Holding. As we subsequently disposed of the WVAS and recorded music businesses in August 2010 and a 80% interest in the online audio business in August 2011, we are currently operating the online video business as our principal business and generate substantially all of our revenues from online advertising. However, we only have a short operating history in this new and unproven market that may not develop as expected, if at all. This short operating history makes it difficult to effectively assess our future prospects. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter in this rapidly evolving market. We rely on Shengyue, an affiliated advertising agency, for substantially all of our revenues. If Shengyue fails to continue as our advertising agency or if we are unable to collect accounts receivable from Shengyue in a timely manner, our financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. We generate substantially all of our revenues from online advertising. Historically, we entered into a majority of our online advertising agreements with various third-party advertising agencies. In April 2011, we entered into an advertising agency agreement with Shengyue, an affiliate wholly owned by Shanda Interactive, pursuant to which Shengyue agreed to act as our exclusive advertising agency for our standard media resources and as our non-exclusive advertising agency for our highly interactive advertising resources. Since then, we have relied on Shengyue as our sole advertising agency, which manages our sales to, and collects payments from, substantially all of our advertisers. Pursuant to the advertising agency agreement with Shengyue, Shengyue generates advertising revenues for us by selling our advertising capacity and resources directly to advertising customers at a price it determines. Shengyue guarantees to us a minimum amount of revenues for each quarter. In return, we guarantee a certain amount of web traffic for our webpage on which Shengyue posts advertisements. If the advertising revenues from Shengyue exceed the minimum guaranteed amount, we are required to pay Shengyue a progressive commission fee based upon increasing percentages for additional tiers of revenue in excess of the guaranteed amount. We settle the advertising revenues net of commission fees with Shengyue on a periodic basis and recognize revenues net of commission fee. The initial term of this advertising agency agreement expired on December 31, 2012. In January 2013, we amended and restated this agreement with Shengyue and extended its term to December 31, 2013. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012, we generated advertising revenues of $8.1 million and $12.5 million from Shengyue. Since the commencement of the arrangement, we have been able to satisfy the web traffic requirements under the advertising agency agreement. As we enjoyed a commission-free trial period in 2011 under the agreement, and the advertising revenues in 2012 did not exceed the minimum amount guaranteed by Shengyue, we incurred nil and nil commission fees payable to Shengyue in 2011 and 2012, respectively. To the extent that future advertising sales by Shengyue to our advertisers increase significantly and exceed the minimum guaranteed amounts, progressively higher commission fees would be incurred, which may negatively affect our profit margin. 5 Table of Contents As Shengyue acts as our advertising agency for substantially all of our advertisers, we rely heavily on the operations of Shengyue to generate our revenues. If Shengyue fails to continue as our advertising agency or if we are unable to collect accounts receivable from Shengyue in a timely manner for any reason, our financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, there can be no assurance that this agreement will be extended or renewed after its expiration or that we will be able to further extend or renew such agreement on terms and conditions favorable to us. If Shengyue breaches its obligations under such agreement or refuses to extend or renew it on commercially reasonable terms when the term expires, we may not be able to find a suitable alternative advertising agency or establish our own sales team to make direct sales to the advertisers in a timely manner. Any termination or deterioration of our relationship with Shengyue, and any further extension or renewal on terms and conditions less favorable to us, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We require a significant amount of cash to fund our operations. We cannot assure you that we can meet our working capital requirements or other capital needs through improved operating results or additional financings in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The operation of an online user-generated content, or UGC, video business requires continuous, substantial investment in content, technology, talent and infrastructure. In order to implement our development strategies to expand our infrastructure and optimize our services across Internet-enabled devices, and further expand and diversify our revenue sources, we may incur additional capital needs in the future. We will also need to fund our research and development activities in order to remain competitive on cost and technology. We reported net losses attributable to our company of $51.5 million, $49.3 million and $9.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of $13.1 million and net current assets of $6.4 million. Our net cash used in operating activities in 2012 was $8.1 million. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise maintain sufficient working capital to finance our anticipated operations and capital expenditure requirements, as well as achieve projected cash collections from customers and contain expenses and cash used in operations. Achievement of better operating performance is not assured and management expects to continue to implement its liquidity plans, which includes reducing operating expenses. In addition, various matters may impact our liquidity such as: · inability to achieve planned operating results that could increase liquidity requirements beyond those considered in our business plan; · changes in financial market conditions or our business condition that could limit our access to existing credit facilities or make new financings more costly or even unfeasible; and · changes in Chinas currency exchange control regulations that could limit our ability to access cash in China to meet liquidity requirements for our operations in China or elsewhere. If we cannot meet our liquidity needs through improved operating results, we may need to obtain financings from financial institutions or issue debt securities. For example, on June 29, 2011, we issued $50,000,000 aggregate principal amount of senior convertible bonds to Shanda Media Group Limited (formerly known as Shanda Music Group Limited), or Shanda Media, a wholly owned subsidiary of Shanda Interactive. These senior convertible bonds were to mature in three years after issuance, but based on our working capital position, we redeemed the senior convertible bonds on September 30, 2011. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any future financings if required under commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, we may have to obtain additional funding through equity offerings. For example, pursuant to a share purchase agreement dated April 1, 2011, we issued 1,538,461,538 ordinary shares to Shanda Media for an aggregate purchase price of $50,000,000 (or $0.0325 per ordinary share). We may have to issue and sell additional securities to meet our liquidity needs, but our ability to sell our securities is not assured. Any additional issuance of securities would dilute the ownership of our shareholders and ADS holders. Our ability to obtain additional financings in the future is subject to a number of uncertainties, including: · our future business development, financial condition and results of operations; · general market conditions for financing activities by companies in our industry; and · macroeconomic, political and other conditions in China and elsewhere. If we cannot obtain sufficient funding to meet our working capital requirements or other capital expenditure needs, we may not be able to execute our growth strategies and our business, financial condition and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. 6 Table of Contents We have a history of losses, and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. We incurred net losses in each of the fiscal years from 2007 through 2009 and continued to incur losses in each of the fiscal years from 2010 through 2012 after we entered the online video business. Our ability to achieve profitability is affected by various factors, including: · growth of the online video industry and the online advertising market; · the transition from long-form professional content to short-form UGC; · the continued growth and maintenance of our user base; · our ability to control our costs and expenses; and · our ability to provide new advertising services to meet the demands of our advertising customers. Many of these factors are beyond our control. Our growth also depends on the continuous development of the online advertising market in China and brand advertisers allocation of more budgets to online video industry. We cannot assure you that online advertising, as a new marketing channel, will become more widely accepted in China or that the advertisers will increase their spending on online video websites. We may continue to incur net losses in the future due to our continued investments in content, technology, bandwidth and talent. If we cannot successfully offset our increased costs with an increase in net revenues, our gross margin, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may also continue to incur net losses in the future due to changes in the macroeconomic and regulatory environment, competitive dynamics and our inability to respond to these changes in a timely and effective manner. We operate in a highly competitive market and we may not be able to compete successfully against our competitors. We face significant competition, primarily from those companies that operate online video websites in China, which our management estimates to currently number over one hundred. A large number of independent online video sites, such as Youku.com and Tudou.com, compete against us. In addition, Chinese Internet portals, including Sina.com, Sohu.com and Baidu.com, and some of Chinas major TV networks, such as China Central Television, or CCTV, Phoenix Satellite TV and Hunan Satellite TV, which have longer operating histories and more experience in attracting and retaining users and managing customers than we do, have launched their own video businesses. We also face competition from Internet video streaming platforms based on the P2P technology, such as PPS and PPTV. We compete with these companies for users and advertisers. Our competitors may compete with us in a variety of ways, including by conducting brand promotions and other marketing activities and making acquisitions. In addition, certain online video websites may continue to derive their revenues from providing content that infringes third-party copyright and may not monitor their websites for any such infringing content. As a result, we may be placed at a disadvantage to some of these websites that do not incur similar costs as we do with respect to content monitoring. Some of our competitors have a longer operating history and significantly greater financial resources than we do, and in turn may be able to attract and retain more users and advertisers. If any of our competitors achieves greater market acceptance than we do or is able to offer more attractive online video content, our user traffic may decrease and our market share may decrease, which may result in a loss of advertisers and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Internet streaming of content represents only one of many existing and potential new technologies for viewing video. Many users maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple video providers and can easily shift from one provider to another. For example, users may subscribe to cable, buy a DVD, and download a movie from Apple iTunes or other sources, or some combination thereof. New competitors may be able to launch new businesses at a relatively low cost. We also face competition from other types of advertising media, such as newspapers, magazines, yellow pages, billboards and other forms of outdoor media, television and radio. Most large companies in China allocate, and will likely continue to allocate, most of their marketing budgets to traditional advertising media and only a small portion of their budgets to online marketing and other forms of advertising media. If these companies do not devote a larger portion of their marketing budgets to online marketing services provided by our online video business, or if our existing customers reduce the amount they spend on online marketing, our results of operations and future growth prospects could be adversely affected. 7 Table of Contents The online video industry in China and user acceptance of our online video content may not grow as quickly as expected, which may adversely affect our revenues and business prospects. Our business prospects depend on the continuing development of the online video industry in China. As an emerging industry, Chinas online video industry has experienced substantial growth in recent years in terms of both users and content. We cannot assure you, however, that the online video industry will continue to grow as rapidly as it has in the past. With the development of technology, new forms of media may emerge and render online video websites less attractive to users. Growth of the online video industry is affected by numerous factors, such as users general online video experience, technological innovations, development of Internet and Internet-based services, regulatory changes, especially regulations affecting copyrights, and the macroeconomic environment. If the online video industry in China does not grow as quickly as expected or if we fail to benefit from such growth by successfully implementing our business strategies, our user traffic may decrease and our business and prospects may be adversely affected. We operate in a rapidly evolving industry. If we fail to keep up with the technological developments and users changing requirements, our business, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. The online video industry is rapidly evolving and subject to continuous technological changes and changes in industry standards. Our success will depend on our ability to keep up with the changes in technology and user behavior resulting from the technological developments. For example, the development of broadband enabled the enjoyment of high definition videos online. In addition, the number of people accessing the Internet via devices other than personal computers, including mobile phones and other hand-held devices, has increased in recent years. With the rapid development of 3G and 4G mobile communication services in China, we expect this trend to continue. If we do not adapt our products and services to such changes in an effective and timely manner, we may suffer from a decreased user traffic, which may result in a reduced number of advertisers using our online advertising services. Furthermore, changes in technologies may require substantial capital expenditures in product development as well as in modification of products, services or infrastructure. Failure in keeping up with technological development may result in our products and services being less attractive, which in turn, may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. If we fail to continue to anticipate user preferences and provide products and services to attract and retain users, we may not be able to generate sufficient user traffic to remain competitive. Our success depends on our ability to generate sufficient user traffic through provision of attractive products and services. To attract and retain users and compete against our competitors, we must maintain high-quality UGC that provides our users with a satisfactory online video experience. With UGC, users can upload and share their own videos and spend a longer time on our website, and we believe a community-like environment will enhance users loyalty to our website and such network effect broadens advertisers reach of audience. Based on the feedback on our website design and our statistics regarding users watching behavior, we keep developing new website features that appeal to users, such as designing more user-friendly content searching tools, creating additional interactive social functions or offering better website compatibility with new Internet-enabled devices. We need to continuously anticipate user preferences and industry changes and respond to such changes in a timely and effective manner. If we fail to cater to the needs and preferences of our users and, as a result, fail to deliver satisfactory user experience, we may suffer from reduced user traffic and our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The success of our business depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand. We believe that maintaining and enhancing our Ku6 brand is of significant importance to the success of our business. Since the online video market is highly competitive, a well-recognized brand is critical to increasing our user base and, in turn, enhancing our attractiveness to advertisers. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as the number of Internet users in China grows. In order to attract and retain Internet users and advertisers, we may need to substantially increase our expenditures for creating and maintaining brand loyalty. Our success in promoting and enhancing our brand, as well as our ability to remain competitive, will also depend on our success in offering high-quality content, features and functionality. If we fail to promote our brand successfully or if visitors to our website or advertisers do not perceive our content and services to be of high quality, we may not be able to continue growing our business and attracting users and advertisers. 8 Table of Contents You may not be able to rely on our quarterly operating results as an indication of our future performance because our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations. We may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could be caused by many factors, including, but not limited to: · our ability to retain existing users, attract new users at a steady rate and maintain user satisfaction; · the creation of new content by our users and the popularity of such content; · technical difficulties, system downtime or Internet failures for our websites; · the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure ; · the adoption of new, or changes to existing, governmental regulations; and · economic conditions in general and specific to the online video industry in China. As a result, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter or semi-annual-to-semi-annual comparisons of our operating results as indicators of our future performance. Our operating results may be below our expectations or the expectations of public market analysts and investors in one or more future quarters. If that occurs, the price of our ADSs could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. We may be subject to administrative actions by PRC regulatory authorities and other liabilities because of advertisements shown on our website. Under PRC advertising laws and regulations, we are obligated to monitor the advertising content shown on our website to ensure that such content is true, accurate and in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, where a special government review is required for specific types of advertisements prior to website posting, such as advertisements relating to pharmaceuticals, medical instruments, agrochemicals and veterinary pharmaceuticals, we are obligated to confirm that such review has been performed and approval has been obtained from competent governmental authority, which is generally the local branch of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, or the SAIC. Violation of these laws and regulations may subject us to penalties, including fines, confiscation of our advertising income, orders to cease dissemination of the advertisements and orders to publish an announcement correcting the misleading information. In circumstances involving serious violations, such as posting a pharmaceutical product advertisement without approval, or posting an advertisement for fake pharmaceutical products, PRC governmental authorities may force us to terminate our advertising operation or revoke our licenses. Furthermore, advertisers, advertising operators or advertising distributors, including us, may be subject to civil liability if they infringe on the legal rights and interests of third parties. Substantially all of the advertisements shown on our website are provided to us by our advertising agency on behalf of advertisers. We cannot assure you that all the content contained in such advertisements is true and accurate as required by the advertising laws and regulations, especially given the uncertainty in the application of these laws and regulations. For example, Article 38 of the Advertisement Law provides that an advertisement operator who knows or should have known the posted advertisement is false or fraudulent will be subject to joint and several liabilities. However, for the determination of the truth and accuracy of the advertisements and the actual or constructive knowledge of the website, there are no implementing rules or official interpretations, and such a determination is at the sole discretion of the relevant local branch of the SAIC, which results in uncertainty in the application of these laws and regulations. If we are found to be in violation of applicable PRC advertising laws and regulations in the future, we may be subject to penalties and our reputation may be harmed, which may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. See Item 4.B. Business OverviewGovernment RegulationRegulations on Advertisements. 9 Table of Contents We may need to record impairment charges to earnings if our acquisition goodwill or acquired intangible assets are determined to be impaired, which would adversely affect our results of operations. As part of our expansion and diversification strategy, we may acquire or invest in companies in the same or related industries in which we operate. We record acquisition goodwill and acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet in connection with such acquisitions and investments arrangements, respectively. We are required to review our acquisition goodwill for impairment at least annually and review our acquired intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, including a decline in stock price and market capitalization and a slowdown in our industry, which may result from the recent global economic slowdown. If the carrying value of our acquisition goodwill or acquired intangible assets were determined to be impaired, we would be required to write down the carrying value or to record charges to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which our acquisition goodwill or acquired intangible assets is determined to be impaired. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, we recorded impairment of nil, nil and nil, respectively, for acquisition goodwill relating to our discontinued and continued operations and impairment of nil, $1.4 million and nil, respectively, for acquired intangible assets relating to our discontinued and continued operations. Any significant impairment charges would adversely affect our results of operations. Disruption or failure of our systems could impair our users online video experience and adversely affect our reputation. Our ability to provide users with a high-quality online video experience depends on the continuous and reliable operation of our systems. We cannot assure you that we will be able to procure sufficient bandwidth in a timely manner or on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to do so may significantly impair user experience on our website and decrease the overall effectiveness of our website to both users and advertisers. Disruptions, failures, unscheduled service interruptions or a decrease in connection speeds could hurt user experience and our reputation, causing our users and advertisers to switch to our competitors websites. Our systems and proprietary video content delivery network, or CDN, are vulnerable to damage or interruption as a result of fires, floods, earthquakes, power losses, telecommunications failures, undetected errors in software, computer viruses, hacking and other attempts to harm our systems. We have experienced service interruptions in the past which typically were caused by (i) overload of our servers, (ii) unexpected overflow of user traffic, and (iii) service malfunction of the telecommunications operators, such as power outage of Internet data centers or network transmission congestion. We may continue to experience similar interruptions in the future despite our continuous efforts to improve our systems. Since we host our servers at third-party Internet data centers, any natural disaster or unexpected closure of Internet data centers operated by third-party providers may result in lengthy service interruptions. If we experience frequent or persistent service disruptions, whether caused by failures of our own systems or those of third-party service providers, our users experience may be negatively affected, which in turn, may have a material and adverse effect on our reputation. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in minimizing the frequency or duration of service interruptions. Undetected programming errors could adversely affect user experience and the market acceptance of our video programs, which may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. The video programs, including advertising video programs, on our website may contain programming errors that may only become apparent after their release. We receive user feedback in connection with programming errors affecting their user experience from time to time, and such errors may also come to our attention during our monitoring process. We generally have been able to resolve such programming errors in a timely manner. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to detect and resolve all these programming errors effectively. Undetected audio or video programming errors or defects may adversely affect user experience and cause our advertisers to reduce their use of our services, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our operations depend on the performance of the Internet infrastructure and telecommunications networks in China and third-party service providers. Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet. Therefore, the successful operation of our business depends on the performance of the Internet infrastructure and telecommunications networks in China. Almost all access to the Internet is maintained through state-owned telecommunications operators under the administrative control and regulatory supervision of Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT. Moreover, we have entered into contracts with various subsidiaries of a limited number of telecommunications service providers in each province and rely on them to provide us with data communications capacity through local telecommunications lines and Internet data centers to host our servers. We have limited access to alternative networks or services in the event of disruptions, failures or other problems with Chinas Internet infrastructure or the telecommunications networks provided by telecommunications service providers. Our Ku6.com website regularly serves a large number of users and advertisers. With the expansion of our business, we may be required to upgrade our technology and infrastructure to keep up with the increasing traffic on our websites. However, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by telecommunications service providers. If the prices we pay for telecommunications and Internet services rise significantly, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. If Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, our user traffic may decline and our business may be hurt. Our servers, which are partly hosted at third-party Internet data centers, are vulnerable to break-ins, sabotage and vandalism. The occurrence of a natural disaster or a closure of an Internet data center by a third-party provider without adequate notice could result in lengthy service interruptions. Moreover, the agreements we have entered into with domestic telecommunications carriers to host our servers typically have terms of approximately one year and are renewable subject to early termination. If we are not able to renew such hosting services agreements with the telecommunications carriers when they expire and are not able to enter into agreements with alternative carriers at commercially reasonable terms or at all, the quality and stability of our services may be adversely affected. In addition, our domain names are resolved into Internet protocol (IP) addresses by systems of third-party domain name registrars and registries. Any interruptions or failures of those service providers systems, which are beyond our control, could significantly disrupt our own services. 10 Table of Contents If we experience frequent or persistent system failures on our websites, whether due to interruptions and failures of our own information technology and communications systems or those of third-party service providers we rely upon, our reputation and brand could be permanently harmed. The steps we take to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems are expensive, may reduce our operating margin and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of service interruptions. We also depend significantly on relationships with leading technology providers and the licenses that the technology providers have granted to us. Our competitors may establish the same relationships as we have, which may adversely affect us. We may not be able to maintain these relationships or replace them on commercially attractive terms. We have been and expect to continue to be exposed to intellectual property infringement and other claims, including claims based on content posted on our website. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to operate our business without infringing third-party rights, including third-party intellectual property rights. Internet companies, technology and media industries own, and are seeking to obtain, a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, and they are frequently involved in litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights or other related legal rights. There may be patents issued or pending that are held by others that cover significant aspects of our technologies, products, business methods or services. We have been and may continue to be subject to claims for defamation, negligence, infringement of third-party copyright and other rights, such as privacy and image rights, or other claims based on the nature or content of videos or other information provided by Ku6 Holding or our users on our websites. Prior to the acquisition by us, Ku6 Holding recorded expenses relating to such claims of $1.6 million and $0.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. After the acquisition in 2010, we recorded expenses relating to such claims of nil and $2.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively, and recorded a benefit of $0.1 million (being the net effect of reversal of previously recorded expenses of $1.0 million and current period expense of $0.9 million) during the year ended December 31, 2012. We paid $1.0 million, $0.2 million and $0.5 million to settle such claims during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, and the balance of accrued litigation provision was $0.7 million, $2.7 million and $2.1 million as of December 31 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. We do not carry any liability insurance covering such risks. Due to the significant number of videos uploaded by users, which currently amounts to an average of approximately 105,000 files on a daily basis, we may not be able to identify all content that may infringe on third-party rights. Thus, our failure to identify unauthorized videos posted on our website may subject us to, and may continue to subject us to, claims of infringement on third-party intellectual property rights or other rights. Third parties may also make claims against us for losses incurred in reliance on the information on our websites. In addition, we may be subject to administrative actions brought by the National Copyright Administration of the PRC, or the NCAC, or its local branches for alleged copyright infringement. Although we have not previously been subject to legal actions for copyright infringement in jurisdictions other than the PRC, it is possible that we may be subject to such claims in the future. Such other jurisdictions may impose different protections for copyrights, and the claims may result in potentially larger damages awards than have been imposed in the PRC. For example, although our operations are in China and our site is targeted at audiences in Asia, our site includes some English-language content and is accessible by users in the United States and elsewhere. There is a risk that a U.S. court may determine that it has jurisdiction over us in connection with claims for U.S. copyrights. Although U.S. copyright laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512), or the DMCA, provide safeguards from claims for monetary relief for copyright infringement for certain entities that host user-uploaded content and that comply with specified statutory requirements, it is possible that a U.S. court would conclude that it has jurisdiction and that we are not eligible for, or have not complied with all the statutory requirements to qualify for, the safeguards provided by the DMCA. Under such circumstances, it is possible that we could be subject to claims of copyright infringement in the United States. 11 Table of Contents It could be time-consuming and costly to defend these claims, which, with or without merit, may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities and could materially and adversely affect our business, and also result in diversion of the attention of our management and our financial resources and negative publicity on our brand and reputation. The failure to successfully defend any of them may result in substantial damage awards and/or court orders that may prevent us from continuing to provide certain of our existing services. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position. We believe that trademarks, trade secrets, patents, copyrights and other intellectual property we use are important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws in China and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and our brand. We have invested significant resources to develop our own intellectual property and acquire licenses to use and distribute the intellectual property of others for our online video site; failure to maintain or protect these rights could harm our business. In addition, any unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties may adversely affect our current and future revenues and our reputation. The validity, enforceability and scope of protection available under intellectual property laws with respect to the Internet industry in China are uncertain and still evolving. Implementation and enforcement of PRC intellectual property-related laws have historically been deficient and ineffective. Accordingly, protection of intellectual property rights in China may not be as effective as in the United States or other western countries. Furthermore, policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive, and we may need to resort to litigation to enforce or defend copyrights issued to us or our other intellectual property or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of others. Such litigation and an adverse determination in any such litigation, if any, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Complexity, uncertainties and changes in government policies or regulations of Internet industry may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our online video business is subject to strict government regulations in China. The PRC government extensively regulates the Internet industry, including foreign ownership of, and the licensing and permit requirements pertaining to, companies in the Internet industry. Under the current PRC regulatory scheme, a number of regulatory agencies, including the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television, or SARFT, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or MIIT, the General Administration of Press and Publication, or GAPP, the State Council Information Office, or SCIO, and the State Internet Information Office established by SCIO in May 2011, jointly regulate all major aspects of the Internet industry, including the online video industry. Operators must comply with restrictions related to foreign investment in value-added telecommunication services industry in China and obtain various government approvals and licenses, including an Internet content provider license, or ICP license, and an Internet audio/video program transmission license, prior to the commencement of online video operations. 12 Table of Contents We believe that we have obtained the licenses and permits essential for our business operations. However, given the Internet-related laws and regulations are relatively new and rapidly evolving in China, their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainty. As a result, in certain circumstances it may be difficult to determine what actions or omissions may be deemed to violate applicable laws and regulations. The permits, licenses or approvals that we hold may be subject to challenge, we may fail to obtain permits or licenses that may be deemed necessary for our operations, or we may not be able to renew certain permits or licenses. We may also need to apply for additional permits or licenses when we enter new sectors of the Internet industry. For example, we may need to apply for the Internet News Information Service Permit issued by the SCIO or the Internet Publication License issued by the GAPP in connection with the current events channel on our website. We are also in the process of applying to upgrade the Internet audio/video program transmission license to cover all contents that are being transmitted through our website and the related activities. If we fail to maintain any of the required permits, licenses or approvals, we may be subject to various penalties, including fines and discontinuation of, or restriction on, our operations. Any such disruption of our business operations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, actions by the PRC government, including the interpretation, re-interpretation and application of existing PRC laws, regulations and policies and promulgation of new laws, regulations or policies relating to the Internet industry, may create substantial uncertainties regarding the legality of existing and future foreign investments in the Internet industry in China. Any such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. For example, in December 2012, the GAPP published a proposed rule relating to Internet publication which, among other things, seeks to clarify the meaning of the Internet publication service and Internet publication as well as modify the application procedures for the relevant license. We plan to apply for the required license once the final rule is issued. However, we cannot assure you that such application would be approved by the relevant governmental agencies in a timely manner or at all. If we fail to obtain the license, we may be subject to various administrative penalties, including fines and confiscation of our income or assets, and we may be forced to discontinue our business and our website may be blocked. We have limited business insurance coverage. Insurance companies in China currently do not offer as extensive an array of insurance products as insurance companies do in more developed economies. We do not have any business liability or disruption insurance to cover our operations. We have determined that the costs of insuring for these risks and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. Any uninsured occurrence of business disruption may result in our incurring substantial costs and the diversion of resources, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Regulation and censorship of information disseminated over the Internet in China may adversely affect our business and subject us to liability for information displayed on or linked to our websites. The PRC government has adopted regulations governing Internet access and the distribution of news and other information over the Internet. Under these regulations, Internet content providers and Internet publishers are prohibited from posting or displaying over the Internet content that, among other things, violates PRC laws and regulations, impairs the national dignity of China, or is reactionary, obscene, superstitious, fraudulent or defamatory. Furthermore, Internet content providers are also prohibited from displaying content that may be deemed by relevant government authorities as socially destabilizing or leaking state secrets of the PRC. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in administrative penalties, such as fines, the revocation of licenses to provide Internet content and other licenses and the closure of the concerned websites. In the past, failure to comply with such requirements has resulted in the closure of certain websites. The website operator may also be held liable for such censored information displayed on or linked to the website. In addition, the MIIT has published regulations that subject website operators to potential liability for content displayed on their websites and the actions of users and others using their systems, including liability for violations of PRC laws and regulations prohibiting the dissemination of content deemed to be socially destabilizing. The Ministry of Public Security has the authority to order any local Internet service provider to block any Internet website at its sole discretion. From time to time, the Ministry of Public Security has stopped the dissemination over the Internet of information that it believes to be socially destabilizing. The State Secrecy Bureau is also authorized to block any website it deems to be leaking state secrets or failing to meet the relevant regulations relating to the protection of state secrets in the dissemination of online information. Furthermore, we are required to report any suspicious content to relevant governmental authorities, and to undergo computer security inspections. If we fail to implement the relevant safeguards against security breaches, our websites may be shut down and our business and ICP licenses may be revoked. 13 Table of Contents Although we attempt to monitor the content on our websites, we are not able to control or restrict the content of other Internet content providers linked to or accessible through our websites, or content uploaded to, or generated or placed on, our websites by our users. To the extent that PRC regulatory authorities find any content displayed on our websites objectionable, they may require us to limit or eliminate the dissemination of such information on our websites. If third-party websites linked to or accessible through our website operate unlawful activities such as online gambling on their websites, PRC regulatory authorities may require us to report such unlawful activities to relevant authorities and to remove the links to such websites, or they may suspend or shut down the operation of such websites. PRC regulatory authorities may also temporarily block access to certain websites for a period of time for reasons beyond our control. Any of these actions may reduce our user traffic and adversely affect our business. In addition, we may be subject to penalties for violations of those regulations arising from information displayed on or linked to our websites, including a suspension or shutdown of our online operations. Concerns about collection, use and security of personal data could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our services. We have an extensive user base for our video platform, from which we collect personal data about our registered users. Under our privacy policy, without our users prior consent, we may not provide any of our users personal data to any unrelated third party. While we strive to comply with our privacy policies and other applicable data protection laws and regulations, any failure or perceived failure of compliance may result in proceedings or actions against us by our users, government authorities or other parties, and could damage our reputation. User and regulatory attitudes toward privacy are evolving, and their concerns about the extent to which personal data may be recorded, used or shared may adversely affect our ability to record, use or share such data, which may limit our advertising capabilities and the effectiveness of the marketing efforts of our advertising agencies. Concerns about the security of personal data could also lead to a decline in general Internet usage, which could lead to lower user traffic on our platform. Recently, the PRC government started to require, to certain extent, real name registration for Internet services. Decrease of anonymity may impair user experience of online media consumption, deter our users from viewing, uploading and sharing videos on our website and reduce the amount of their interactive activities. A significant reduction in user traffic could lead to lower advertising revenues. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. We are subject to reporting obligations under the U.S. securities laws. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, adopted rules requiring every public company to include a management report on the effectiveness of such companys internal control over financial reporting in its annual report. In addition, an independent registered public accounting firm must report on such companys internal control over financial reporting. Our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012 and our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report concluding that our internal control over financial reporting was effective in all material aspects. However, we had identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 relating to a lack of sufficient competent accounting personnel with appropriate levels of accounting knowledge and experience to address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and prepare financial statements and related disclosures under U.S. GAAP. Although such material weakness was subsequently rectified and our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011 and 2012, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on a continuing basis in the future. As effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud, any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could negatively impact the trading price of our ADSs. Furthermore, we may need to incur additional costs and use additional management and other resources in an effort to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other requirements going forward. 14 Table of Contents We believe that we were a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for taxable years 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 and it was not clear whether we were a PFIC for taxable year 2011. Although we believe we were not a PFIC for taxable year 2012, we may be a PFIC for subsequent taxable years, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors. We will be a PFIC for U.S. tax purposes for a taxable year if either (a) 75% or more of our gross income for such taxable year is passive income or (b) 50% or more of the average quarterly value, generally determined by fair market value, of our assets during such taxable year consists of assets that either produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income. For such purposes, if we directly or indirectly own 25% or more of the shares of another corporation, we generally will be treated as if we (a) held directly a proportionate share of the other corporations assets and (b) received directly a proportionate share of the other corporations income. We believe that we were a PFIC for taxable years 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, and it was not clear whether we were a PFIC for taxable year 2011. The determination of our PFIC status is subject to uncertainty, however, because the treatment of the contractual arrangements between our PRC subsidiaries and our VIEs for purposes of the PFIC rules is uncertain. If we were a PFIC for 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2011, and you held ordinary shares or ADSs during any such taxable years, we would continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to those ordinary shares or ADSs for all succeeding years during which you hold them. Our PFIC status for any taxable year will not be determinable until after the end of the taxable year and will depend on the composition of our income and assets and the market value of our assets for such taxable year, which may be, in part, based on the market price of our ordinary shares or ADSs (which may be especially volatile). For these reasons, and because of the uncertainties regarding the treatment of our contractual arrangements with our VIEs, there can be no assurance we will not be a PFIC for any taxable year. Such characterization could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. investor. In general, if we are a PFIC, then excess distributions to a U.S. investor and any gain realized by a U.S. investor on the sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares or ADSs will be allocated ratably over the U.S investors holding period for the ordinary shares or ADSs; the amount allocated to the taxable year of receipt of the proceeds of such distribution or disposition and any year prior to our becoming a PFIC will be taxed as ordinary income; and the amount allocated to each other taxable year will be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for the applicable class of taxpayer for that year. Additionally, an interest charge will be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such other taxable year and the U.S. investor will be subject to U.S. tax reporting requirements. Alternatively, if we are a PFIC and if our ADSs are regularly traded on a qualified exchange, a U.S. investor could make a mark-to-market election that would result in tax treatment different from the general tax treatment for PFICs described above. Given the complexity of the issues regarding our classification as a PFIC, U.S. investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors for guidance as to the U.S. federal, state and local and other tax consequences of our status as a PFIC in light of their particular circumstances, as well as the availability of, and procedures for making, a mark-to-market or other available election. For further discussion of the adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences of our classification as a PFIC, see Item 10.E. TaxationU.S. Federal Income Taxation below. Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure If the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our businesses in China do not comply with PRC governmental restrictions on foreign investment in Internet business, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations. Current PRC laws and regulations place certain restrictions on foreign ownership of companies that engage in Internet business, including the provision of online video and online advertising services. Specifically, foreign ownership in an Internet content provider or other value-added telecommunication service providers may not exceed 50%. Moreover, a foreign investor must have certain track record in the value-added telecommunication business or advertisement business before it can obtain direct equity interests in a PRC company that operates in these industries. Since we are a Cayman Islands company without any track-record of value-added telecommunication service or advertisement operations, neither we nor our PRC subsidiaries are eligible to hold a license to operate our website or our advertisement business in China. As a result, we conduct our operations in China principally through contractual arrangements among our PRC subsidiaries, our consolidated affiliated entities, and their respective shareholders. These contractual arrangements enable us to exercise effective control over these entities and hence treat them as our consolidated affiliated entities and consolidate their results. For a detailed discussion of these contractual arrangements, see Item 4.C. Organizational Structure. 15 Table of Contents PRC laws and regulations governing the validity of these contractual arrangements are uncertain and the relevant government authorities have broad discretion in interpreting these laws and regulations. Although we believe we are in compliance with current PRC regulations, we cannot assure you that the PRC government would hold the same view with us or these contractual arrangements comply with regulations or policies that may be amended or adopted in the future. On July 13, 2006, the MIIT issued the Notice of the MIIT on Intensifying the Administration of Foreign Investment in Value-added Telecommunications Services. This notice prohibits domestic telecommunication services providers from leasing, transferring or selling telecommunications business operating licenses to any foreign investor in any form, or providing any resources, sites or facilities to any foreign investor for their illegal operation of a telecommunications business in China. According to this notice, either the holder of a value-added telecommunication business operating license or its shareholders must legally own the domain names and trademarks used by such license holders in their provision of value-added telecommunication services. The notice further requires each license holder to have the necessary facilities, including servers, for its approved business operations and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license. In addition, all value-added telecommunication service providers are required to maintain network and Internet security in accordance with the standards set forth in relevant PRC regulations. If a license holder fails to comply with the requirements in the notice and cure such noncompliance, the MIIT or its local counterparts have the discretion to take measures against such license holders, including revoking their valued-added telecommunication business operating licenses. Ku6 Information Technology, one of our consolidated affiliated entities, holds the licenses and permits necessary to conduct our online video, online advertising and related businesses in China. However, the related trademarks are owned by Beijing WFOE, one of our wholly owned PRC subsidiaries. If the MIIT strictly enforces the notice, we may be required to transfer those trademarks from Beijing WFOE to Ku6 Information Technology. If the PRC government determines that we do not comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could revoke our business and operating licenses, including our value-added telecommunication license and ICP license, require us to discontinue or restrict our operations, restrict our right to collect revenues, block our website, require us to restructure our operations, impose additional conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply, or take other regulatory or enforcement actions against us that could be harmful to our business. The imposition of any of these penalties would result in a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. Our existing contractual arrangements with our consolidated affiliated entities and their shareholders may be subject to national security review by MOFCOM, and the failure to pass the national security review could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and reputation. In August 2011, the Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, promulgated the Rules of Ministry of Commerce on Implementation of Security Review System of Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the MOFCOM Security Review Rules, to implement the Notice of the General Office of the State Council on Establishing the Security Review System for Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors promulgated on February 3, 2011, or Circular 6. The MOFCOM Security Review Rules became effective on September 1, 2011. Under the MOFCOM Security Review Rules, a national security review is required for certain mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors raising concerns regarding national defense and security. Foreign investors are prohibited from circumventing the national security review requirements by structuring transactions through proxies, trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual arrangements or offshore transactions. The application and interpretation of the MOFCOM Security Review Rules remain unclear. If MOFCOM or other PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that we need to submit our existing contractual arrangements with our affiliated PRC entity and its shareholders for national security review by interpretation, clarification or amendment of the MOFCOM Security Review Rules or by any new rules, regulations or directives promulgated after the date of this report, we may face sanctions by MOFCOM or other PRC regulatory agency. These sanctions may include revoking the business or operating licenses of our PRC subsidiaries or our consolidated affiliated entities and its subsidiaries, discontinuing or restricting our operations in China, confiscating our income or the income of our PRC subsidiaries or our consolidated affiliated entities, requiring us to undergo a costly and disruptive restructuring such as forcing us to transfer our equity interest in our PRC subsidiaries to a domestic entity or invalidating the agreements that our PRC subsidiaries have entered into with our consolidated affiliated entities and their respective shareholders, and taking other regulatory or enforcement actions that could be harmful to our business. Any of these sanctions could cause significant disruption to our business operations, including rendering us unable to access cash and other assets of, exercise our ownership rights in and consolidate the results of operations of our affiliated entities in China, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and reputation. 16 Table of Contents We rely on contractual arrangements with our consolidated affiliated entities in China and their shareholders for our operations, which may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control. Since PRC laws restrict foreign equity ownership in companies engaged in online video and advertising businesses in China, we rely on contractual arrangements with our consolidated affiliated entities and their respective shareholders to operate our business in China. If we had direct ownership of Ku6 Information Technology, Tianjin Ku6 Zheng Yuan, Ku6 Cultural and Tianjin Ku6 Network, we would be able to: (i) exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect changes in the board of directors of these entities, which in turn could effect changes at the management level, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations, and (ii) derive economic benefits from the operations of these entities by causing them to declare and pay dividends. However, under the current contractual arrangements, we rely on our consolidated affiliated entities and their respective shareholders performance of their contractual obligations to exercise effective control. In general, neither our consolidated affiliated entities nor their respective shareholders may terminate the contracts prior to the expiration date. However, the shareholders of Ku6 Information Technology, Tianjin Ku6 Zheng Yuan, Ku6 Cultural or Tianjin Ku6 Network may not act in the best interests of our company or may not perform their obligations under these contracts, including the obligation to renew these contracts when their initial terms expire. Such risks exist throughout the period in which we intend to operate our business through the contractual arrangements with our consolidated affiliated entities. However, if any dispute relating to these contracts remains unresolved, we will have to enforce our rights under these contracts through the operations of PRC law and courts and therefore will be subject to uncertainties in the PRC legal system. See Any failure by our consolidated affiliated entities or their respective shareholders to perform their obligations under our contractual arrangements with them may have a material adverse effect on our business below. Therefore, these contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over these consolidated affiliated entities. Any failure by our consolidated affiliated entities or their respective shareholders to perform their obligations under our contractual arrangements with them may have a material adverse effect on our business. Our consolidated affiliated entities and their respective shareholders may fail to take certain actions required for our business or follow our instructions despite their contractual obligations to do so. If they fail to perform their obligations under their respective agreements with us, we may have to rely on legal remedies under PRC law, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, which may not be effective. All of our contractual arrangements with them are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in China. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal environment in China is not as developed as in certain other jurisdictions, such as the United States. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements, which may make it difficult to exert effective control over our consolidated affiliated entities, and our ability to conduct our business may be adversely affected. Contractual arrangements with our consolidated affiliated entities may result in adverse tax consequences to us. Under applicable PRC tax laws and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities within ten years after the taxable year when the arrangements or transactions are conducted. We could face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities were to determine that the contractual arrangements among our PRC subsidiaries, our consolidated affiliated entities in China and their respective shareholders were not entered into on an arms-length basis and therefore constituted unfavorable transfer pricing arrangements. Unfavorable transfer pricing arrangements could, among other things, result in an upward adjustment to our tax liability. In addition, the PRC tax authorities may impose interest on late payments on our consolidated affiliated entities for the adjusted but unpaid taxes. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if our consolidated affiliated entities tax liabilities increase significantly or if they are required to pay interest on late payments. 17 Table of Contents The shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities may have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business. We conduct substantially all of our operations, and generate substantially all of our revenues, through our consolidated affiliated entities. Our control over these entities is based upon contractual arrangements with our consolidated affiliated entities and their shareholders that provide us with the substantial ability to control these entities. We provide no incentives to any of the shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities for the purpose of encouraging them to act in the best interest of our company in such capacity. These shareholders may breach their contractual arrangements, or cause our consolidated affiliated entities to breach their contractual arrangements, with us or cause these contracts to be amended in a manner contrary to the interest of our company, if they believe such action furthers their own interest, or if they otherwise act in bad faith. We cannot assure you that, when conflicts arise, these shareholders will act in the best interest of our company or that conflicts will be resolved in our favor. If we cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or disputes between us and any of these shareholders, we would have to rely on legal proceedings, which may be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. There is also substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings. We rely on our PRC subsidiaries and our consolidated affiliated entities to fund our cash and financing requirements. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries and our consolidated affiliated entities to transfer funds to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow or otherwise fund our cash and financing requirements. We are a holding company and our operations are principally conducted through our PRC subsidiaries and our consolidated affiliated entities. As a result, the ability of our company to pay dividends and to finance debts depends upon the service fees and license fees paid by our consolidated affiliated entities to our PRC subsidiaries and dividends and other distributions paid by our PRC subsidiaries to our company. If any of our subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities incurs debt on its own behalf, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay service fees or dividends directly or indirectly to our company. Under PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries and our consolidated affiliated entities may pay dividends only out of their retained earnings as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. There is no significant difference between retained earnings as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our PRC subsidiaries and our consolidated affiliated entities are required to set aside at least 10% of their after-tax net income each year, if any, to fund certain statutory reserves, which are not distributable as cash dividends, until the aggregate amount of such funds reaches 50% of their respective registered capital. As of December 31, 2012, the registered capital was $11,700,000 for Beijing WFOE, $60,000,000 for Tianjin WFOE and $30,000,000 for Tianjin Ku6 Network WFOE, respectively. As none of our PRC subsidiaries has made any profits to date, our PRC subsidiaries have not been subject to the statutory reserve fund requirements and have not set aside any money to fund the statutory reserve funds or staff welfare and bonus funds. Our PRC subsidiaries will not be able to pay dividends to us or our offshore subsidiaries until they generate accumulated profits and meet the requirements for statutory reserve funds. As a result of these and other restrictions under PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to our company either in the form of dividends, loans or advances, which restricted portion amounted to approximately $52.7 million, or 157.0% of our companys total consolidated net assets, as of December 31, 2012. In addition, our PRC subsidiaries and our consolidated affiliated entities may, at their discretion, allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. These staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business. We may be unable to collect long-term loans extended to the shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities. As of December 31, 2012, we made long-term, interest-free loans in an aggregate principal amount of RMB31.0 million ($5.0 million) to the shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities to enable them to fund the initial capitalization and the subsequent financial requirements of our consolidated affiliated entities. Each of the loans to the shareholders of Ku6 Information Technology and Ku6 Cultural has an unspecified term and will be repayable upon demand. Each of the loans to the shareholders of Tianjin Ku6 Network has an initial term of 20 years expiring in December 2031, which can be extended upon written agreement. We may in the future make additional loans to the shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities in China in connection with any increase in the capitalization or financial requirements of these entities to the extent necessary and permissible under applicable PRC laws and regulations. Our ability to collect these long-term loans will depend on the profitability and results of operations of these consolidated affiliated entities, which are uncertain. 18 Table of Contents The new PRC Property Rights Law may affect the perfection of the pledge in our equity pledge agreements with our consolidated affiliated entities and their individual shareholders. Under the equity pledge agreements among our PRC subsidiaries, certain of our consolidated affiliated entities and the shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities, the shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities have pledged all of their equity interests in these entities to our relevant subsidiaries by recording the pledge on the shareholder registers of the respective entities. According to the PRC Property Rights Law, which became effective as of October 1, 2007, a pledge is not valid unless it is registered with the relevant local administration for industry and commerce. The SAIC and its local branches have adopted registration procedures with respect to the registration of equity pledges according to the Property Rights Law. All of our consolidated affiliated entities have completed their registration of the applicable equity pledges under the PRC Property Rights Law and the registration procedures. However, our corporate structure may change from time to time, and the various equity pledge agreements may need to be frequently amended. For example, the shareholders of Ku6 Culture and Ku6 Information Technology changed in August 2012, which required us to amend the registered equity pledges. We completed both amendments in 2012. We cannot assure you, however, that our consolidated affiliated entities will be able to register the equity pledges or their amendments in the future. If they are unable to do so, the pledges may be unenforceable under the PRC Property Rights Law. Until such pledge interests are registered, they are not considered perfected under the PRC law. Consequently, if any individual shareholder of our consolidated affiliated entities breaches his or her obligations under the contractual arrangements with respect to these entities while the relevant equity pledges are not registered, there is a risk that our PRC subsidiaries may not be able to successfully enforce the equity pledges and would need to resort to legal proceedings to enforce their contractual rights. As a result of Shanda Interactives controlling ownership interest, Shanda Interactive will effectively control the outcome of shareholder actions in our company and may take actions that might not be beneficial to you as a holder of our ADSs. As of December 31, 2012, Shanda Interactive beneficially held 3,334,694,602 ordinary shares, representing 70.5% of the voting power in our company. Shanda Interactives ownership interest gives it the power to control any actions that require shareholder approval under Cayman Islands law, our memorandum and articles of association, or the NASDAQ listing requirements, including the election and removal of any member of our board of directors, mergers, consolidations and other business combinations, changes to our memorandum and articles of association, the number of shares available for issuance under equity incentive plans and the issuance of significant amounts of our ordinary shares in private placements. Shanda Interactives voting power may prevent a transaction involving a change of control of us, including transactions in which you as a holder of our ADSs might otherwise receive a premium for your securities over the then-current market price. Similarly, Shanda Interactive may approve a merger or consolidation of our company which may result in you receiving a stake (either in the form of shares, debt obligations or other securities) in the surviving or new consolidated company which may not operate our current business model and dissenter rights may not be available to you in such an event. We may have conflicts of interest with Shanda Interactive or its affiliates. Because of Shanda Interactives controlling ownership interest in our company, we may not be able to resolve such conflicts on terms favorable to us. As of December 31, 2012, Shanda Interactive beneficially owned approximately 70.5% of our outstanding equity interests. Conflicts of interest may arise between Shanda Interactive and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships. In addition to the conflicts of interests we have discussed in other risk factors, potential conflicts of interest that we have identified include the following: 19 Table of Contents · Our board members or executive officers may have conflicts of interest. Mr. Tianqiao Chen and Mr. Danian Chen, who are our directors, currently also serve as directors or officers of Shanda Interactive. Some of our directors also own equity interests in Shanda Interactive. Our board members may receive incentive share compensation from Shanda Games Limited, a subsidiary of Shanda Interactive, from time to time. These relationships could create perceived or actual conflicts of interest when these persons are faced with decisions with potentially different implications for Shanda Interactive and us. · Agreements with Shanda Interactive and its affiliates. The various agreements that we entered into with Shanda Interactive and its affiliates, including the loan agreements with Shanda Games Limited and its consolidated affiliated entities in China, the advertising agency services agreement with Shengyue and other transactions described under Item 7. B. Related Party Transactions, may be less favorable to us than would be the case if they were negotiated with third parties. Moreover, Shanda Interactive may use its control over us to prevent us from bringing a legal claim against it in the event of a contractual breach, notwithstanding our contractual rights under the agreements and any other agreement we may enter into with Shanda Interactive and its affiliates from time to time. · Potential competition with Shanda Interactive. Shanda Interactive may engage in certain transactions or businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our online video and audio business. In particular, we rely on advertising agency services provided by Shengyue, an affiliate wholly owned by Shanda Interactive. Shengyue may provide similar services to some of our competitors, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. · Business opportunities. Business opportunities may arise that both we and Shanda Interactive find attractive, and which would complement our respective businesses. Due to the controlling interest of Shanda Interactive and its leading market position and brand in China, we may not be able to pursue these business opportunities effectively if Shanda Interactive decides to take advantage of such opportunities itself. · Developing business relationships with Shanda Interactives competitors. So long as Shanda Interactive remains our controlling shareholder, we may be limited in our ability to do business with its competitors, such as other companies that engage in online video, online literature or online game businesses. Although our company is a stand-alone entity, we expect to operate, for as long as Shanda Interactive is our controlling shareholder, as a part of the Shanda Group. Shanda Interactive may from time to time make strategic decisions that it believes are in the best interests of Shanda Group as a whole. These decisions may be different from the decisions that we would have made on our own. Shanda Interactives decisions with respect to us or our business may be resolved in ways that favor Shanda Interactive and therefore Shanda Interactives own shareholders, which may not coincide with the interests of our other shareholders. We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and even if we do so, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated shareholder. Even if both parties seek to transact business on terms intended to approximate those that could have been achieved among unaffiliated parties, this may not succeed in practice. Risks Related to Doing Business in China Substantially all of our assets are located in China and substantially all of our revenues are derived from our operations in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are subject, to a significant extent, to economic, political and legal conditions and developments in China. The PRC legal system embodies uncertainties which could limit the legal protections available to you and could also adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it is a system in which decided legal cases have little precedential value. Although legislation in China over the past 20 years has significantly improved the protection afforded to various forms of foreign investment and contractual arrangements in China, these laws, regulations and legal requirements are relatively new and their interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties, which could limit the legal protection available to us, and foreign investors, including you. In addition, the PRC government may enact new laws or amend current laws that may be detrimental to our current contractual arrangements with respect to our consolidated affiliated entities, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. 20 Table of Contents PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to liability or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect us. In October 2005, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the PRC, or SAFE, issued the Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fundraising and Return Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, which became effective as of November 1, 2005, and which was supplemented by an implementing notice issued on November 24, 2005. Subsequently, SAFE issued a series of implementation rules and guidance, including the Implementing Rules Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-Raising and Round-trip Investment Activities of the Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, which became effective as of July 1, 2011, and Notice on Further Adjustments to Measures for the Administration of Foreign Exchange for Direct Investment, which became effective on December 17, 2012. We refer to them collectively as Circular 75. Under Circular 75, PRC residents and citizens must register with the relevant local SAFE branch prior to their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of an overseas equity financing involving onshore assets or equity interests held by them, and must also make filings with SAFE thereafter upon the occurrence of certain material capital changes. The registration and filing procedures under Circular 75 are prerequisites for other approval and registration procedures necessary for capital inflow from the offshore entity, such as inbound investments or shareholders loans, or capital outflow to the offshore entity, such as the payment of profits or dividends, liquidating distributions, equity sale proceeds or the return of funds upon a capital reduction. Circular 75 also requires that if a PRC resident has established or gained control of an SPV and completed the return investment prior to the implementation of this Circular 75 but failed to complete the foreign exchange registration in relation with its overseas investment, it shall carry out such registrations with the local branch of SAFE in accordance with this Circular 75 by March 31, 2006. After the PRC resident has retroactively completed the foreign exchange registration in relation with its overseas investment, the local branch of SAFE may process the registration pertaining to foreign investment and foreign debt for the relevant PRC enterprises. The failure or inability of our shareholders who are PRC citizens or PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in these regulations may subject us to fines or legal sanctions, restrictions on our cross-border investment activities or our PRC subsidiaries ability to distribute dividends to, or obtain foreign-exchange-dominated loans from, our company, or prevent us from making distributions or paying dividends. As a result, our business operations and our ability to make distributions to you could be materially and adversely affected. The failure to comply with the regulations regarding the use of the foreign currency registered capital may subject us to severe monetary or other penalties. On August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign Invested Enterprises, or Circular 142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested enterprise of foreign currency registered capital into Renminbi by restricting how the converted Renminbi may be used. Circular 142 provides that the Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within China, unless it is provided for otherwise. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested company. The use of such Renminbi capital may not be altered without SAFE approval, and such Renminbi capital may not in any case be used to repay Renminbi loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Failure to comply with Circular 142 could result in liabilities for such PRC subsidiaries under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions, including (i) being required to take appropriate remedial action, confiscation of any illegal income and imposition of a fine of up to 30% of the illegal amount involved and (2) in circumstances involving serious violations, a fine of between 30% and 100% of the illegal amount involved shall be imposed on the organization or individual concerned. If we are found to violate Circular 142 or other laws in relation with foreign exchange, we may be subject to severe monetary or other penalties. 21 Table of Contents All participants of our existing equity compensation plans who are PRC domestic individuals are required to register with SAFE, and the failure to so comply could subject us and such participants to penalties. On February 15, 2012, SAFE issued the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Publicly-Listed Company, or Circular 7, which replaced the Operating Procedures for Administration of Domestic Individuals Participating in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan or Stock Option Plan of an Overseas Listed Company issued by SAFE on March 28, 2007. According to Circular 7, domestic individuals, which include PRC residents and non-PRC residents who reside in China for a continuous period of not less than one year other than foreign diplomatic personnel and representatives of international organizations, are required to register with SAFE and complete certain other procedures if such individuals participate in an employee stock ownership plan or a stock option plan in a publicly listed overseas company. These participants should retain a PRC agent, which can be a subsidiary of the overseas listed company in China, to handle various foreign exchange matters associated with these plans. They must also retain an overseas entrusted institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of stock options and their purchase and sale of stocks. The PRC agent of a PRC domestic individual participant must apply for the approval of an annual allowance if such participant needs to use funds in China in connection with the stock incentive plan. The PRC agent is also required to submit a filing form with respect to the stock incentive plan at the beginning of each quarter. The foreign exchange proceeds received by the PRC domestic individual participants from the sale of shares under the stock option plans granted by the overseas listed companies must be remitted into the bank accounts in China opened by their employers or PRC agents. We and our PRC domestic individual employees who have been granted share options will be subject to these rules. While we have completed the required registration of our 2010 Equity Compensation Plan, or the 2010 Plan, with the Tianjin Branch of SAFE in November 2012, we cannot assure you that all future participants will register with SAFE in a timely manner, or at all. Any failure to comply with such regulations may subject us and the participants of our equity compensation plans who are PRC citizens to fines and legal sanctions and prevent us from being able to grant equity compensation to our personnel which is currently a significant component of the compensation of many of our PRC employees, as a result of which our business operations may be adversely affected. The PRC tax authorities enhanced scrutiny of PRC enterprise income tax on offshore equity transfers may have a negative impact on your investment in our ADSs. In connection with the EIT Law, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation jointly issued the Notice on Issues Concerning Process of Enterprise Income Tax in Enterprise Restructuring Business, or Circular 59, in April 2009. On December 10, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice Concerning the Strengthening of Enterprise Income Tax Administration with Respect to Equity Transfers by Non-resident Enterprises, or Circular 698. Both Circular 59 and Circular 698 became effective retroactively as of January 1, 2008. By promulgating and implementing these circulars, the PRC tax authorities have enhanced their scrutiny over the direct or indirect transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise by a non-PRC resident enterprise. The PRC tax authorities have the discretion under Circular 698 to make adjustments to the taxable capital gains based on the difference between the fair value of the equity interests transferred and the cost of investment. Under Circular 698, when a non-PRC resident enterprise directly or indirectly transfers an equity interest in a PRC-resident enterprise and enterprise income tax on the capital gains from such transfer is not withheld, such non-PRC tax resident must file a tax return with the PRC tax authorities and pay tax on the capital gains. Thus, our investors that are non-PRC resident enterprises may be required by the PRC tax authorities to make a filing upon the transfer of our ADSs or ordinary shares, and may be required to pay PRC tax on gains realized from such transfer at a rate of 10% even if we are not treated as a PRC resident enterprise. We may be deemed a PRC resident enterprise under the EIT Law and be subject to PRC taxation on our worldwide income. The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, includes a provision specifying that legal entities organized outside China will be considered residents for PRC income tax purposes if their place of effective management or control is within China. If legal entities organized outside China were considered residents for PRC income tax purposes, they would be subject to the 25% enterprise income tax imposed by the EIT Law on their worldwide income. The implementation rules to the EIT Law provide that non-resident legal entities will be considered China residents if substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting, properties, etc. reside within China. Although substantially all of our operational management is currently based in China, it is uncertain whether our company and our offshore intermediate holding company would be deemed as PRC tax resident enterprises under the EIT Law and other related PRC laws and regulations. If our company and our offshore intermediate holding company were deemed as PRC tax resident enterprises and have earned income other than dividends from our PRC subsidiaries, a 25% enterprise income tax on our global income could increase our tax burden and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. 22 Table of Contents Dividends that we receive from our PRC subsidiaries are subject to PRC withholding tax. In accordance with the EIT Law and its implementation rules, dividends which arise from profits of foreign invested enterprises earned after January 1, 2008 are subject to a 10% withholding tax. As of December 31, 2012, our PRC subsidiaries had no undistributed earnings available for distribution. In addition, our company does not have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future and we intend to retain most of our available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business in China. Accordingly, no provision has been made for the PRC dividend withholding taxes that would be payable upon distributions of dividends by our PRC subsidiaries to us. Any future dividends that our company receives from our PRC subsidiaries will be subject to PRC withholding tax. The enforcement of the PRC labor contract law may materially increase our costs and decrease our net income. The PRC National Peoples Congress promulgated the Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008. Compared to previous labor laws, the Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules provides stronger protection for employees and imposes more stringent obligations on employers with regard to, among others, minimum wages, severance payments upon permitted termination of employment by an employer and non-fixed term employment contracts, time limits for probation period as well as the duration and the times that an employee can be placed on a fixed-term employment contract. Due to the limited period of effectiveness of the Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules, and the lack of clarity with respect to their implementation and potential penalties and fines, it is uncertain how they will impact our current employment policies and practices. Compliance with the Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules may increase our operating expenses, in particular our personnel expenses. In the event that we decide to terminate some of our employees or otherwise change our employment or labor practices, the Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules may also limit our ability to effect those changes in a manner that we believe to be cost-effective or desirable, and could result in a material decrease in our profitability. Furthermore, a significant number of our employees are contracted through third-party human resources companies that are responsible for managing, among others, payrolls, social insurance contributions and local residency permits of these employees. We may be held jointly liable if such human resources companies fail to pay such employees their wages and other benefits or otherwise become liable to these employees for labor law violations. Our failure to make adequate contributions to various employee benefit plans as required by PRC regulations may subject us to penalties. We are required by PRC laws and regulations to participate in various government-sponsored employee benefit plans, including social insurance funds (namely a pension contribution plan, a medical insurance plan, an unemployment insurance plan, a work-related injury insurance plan and a maternity insurance plan) and a housing provident fund and contribute to the plans in amounts equal to certain percentages of salaries, including bonuses and allowances, of our employees up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time at locations where we operate our businesses. Employers who fail to report and pay social insurance funds in accordance with the relevant rules may be ordered to rectify the problem and pay the social insurance funds within a stipulated deadline. According to the Interim Regulation on the Collection and Payment of Social Insurance Premiums, if payment of certain social insurance funds is not made by the stipulated deadline, the relevant authority can charge a late fee payment of 0.2% per day from the original due date and fine the responsible persons of the employer up to RMB10,000. If an employer is found to be concealing the actual number of employees or the total amount of salaries from competent social insurance authorities, the employer may be subject to penalties. According to relevant PRC laws, for the failure to register or open housing provident fund accounts for employees, the employer may be required to rectify such breach within certain period and if such breach persists after such period, the employer may be subject to a fine ranging from RMB10,000 to RMB50,000. For the failure of payment of housing provident fund and failure to rectify such breach within certain period prescribed by the relevant authorities, the relevant housing provident fund authorities may apply for a court order requiring employers to make such payment. 23 Table of Contents PRC regulation of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies in PRC entities may limit us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC operating subsidiaries or our consolidated affiliated entities. As the offshore holding company of our PRC subsidiaries, we have historically financed, and may continue to finance, our PRC subsidiaries by extending loans or making additional capital contributions to them. Any loans to our PRC subsidiaries are subject to PRC regulations. For example, loans by us to finance the operations of any of our PRC subsidiaries which is a foreign-invested enterprise may not exceed statutory limits and are required to be registered with SAFE. We may also need to increase the registered capital of our PRC subsidiaries or finance them through capital contributions. Such changes and capital contributions must be approved by MOFCOM or its local branches. Our ability to use the U.S. dollar proceeds of the sale of our equity or debt to finance our business activities conducted through our PRC subsidiaries will depend on our ability to obtain these governmental registrations or approvals. In addition, because of the regulatory issues related to foreign currency loans to, and foreign investment in, domestic PRC enterprises, we may not be able to finance the operation of our consolidated affiliated entities in China by loans or capital contributions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government approvals on a timely basis, if at all. If we fail to obtain such approvals, our ability to finance our PRC subsidiary and to expand our operations in China may be severely restricted, and could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively. Substantially all of our revenues and operating expenses are denominated in Renminbi. The PRC government imposes controls on currency conversion between Renminbi and foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of and into China. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including payment of dividends, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior SAFE approval by complying with certain procedural requirements. Our PRC subsidiaries may also retain foreign exchange in their current accounts, subject to a ceiling approved by SAFE, to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. In addition, approval of the appropriate governmental authorities is required if Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of offshore bank loans denominated in foreign currencies. However, we cannot assure you that the relevant PRC governmental authorities will not limit or eliminate our ability to purchase and retain foreign currencies in the future. Under our current corporate structure, the income of our company will be primarily derived from dividend payments from Beijing WFOE and Tianjin WFOE. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of Beijing WFOE and Tianjin WFOE to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends to us, or otherwise satisfy its foreign currency-dominated obligations. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by a severe and prolonged global economic downturn and a corresponding slowdown of the PRC economy. Recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging and have caused persisting recession in most major economies in 2008 and 2009 and significant market volatility since 2010. Continued concerns about the systemic impact of a potentially long-term and widespread recession, energy costs, geopolitical issues and the availability and cost of credit have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for economic growth around the world. The difficult economic outlook has negatively affected business and consumer confidence and contributed to volatility at unprecedented levels. The PRC economy also faces challenges. Since we derive substantially all of our revenues in China, any prolonged slowdown in the growth of the PRC economy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Disruptions of the financial markets could also significantly restrict our ability to obtain financing in the capital markets or from financial institutions. 24 Table of Contents Changes in Chinas political and economic policies could harm our business. The economy of China has historically been a planned economy subject to governmental plans and quotas and has, in certain aspects, been transitioning to a more market-oriented economy. Although we believe that the economic reform and the macroeconomic measures adopted by the PRC government have had a positive effect on the economic development of China, we cannot predict the future direction of these economic reforms or the effects these measures may have on our business, financial position or results of operations. In addition, the PRC economy differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. These differences include: · economic structure; · level of government involvement in the economy; · level of development; · level of capital reinvestment; · control of foreign exchange; · methods of allocating resources; and · balance of payments position. As a result of these differences, our business may not develop in the same way or at the same rate as might be expected if the PRC economy were similar to those of the OECD member countries. Inflation in China and measures to contain inflation could negatively affect our profitability and growth. While the PRC economy has experienced rapid growth, such growth has been uneven among various sectors of the economy and in different geographical areas of the country. Rapid economic growth can lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. If prices for our advertising services rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for the rise in our costs, our business may be materially and adversely affected. In order to control inflation in the past, the PRC government has imposed controls on bank credits, limits on loans for fixed assets and restrictions on state bank lending. Such austerity measures can lead to a slowing of economic growth. A slowdown in the PRC economy could also materially and adversely affect our business and prospects. The audit report included in this annual report was prepared by auditors who are not inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and, as such, you are deprived of the benefits of such inspections. Auditors of companies that are registered with the SEC and traded publicly in the United States, including our independent registered public accounting firm, must be registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or the PCAOB, and are required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess their compliance with the laws of the United States and professional standards. Because our auditors are located in the Peoples Republic of China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities, our auditors are not currently inspected by the PCAOB. This lack of PCAOB inspections in China prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating audits and quality control procedures of any auditors operating in China, including our auditors. As a result, investors in our ADSs may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditors audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to other public company auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections. As a result, investors in our ADSs may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements. Any occurrence of pandemic avian influenza or other widespread public health problem, or any recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. An outbreak of pandemic avian influenza or other widespread public health problem, or a renewed outbreak of SARS in China, where most of our revenues are derived, and in Beijing, where our operations are headquartered, could have a negative effect on our operations. There have been recent reports of outbreaks of an avian flu caused by the H7N9 virus, including confirmed human cases, in China. Our operations may be affected by a number of health-related factors, including the following: 25 Table of Contents · quarantines or closures of some of our offices which would severely disrupt our operations, · the sickness or death of our key officers and employees, and · a general slowdown in the PRC economy caused by any public health problems. Any of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences of public health problems could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Risks Related to Our ADSs The price of our ADSs has been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile, which may make it difficult for holders to resell the ADSs when desired or at attractive prices. The trading price of our ADSs has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. The sale price of our ADSs on the NASDAQ Global Market ranged from $0.90 to $4.04 per ADS in 2012 and the last reported sale price on April 18, 2013 was $1.00. Our ADS price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including among other factors: · announcements of technological or competitive developments; · regulatory developments in our target markets affecting us, our customers or our competitors; · announcements of share repurchase program; · actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results; · changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts; · changes in the economic performance or market valuations of our website; · addition or departure of our executive officers and key research personnel; and · sales or perceived sales of additional ordinary shares or ADSs. In addition, the financial markets in general, and the market prices for Internet-related companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our ADSs, regardless of our operating performance. Future sales or perceived sales of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares or ADSs by our controlling shareholder could adversely affect the price of our ADSs. If our controlling shareholder sells, or is perceived as intending to sell, substantial amounts of our ordinary shares or ADSs, including those issued upon the exercise of our outstanding stock options, the market price of our ADSs could fall. Such sales, or perceived potential sales, by our controlling shareholder might make it more difficult for us to issue new equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and place we deem appropriate. If our controlling shareholder sells a substantial amount of ordinary shares it currently holds, the prevailing market price for our ADSs could be adversely affected. As a foreign private issuer with ADSs listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, we follow home country corporate governance practices instead of certain NASDAQ requirements. As a foreign private issuer whose ADSs are listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, we are permitted to follow home country corporate governance practices instead of certain NASDAQ requirements. A foreign private issuer that elects to follow its home country practice must submit to the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC a written statement from an independent counsel in such issuers home country certifying that the issuers practices are not prohibited by the home countrys laws. In addition, a foreign private issuer must disclose in its annual reports filed with the SEC each NASDAQ requirement with which it does not comply followed by a description of its applicable home country practice. 26 Table of Contents As a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with ADSs listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, we intend to follow our home country practice instead of NASDAQ requirements that mandate that: · our board of directors be comprised of a majority of independent directors; · our directors be selected or nominated by a majority of the independent directors or a nomination committee comprised solely of independent directors; · our board adopt a formal written charter or board resolution addressing the director nominations process and such related matters as may be required under the U.S. federal securities laws; · the compensation of our executive officers be determined or recommended by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors; and · issuances of securities in connection with equity-based compensation of officers, directors, employees or consultants be approved by shareholders. As we are a Cayman Islands company, our shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests, and our ability to protect our rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited. Our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association, by the Cayman Companies Law and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders, and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law in the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedents in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law in this area may not be as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in existence in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and some states, such as Delaware, have more developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate laws. Moreover, under the Cayman Companies Law, for mergers and consolidations involving two Cayman Islands companies or a Cayman Islands company and an overseas company, dissenting shareholders have the right to be paid the fair value of their shares (which, if not agreed to by the parties, will be determined by the Cayman Islands court) if they follow the required procedures, subject to certain exceptions, and such rights may not be comparable to the appraisal rights that would ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of a U.S. company. Finally, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate shareholder derivative actions before any federal court of the United States. As a result, our shareholders may have more difficulties in protecting their interests in the face of actions by our management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a public company incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States. Our shareholders may have difficulties in enforcing judgments obtained against us. We are a Cayman Islands company and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States. Substantially all of our current operations are conducted in China. In addition, most of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than the United States. A substantial portion of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for our shareholders to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. It may also be difficult for our shareholders to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors, most of whom are not residents in the United States and the substantial majority of whose assets are located outside of the United States. There is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state due to the lack of reciprocal treaty in the PRC providing statutory recognition of judgments obtained in the United States. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether such PRC courts would be competent to hear original actions brought in the PRC against us or such persons who reside outside the United States predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state. 27 Table of Contents Although there is some uncertainty as to the enforcement in the Cayman Islands, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of United States courts, of liabilities predicated upon U.S. federal securities laws, a final and conclusive judgment in personam of a competent foreign court, including a competent United States court, against our company based upon the agreements under which a definite sum of money is payable other than a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature of a fine or other similar penalty, may be the subject of enforcement proceedings in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands under the common law doctrine of obligation by action on the debt evidenced by the judgment of such competent foreign court. A final opinion as to the availability of this remedy should be sought when the facts surrounding the foreign courts judgment are known, but, on general principles, it would be expected that such proceedings be successful provided that (a) the court which gave the judgment was competent to hear the action in accordance with private international law principles as applied in the Cayman Islands and (b) the judgment is not contrary to public policy in Cayman Islands, has not been obtained by fraud or in proceedings contrary to natural justice and is not based on an error in Cayman Islands law. Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents may discourage our acquisition by a third party, which could limit your opportunity to sell your shares at a premium. Our memorandum and articles of association include provisions that could limit the ability of others to acquire control of us, modify our structure or cause us to engage in change of control transactions, including, among other things, provisions that authorize our board of directors, without action by our shareholders, to issue preferred shares and to issue additional ordinary shares, including ordinary shares represented by ADSs. These provisions could have the effect of depriving you of an opportunity to sell your ADSs at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to acquire control of us in a tender offer or similar transactions. The voting rights of holders of ADSs are limited by the terms of the deposit agreement. A holder of our ADSs may only exercise the voting rights with respect to the underlying ordinary shares in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement. Upon receipt of voting instructions of a holder of ADSs in the manner set forth in the deposit agreement, the depositary will endeavor to vote the underlying ordinary shares in accordance with these instructions. Under our memorandum and articles of association and Cayman Islands law, the minimum notice period required for convening a general meeting is five days. When a general meeting is convened, you may not receive sufficient notice of a general meeting to permit you to withdraw your ordinary shares to allow you to cast your vote with respect to any specific matter. In addition, the depositary and its agents may not be able to send voting instructions to you or carry out your voting instructions in a timely manner. We will make all reasonable efforts to cause the depositary to extend voting rights to you in a timely manner, but we cannot assure you that you will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that you can instruct the depositary to vote your shares. Furthermore, the depositary and its agents will not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instructions to vote, for the manner in which any vote is cast, or for the effect of any such vote. As a result, you may not be able to exercise your right to vote and you may lack recourse if your ordinary shares are not voted as you requested. We may be required to withhold PRC income tax on the dividends we pay you (if any), and any gain you realize on the transfer of our ordinary shares and ADSs may also be subject to PRC tax if we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Pursuant to the EIT Law, we may be treated as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. See Risks Related to Doing Business in ChinaWe may be deemed a PRC resident enterprise under the EIT Law and be subject to PRC taxation on our worldwide income above. If we were so treated by the PRC tax authorities, we would be obligated to withhold PRC income tax on payments of dividends on our ordinary shares and ADSs to investors that are non-resident enterprises, provided that such dividends are deemed as China-sourced income. A non-resident enterprise is an enterprise that does not have an establishment or place of business in China or that has such establishment or place of business but its income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business. In addition, any gain realized by investors that are non-resident enterprises from the transfer of our ordinary shares or ADSs may be deemed as China-sourced income and generally be subject to PRC tax. Such dividends and gains to investors that are non-resident enterprises would generally be subject to a 10% PRC withholding tax, unless a reduced tax rate is provided by any applicable tax treaty and the holders have completed the relevant procedures prescribed by the PRC tax authorities to prove their beneficial owner status. 28 Table of Contents Moreover, under the PRC Individual Income Tax Law, or the IITL, if we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise, non-resident individual investors would be subject to PRC individual income tax on dividends paid to such investors and any capital gains realized from the transfer of our ordinary shares and ADSs, provided that such dividends and gains are deemed as China-sourced income. A non-resident individual is an individual who has no domicile in China and does not stay within China or has stayed within China for less than one year. Pursuant to the IITL and its implementation rules, for purposes of the PRC capital gains tax, the taxable income will be based on the total income obtained from the transfer of our ordinary shares or ADSs after deducting all the costs and expenses that are permitted under PRC tax laws to be deducted from the income. If we were considered a PRC resident enterprise and dividends paid with respect to our ordinary shares and ADSs and the gains realized from the transfer of our ordinary shares and ADSs were considered China-sourced income by relevant PRC tax authorities, such dividends and gains earned by non-resident individuals would generally be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 20%, unless a reduced tax rate is provided by any applicable tax treaty and the holders have completed the relevant procedures prescribed by the PRC tax authorities to prove their beneficial owner status. The foregoing PRC taxes may reduce your investment return on our ordinary shares and ADSs and may also affect the price of our ordinary shares and ADSs. You may be subject to limitations on transfer of your ADSs. Your ADSs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties. The depositary may close its books for a number of reasons, including in connection with corporate events such as a rights offering, during which time the depositary needs to maintain an exact number of ADS holders on its books for a specified period. The depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer, or register transfers of our ADSs generally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary thinks it is advisable to do so because of any requirement of law, any government, governmental body or commission or the NASDAQ Global Market, or under any provision of the deposit agreement, or because of a meeting of shareholders of our company, or for any other reason. Your right as a holder of ADSs to participate in any future rights offerings may be limited, which may cause dilution to your holdings. We may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities. However, we cannot make rights available to our ADS holders in the United States unless we register the rights and the securities to which the rights relate under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements is available. In addition, the deposit agreement provides that the depositary bank will not make rights available to you unless the distribution to ADS holders of both the rights and any related securities are either registered under the Securities Act or exempted from registration under the Securities Act. We are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or securities or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective nor is it our current intention to do so. Moreover, we may not be able to rely on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, ADS holders may be unable to participate in future rights offerings, if any, and may experience dilution in their holdings. In addition, if the depositary is unable to sell rights that are not exercised or not distributed or if the sale is not lawful or reasonably practicable, it will allow the rights to lapse, in which case you will receive no value for these rights. We may be adversely affected by the outcome of the administrative proceedings brought by the SEC against five accounting firms in China. The SEC has brought administrative proceedings against five accounting firms in China recently alleging that they refused to produce audit work papers and other documents related to certain China-based companies under investigation by the SEC for potential accounting fraud. We were not and are not subject to any SEC investigations, nor are we involved in the proceedings brought by the SEC against the accounting firms. However, the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit reports included in our annual reports filed with the SEC is one of the five accounting firms named in the SECs proceedings and we may be adversely affected by the outcome of the proceedings, along with other U.S. listed companies audited by these accounting firms. If the SEC prevails in the proceedings, our independent registered public accounting firm and the other four accounting firms in China that were named in the proceedings may be barred from practicing before the SEC and hence unable to continue to be the auditors for China-based companies listed in the United States like us. If none of the China-based auditors are able to continue to be auditors for China-based companies listed in the United States, we will not be able to meet the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act, which may ultimately result in our deregistration by the SEC and delisting from the NASDAQ Global Market. 29 Table of Contents
