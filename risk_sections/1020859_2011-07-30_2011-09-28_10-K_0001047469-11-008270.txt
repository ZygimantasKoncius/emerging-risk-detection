ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section discusses factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties applicable to our business. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsForward-Looking Statements." We depend heavily on our principal customer and our success is heavily dependent on our principal customer's ability to grow its business. Whole Foods Market accounted for approximately 36% of our net sales in fiscal 2011. We serve as the primary distributor of natural, organic and specialty non-perishable products to Whole Foods Market in all of its regions in the United States under the terms of our amended distribution agreement which expires on September 25, 2020. Our ability to maintain a close mutually beneficial relationship with Whole Foods Market is an important element to our continued growth. The loss or cancellation of business from Whole Foods Market, including from increased distribution to their own facilities or closures of stores, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Similarly, if Whole Foods Market is not able to grow its business, including as a result of a reduction in the level of discretionary spending by its customers, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Our operations are sensitive to economic downturns. The grocery industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions and the demand for the products that we distribute, particularly our specialty products, may be adversely affected from time to time by economic downturns that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Future economic conditions such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, inflation rates, energy and fuel costs and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits. Among these changes could be a reduction in the number of natural and organic products that consumers purchase where there are non-organic, which we refer to as conventional, alternatives, given that many natural and organic products, and particularly natural and organic foods, often have higher retail prices than do their conventional counterparts. Our business is a low margin business and our profit margins may decrease due to consolidation in the grocery industry. The grocery distribution industry generally is characterized by relatively high volume of sales with relatively low profit margins. The continuing consolidation of retailers in the natural products industry and the growth of supernatural chains may reduce our profit margins in the future as more customers qualify for greater volume discounts, and we experience pricing pressures from suppliers and retailers. Over the last two fiscal years, we have increased our sales to our supernatural chain and conventional supermarket customers in relation to our total sales. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we announced that we had entered into a three-year distribution arrangement to supply Safeway with nonproprietary natural, organic and specialty products, which will further increase the percentage of our total sales to conventional supermarkets. Sales to these customers within our supernatural chain and conventional 16 Table of Contents supermarket channels generate a lower gross margin than do sales to our independent customers. Many of these customers, including our largest customer, have agreements with us that include volume discounts. As the amounts these customers purchase from us increase, the price that they pay for the products they purchase is reduced, putting downward pressure on our gross margins on these sales. To compensate for these lower gross margins, we must reduce the expenses we incur to service these customers. If we are unable to reduce our expenses, including our expenses related to servicing this lower gross margin business, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted. Our business may be sensitive to inflationary and deflationary pressures. Many of our sales are at prices that are based on our product cost plus a percentage markup. As a result, volatile food costs have a direct impact upon our profitability. Prolonged periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our profit margins and results of operations to the extent that we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers. In addition, product cost inflation may negatively impact the consumer discretionary spending trends of our customers' customers, which could adversely affect our sales. Conversely, because many of our sales are at prices that are based upon product cost plus a percentage markup, our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit as a percentage of net sales may remain relatively constant. To compensate for lower gross margins, we, in turn, must reduce expenses that we incur to service our customers. Our customers generally are not obligated to continue purchasing products from us. Many of our customers buy from us under purchase orders, and we generally do not have agreements with or commitments from these customers for the purchase of products. We cannot assure you that our customers will maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for the products supplied by us or that we will be able to maintain or add to our existing customer base. Decreases in our customers' sales volumes or orders for products supplied by us may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have significant competition from a variety of sources. We operate in competitive markets and our future success will be largely dependent on our ability to provide quality products and services at competitive prices. Bidding for contracts or arrangements with customers, particularly within the supernatural chain and conventional supermarket channels, is highly competitive and distributors may market their services to a particular customer over a long period of time before they are invited to bid. Our competition comes from a variety of sources, including other distributors of natural products as well as specialty grocery and mass market grocery distributors and retail customers that have their own distribution channels. We cannot assure you that mass market grocery distributors will not increase their emphasis on natural products and more directly compete with us including through self-distribution of particular items or purchases of particular items directly from suppliers or that new competitors will not enter the market. These distributors may have been in business longer than we have, may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may be better established in their markets. We cannot assure you that our current or potential competitors will not provide products or services comparable or superior to those provided by us or adapt more quickly than we do to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements. It is also possible that alliances among competitors may develop and rapidly acquire significant market share or that certain of our customers will increase distribution to their own retail facilities. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. 17 Table of Contents Our investment in information technology may not result in the anticipated benefits. Much of our sales growth is occurring in our lower gross margin supernatural and conventional supermarket channels. In our attempt to reduce operating expenses and increase operating efficiencies, we have aggressively invested in the development and implementation of new information technology. Due to start-up inefficiencies associated with the initial implementation of our technological initiatives in our Lancaster, Texas distribution facility, we have revised the timeline for the broader implementation of our proposed technological developments. While we currently believe this revised timeline will be met, we may not be able to implement these technological changes in the time frame that we have planned and delays in implementation could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the costs to make these changes may exceed our estimates and will exceed the benefits during the early stages of implementation. Even if we are able to implement the changes in accordance with our revised plans, and within our current cost estimates, we may not be able achieve the expected efficiencies and cost savings from this investment, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Failure by us to develop and operate a reliable technology platform could negatively impact our business. Our ability to decrease costs and increase profits, as well as our ability to serve customers most effectively, depends on the reliability of our technology platform. We use software and other technology systems, among other things, to generate and select orders, to load and route trucks and to monitor and manage our business on a day-to-day basis. Any disruption to these computer systems could adversely impact our customer service, decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs negatively affecting our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have experienced losses due to the uncollectability of accounts receivable in the past and could experience increases in such losses in the future if our customers are unable to timely pay their debts to us. Certain of our customers have from time to time experienced bankruptcy, insolvency and/or an inability to pay their debts to us as they come due. If our customers suffer significant financial difficulty, they may be unable to pay their debts to us timely or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. It is possible that customers may reject their contractual obligations to us under bankruptcy laws or otherwise. Significant customer bankruptcies could further adversely affect our revenues and increase our operating expenses by requiring larger provisions for bad debt. In addition, even when our contracts with these customers are not rejected, if customers are unable to meet their obligations on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our ability to collect receivables. Further, we may have to negotiate significant discounts and/or extended financing terms with these customers in such a situation, each of which could have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. During periods of economic weakness like those we experienced during fiscal 2009 and the first half of fiscal 2010, small to medium-sized businesses, like many of our independently owned natural products retailer customers, may be impacted more severely and more quickly than larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of such businesses to repay their obligations to us may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our acquisition strategy may adversely affect our business and our recent expansion into Canada may not be successful. In June 2010, we entered the Canadian market with UNFI Canada's acquisition of the SDG assets of SunOpta, which we refer to as the SunOpta Transaction. We cannot assure you that our subsequent growth, if any, in the Canadian market will enhance our financial performance. Our ability to achieve 18 Table of Contents the expected benefits of this acquisition will depend on, among other things, our ability to effectively translate our business strategies into a new geographic market with more rigid ingredient requirements for the products we distribute and an English and French dual labeling requirement that reduces the number of products we are likely to sell in comparison to the United States market, our ability to retain customers and suppliers, the adequacy of our implementation plans, our ability to maintain our financial and internal controls and systems as we expand within Canada, the ability of our management to oversee and operate effectively the combined operations and our ability to achieve desired operating efficiencies and sales goals. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in a reduction in the price of our common stock as well as in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy and could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. A significant portion of our past growth has been achieved through acquisitions of, or mergers with, other distributors of natural, organic and specialty products. We also continually evaluate opportunities to acquire other companies. We believe that there are risks related to acquiring companies, including an inability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate such potential acquisitions. To the extent that our future growth includes acquisitions, we cannot assure you that we will not overpay for acquisitions, lose key employees of acquired companies, fail to achieve potential synergies or expansion into new markets as a result of our acquisitions. Therefore, future acquisitions, if any, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly in periods immediately following the consummation of those transactions while the operations of the acquired business are being integrated with our operations. Achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends on timely, efficient and successful execution of a number of post-acquisition events, including, among other things: maintaining the customer base; optimizing delivery routes; coordinating administrative, distribution and finance functions; and integrating management information systems and personnel. The integration process could divert the attention of management and any difficulties or problems encountered in the transition process could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In particular, the integration process may temporarily redirect resources previously focused on reducing product cost, resulting in lower gross profits in relation to sales. In addition, the process of combining companies could cause the interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the respective businesses, which could have an adverse effect on their combined operations. In connection with acquisitions of businesses in the future, if any, we may decide to consolidate the operations of any acquired business with our existing operations or make other changes with respect to the acquired business, which could result in special charges or other expenses. Our results of operations also may be adversely affected by expenses we incur in making acquisitions, by amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets with definite lives and by additional depreciation attributable to acquired assets. Any of the businesses we acquire may also have liabilities or adverse operating issues, including some that we fail to discover before the acquisition, and our indemnity for such liabilities may also be limited. Additionally, our ability to make any future acquisitions may depend upon obtaining additional financing. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. To the extent that we seek to acquire other businesses in exchange for our common stock, fluctuations in our stock price could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete acquisitions. 19 Table of Contents We may have difficulty managing our growth. The growth in the size of our business and operations has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on our management. Our future growth may be limited by our inability to acquire new distribution facilities or expand our existing distribution facilities, make acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired entities or significant new customers, implement information systems initiatives or adequately manage our personnel. Our future growth is limited in part by the size and location of our distribution centers. As we near maximum utilization of a given facility or maximize our processing capacity, operations may be constrained and inefficiencies have been and may be created, which could adversely affect our results of operations unless the facility is expanded, volume is shifted to another facility or additional processing capacity is added. Conversely, as we add additional facilities or expand existing operations or facilities, excess capacity may be created. Any excess capacity may also create inefficiencies and adversely affect our results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand our existing distribution facilities or open new distribution facilities in new or existing markets as needed to accommodate or facilitate growth. Even if we are able to expand our distribution network, our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth, if any, will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational, financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand, train, motivate and manage our work force. We cannot assure you that our existing personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support the future growth of our operations. Our inability to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Increased fuel costs may adversely affect our results of operations. Increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations. The high cost of diesel fuel can increase the price we pay for products as well as the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers. These factors, in turn, may negatively impact our net sales, margins, operating expenses and operating results. To manage this risk, we have in the past periodically entered, and may in the future periodically enter, into heating oil derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our projected diesel fuel requirements. Heating crude oil prices have a highly correlated relationship to fuel prices, making these derivatives effective in offsetting changes in the cost of diesel fuel. We are not party to any commodity swap agreements and, as a result, our exposure to volatility in the price of diesel fuel has increased relative to our exposure to volatility in prior periods in which we had outstanding heating oil derivative contracts. We do not enter into fuel hedge contracts for speculative purposes. We have in the past, and may in the future, periodically enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected diesel fuel requirements. If fuel prices decrease significantly, these forward purchases may prove ineffective and result in us paying higher than the then market costs for a portion of our diesel fuel. As of July 30, 2011, there were no forward diesel fuel commitments in effect. We also maintain a fuel surcharge program which allows us to pass some of our higher fuel costs through to our customers. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to pass a comparable proportion or any of our higher fuel costs to our customers in the future, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Disruption of our distribution network could adversely affect our business. Damage or disruption to our distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes, the financial and/or operational instability of key suppliers, or other reasons could impair our ability to distribute our products. To the extent that we are unable, or it is not financially feasible, to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to manage effectively such events if they occur, there could be an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations. 20 Table of Contents The cost of the capital available to us and any limitations on our ability to access additional capital may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have a $400 million secured revolving credit facility, which matures on November 27, 2012, and under which borrowings accrue interest, at our option, at either (i) the base rate (the applicable prime lending rate of Bank of America Business Capital, as announced from time to time), or (ii) the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.75%. As of July 30, 2011, our borrowing base, based on accounts receivable and inventory levels and described more completely below under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Revenues", was $400.0 million, with remaining availability of $262.0 million. We have a term loan agreement in the principal amount of $75 million secured by certain real property. The term loan is repayable over seven years based on a fifteen-year amortization schedule. Interest on the term loan accrues at one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%. As of July 30, 2011, $47.1 million was outstanding under the term loan agreement. In order to maintain our profit margins, we rely on strategic investment buying initiatives, such as discounted bulk purchases, which require spending significant amounts of working capital up front to purchase products that we will sell over a multi-month time period. In the event that our cost of capital increases, such as during a period in which we are not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenants under our revolving credit facility and our term loan agreement, or our ability to borrow funds or raise equity capital is limited, we could suffer reduced profit margins and be unable to grow our business organically or through acquisitions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility. Our debt agreements contain financial covenants and other restrictions that limit our operating flexibility, limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences, including: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less leverage or better access to capital resources. In addition, each of our credit facility and term loan requires that we comply with various financial tests and imposes certain restrictions on us, including among other things, restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make loans or investments or pay dividends. Failure to comply with these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations. Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to: demand for our products; including as a result of seasonal fluctuations; changes in our operating expenses, including fuel and insurance expenses; management's ability to execute our business and growth strategies; 21 Table of Contents changes in customer preferences, including levels of enthusiasm for health, fitness and environmental issues; fluctuation of natural product prices due to competitive pressures; personnel changes; general economic conditions including inflation; supply shortages, including a lack of an adequate supply of high-quality agricultural products due to poor growing conditions, natural disasters or otherwise; volatility in prices of high-quality agricultural products resulting from poor growing conditions, natural disasters or otherwise; and future acquisitions, particularly in periods immediately following the consummation of such acquisition transactions while the operations of the acquired businesses are being integrated into our operations. Due to the foregoing factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. We are subject to significant governmental regulation. Our business is highly regulated at the federal, state and local levels and our products and distribution operations require various licenses, permits and approvals. In particular: the products that we distribute in the United States are subject to inspection by the United States Food and Drug Administration; our warehouse and distribution facilities are subject to inspection by the USDA and state health authorities; and the United States Department of Transportation and the United States Federal Highway Administration regulate our United States trucking operations. Our Canadian operations are similarly subject to extensive regulation, including the English and French dual labeling requirements applicable to products that we distribute in Canada. The loss or revocation of any existing licenses, permits or approvals or the failure to obtain any additional licenses, permits or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, as a distributor and manufacturer of natural, organic, and specialty foods, we are subject to increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety and the sale, packaging and marketing of natural and organic products. Compliance with these laws may impose a significant burden on our operations. If we were to manufacture or distribute foods that are or are perceived to be contaminated, any resulting product recalls, such as the peanut-related recall in January 2009 and egg recall in August 2010, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant United States and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Increased regulation regarding greenhouse gas emissions, especially diesel engine emissions, could impose substantial costs on us. These costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our vehicles prematurely. Until the timing, scope and extent of such regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on our results of operations. It is reasonably possible, however, that it could impose material costs on us which we may be unable to pass on to our customers. 22 Table of Contents Product liability claims could have an adverse effect on our business. We face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the products we manufacture or sell cause injury or illness. We may be subject to liability, which could be substantial, because of actual or alleged contamination in products manufactured or sold by us, including products sold by companies before we acquired them. We have, and the companies we have acquired have had, liability insurance with respect to product liability claims. This insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or at all, and may not be adequate to cover product liability claims against us or against companies we have acquired. We generally seek contractual indemnification from manufacturers, but any such indemnification is limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party. If we or any of our acquired companies do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, product liability claims and costs associated with product recalls, including a loss of business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are dependent on a number of key executives. Management of our business is substantially dependent upon the services of certain key management employees. Loss of the services of any officers or any other key management employee could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Union-organizing activities could cause labor relations difficulties. As of July 30, 2011 we had approximately 6,900 full and part-time employees, 390 of whom (approximately 5.9%) are covered by collective bargaining agreements at our Edison, New Jersey, Auburn, Washington, Leicester, Massachusetts, and Iowa City, Iowa facilities. The Edison, New Jersey, Auburn, Washington, Leicester, Massachusetts and Iowa City, Iowa agreements expire in June 2014, February 2012, March 2013 and June 2014, respectively. We have in the past been the focus of union-organizing efforts. On June 8, 2010, the National Labor Relations Board issued a certification of representative notice to us with respect to our Dayville, Connecticut drivers, resulting from an election there in May 2010. Subsequently, we entered into negotiations with Teamsters' representatives to reach a collective bargaining agreement. On June 14, 2011, with no collective bargaining agreement having been reached, the Dayville facility drivers petitioned for decertification of union representation. A decertification election took place on July 14 - 15, 2011, and the petition failed to achieve decertification by one vote. We reached agreement on a collective bargaining agreement for these workers on August 1, 2011. In September of 2010, we received a petition for union representation of our Iowa City, Iowa distribution center's drivers and dispatchers by the Teamsters. An election was held in October of 2010, which was favorable to management, the results of which were certified in October 2010. On October 18, 2010, the National Labor Relations Board issued a petition for union representation of the warehouse associates at our Greenwood, Indiana distribution center by the Teamsters. An election was held in November 2010, and the National Labor Relations Board issued its certification of results of election in favor of management on December 1, 2010. As we increase our employee base and broaden our distribution operations to new geographic markets, our increased visibility could result in increased or expanded union-organizing efforts. Although we have not experienced a work stoppage to date, if additional employees were to unionize or we are not successful in reaching agreement with these employees, we could be subject to work stoppages and increases in labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 23 Table of Contents The market price for our common stock may be volatile. In recent periods, there has been significant volatility in the market price of our common stock. In addition, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to a number of factors, including the following: our quarterly operating results or the operating results of other distributors of organic or natural food and non-food products and of supernatural chains and conventional supermarkets and other of our customers; changes in general conditions in the economy, the financial markets or the organic or natural food and non-food product distribution industries; changes in financial estimates or recommendations by stock market analysts regarding us or our competitors; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions; increases in labor, energy, fuel costs or the costs of food products; natural disasters, severe weather conditions or other developments affecting us or our competitors; publication of research reports about us or the organic or natural food and non-food product distribution industries generally; changes in market valuations of similar companies; additions or departures of key management personnel; actions by institutional stockholders; and speculation in the press or investment community. In addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.
