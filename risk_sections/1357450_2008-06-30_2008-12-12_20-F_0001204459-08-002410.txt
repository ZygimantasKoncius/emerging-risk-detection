Risk Factors An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this annual report, before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS We will need to commit greater resources to new product and service development in order to stay competitive, and we may fail to offset the increased cost of such development with a sufficient increase in net sales or margins. The success of our business depends in great measure on our ability to keep pace with, or even lead, changes that occur in our industry. Traditionally, the automation and control systems business was relatively stable and slow moving. Successive generations of products offered only marginal improvements in terms of functionality and reliability. However, the emergence of computers, computer networks and electronic components as key elements of the systems that we design and build has accelerated the pace of change in our industry. Where there was formerly as much as a decade or even more between successive generations of automation systems, the time between generations is now as little as two to three years. Technological advances and the introduction of new products, new designs and new manufacturing techniques by our competitors could adversely affect our bus iness unless we are able to respond with similar advances. To remain competitive, we must continue to incur significant costs in product development, equipment and facilities and to make capital investments. These costs may increase, resulting in greater fixed costs and operating expenses than we have incurred to date. As a result, we could be required to expend substantial funds for and commit significant resources to the following: 7 • Research and development activities on existing and potential product solutions; • Additional engineering and other technical personnel; • Advanced design, production and test equipment; • Manufacturing services that meet changing customer needs; • Technological changes in manufacturing processes; and • Expansion of manufacturing capacity. Our future operating results will depend to a significant extent on our ability to continue providing new product solutions that compare favorably on the basis of time to market, cost and performance, with competing third-party suppliers and technologies. Our failure to increase net sales sufficiently to offset the increased costs needed to achieve those advances would adversely affect our operating results. We may experience trade barriers in expanding to our targeted emerging markets and may be subject to tariffs and taxes that will result in significant additional costs for our business and products. We may experience barriers to conducting business and trade in our planned expansion to emerging markets. These barriers may be in the form of delayed customs clearances, customs duties or tariffs. In addition, we may be subject to repatriation taxes levied upon the exchange of income from local currency into foreign currency, substantial taxes of profits, revenues, assets and payroll, as well as value-added tax. The markets into which we may expand may impose onerous and unpredictable duties, tariffs and taxes on our business and products. These barriers or expenses could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results. We do not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers, so our customers are free to choose products from our competitors, which would result in a loss of revenue and profitability. We are engaged in the design, production and installation of automation and process control systems. As a result, our revenues result from numerous individual contracts that, once completed, typically produce only a limited amount of ongoing revenues for maintenance and other services. Furthermore, customers may change or delay or terminate orders for products without notice for any number of reasons unrelated to us, including lack of market acceptance for the products to be produced by the process our system was designed to control. As a result, in order to maintain and expand our business, we must be able to replenish the orders in its pipeline on a continuous basis. It is possible that some of our potential customers could choose the products of our competitors. Should they do so, we would suffer a decline in revenues and profitability. The success of our business depends heavily on securing a steady stream of new customers. Our average contract is worth approximately $100,000. While some of those contracts are for upgrades and additions to existing control systems, most of them are for new installations. In order for our business to continue to succeed and grow, we need to secure contracts with new customers on a regular basis. We may not be successful in securing new contracts. A lack of adequate engineering resources could cause our business to lose profitability and potential business prospects. One of the competitive advantages that we enjoy is the relatively low cost of our engineering staff compared to those of our Western and Japan-based competitors. The plentiful supply of affordable engineering talent in China is a key element of our overall business strategy. However, if the available supply of engineers were to be absorbed by competing demands, then the cost of hiring, training and retaining capable engineers would likely increase. This could result in a reduction in our profitability and business prospects, or could even cause a change in our business strategy. 8 Our products may contain design or manufacturing defects, which could result in reduced demand for our products or services, customer claims and uninsured liabilities. We manufacture spare parts for maintenance and replacement purposes after completion of integrated solution contracts to our customers requirements, which can be highly complex and may at times contain design or manufacturing errors or defects. Any defects in the spare parts we manufacture may result in returns, claims, delayed shipments to customers or reduced or cancelled customer orders. If these defects occur, we will incur additional costs, and if they occur in large quantity or frequently, we may sustain additional costs, loss of business reputation and legal liability. Moreover, we are in the process of entering both the nuclear power generation and railway control systems sectors. Each of these sectors poses a substantially higher risk of liability in the event of a system failure, than was present in the industrial process controls markets in whi ch we traditionally compete. We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage to protect us against these and other risks associated with our business. The typical practice of the industries with which we are involved is for the customers to obtain insurance to protect their own operational risks. Therefore, we currently do not carry any insurance coverage to protect against the risks related to product failure. However, it is possible that such customers or their insurers could assert claims against us for any damages caused by a failure in one of our systems, and as a result, the failure of any of our products could result in a liability that would seriously impair our financial condition or even force us out of business. Our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position, and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights may be costly. Our business is based on a number of proprietary products and systems, some of which are patented, others of which we protect as trade secrets. We strive to strengthen and differentiate our product portfolio by developing new and innovative products and product improvements. As a result, we believe that the protection of our intellectual property will become increasingly important to our business as the functionality of automation systems increases to meet customer demand and as we try to open new markets for our products. Implementation and enforcement of intellectual property-related laws in China has historically been lacking due primarily to ambiguities in PRC intellectual property law. Accordingly, protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights in China may not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. Currently, we hold 18 PRC utility pa tents that relate to various product configurations and product components and have 20 pending PRC patent applications. We will continue to rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights to provide protection in this regard, but this protection may be inadequate. For example, our pending or future patent applications may not be approved or, if allowed, they may not be of sufficient strength or scope. As a result, third parties may use the technologies and proprietary processes that we have developed and compete with us, which could negatively affect any competitive advantage we enjoy, dilute our brand and harm our operating results. In addition, policing the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and given the relative unpredictability of Chinas legal system and potential difficulties enforcing a court judgment in China, there is no guarantee litigation would result in an outcome favorable to us. Furthermore, any such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention away from our core business. An adverse determination in any lawsuit involving our intellectual property is likely to jeopardize our business prospects and reputation. We have no insurance coverage against litigation costs so we would be forced to bear all litigation costs if we cannot recover them from other parties. All of the foregoing factors could harm our business and financial condition. 9 We may develop new products that do not gain market acceptance, which would result in the failure to recover the significant costs for design and manufacturing services for new product solutions, thus adversely affecting operating results. We operate in an industry characterized by increasingly frequent and rapid technological advances, product introductions and new design and manufacturing improvements. As a result, we must expend funds and commit resources to research and development activities, possibly requiring additional engineering and other technical personnel; purchasing new design, production, and test equipment; and enhancing our design and manufacturing processes and techniques. We may invest in equipment employing new production techniques for existing products and new equipment in support of new technologies that fail to generate adequate returns on the investment due to insufficient productivity, functionality or market acceptance of the products for which the equipment may be used. We could, therefore, incur significant costs for design and manufacturing services for new product solutions tha t do not generate a sufficient return on that investment, which would adversely affect our future operating results. Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to provide timely design and manufacturing services for new products that compete favorably with design and manufacturing capabilities of third party suppliers. RISKS RELATING TO THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE Our plans for growth rely on an increasing emphasis on railroad and nuclear power sectors, and these sectors present fewer business opportunities, so we may not be successful in growing these new markets. While the principal focus of our business until recently has been to provide Distributed Control Systems, or DCS to industrial and manufacturing companies, our plans for growth include an increasing emphasis on railroad control systems and nuclear power generation control systems. These sectors generally present fewer business opportunities during a given period relative to the industrial and manufacturing sectors. However, the average size of contracts in those sectors tends to be much larger, and as a result, the competition for such contracts is substantial. We may not be successful in entering these new markets and, if it were unable to do so, our revenues and profits would decline, resulting in a decreased value of our stock. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, allowing them to be able to reduce their prices, which would force us to reduce our prices. We operate in a very competitive environment with many major international and domestic companies, such as Honeywell, General Electric, ABB, Siemens, Emerson and Hitachi. Many of our competitors are much better established and more experienced than we are, have substantially greater financial resources, operate in many international markets and are much more diversified than we are. As a result, they are in a strong position to compete effectively with us by, for example, reducing their prices, which could force us to reduce our prices. These large competitors are also in a better position than we are to weather any extended weaknesses in the market for automation and control systems. Other emerging companies or companies in related industries may also increase their participation in our market, which would add to the competitive pressures that we face. A decrease in the rate of growth in Chinese industry and the Chinese economy in general may lead to a decrease in our revenues because industrial companies in China are the principal current source of revenues for us. Industrial companies operating in China are the principal current source of revenues for us. Our business has benefited in the past from the rapid expansion of Chinas industrial activity, which has created additional demand from existing companies and led to the formation of numerous additional companies that have need for our products and services. Chinas industrial expansion has been fueled in large measure by international demand for the low-cost goods that China is able to produce due to labor advantages and other comparative advantages, such as governmental subsidies to offset research and development expenses and taxes and reduced land use/facilities costs for targeted industries. The Chinese economy may not be able to sustain this rate of growth in the future, and any reduction in the rate of Chinas industrial growth or a shrinking of China 146;s industrial base could adversely affect our revenues. The resulting increase in competition for customers might also cause erosion of profit margins that we have been able to achieve historically. 10 Our plans to enter the international automation market may not prove successful, and we may waste capital resources and needlessly divert managements time and attention from our principal market. To date we have conducted nearly all of our business within China. However, we have plans to enter international markets in the near future. While the manner in which we plan to do so will likely not involve large expenditures of capital and resources, it will also require meaningful amounts of management time and attention. Our products and our overall approach to the automation and controls system business may not be accepted in other markets to the extent needed to make that effort profitable. In addition, the additional demands on our management from these activities may detract from our efforts in the domestic Chinese market, causing the operating results in our principal market to be adversely affected. We depend heavily on key personnel, and loss of key employees and senior management could harm our business. Our future business and results of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our key technical and senior management personnel, including Dr. Changli Wang, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Ms. Herriet Qu, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. They also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management, technical, marketing and sales and support personnel for our operations. If we lose a key employee, if a key employee fails to perform in his or her current position or if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees as needed, our business could suffer. Turnover in our senior management could significantly deplete institutional knowledge held by our existing senior management team and impair our operations. In addition, if any of these key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose some of our customers. We have entered into confidentiality and non-competition agreements with all of these key personnel. However, if any disputes arise between these key personnel and us, it is not clear, in light of uncertainties associated with the PRC legal system, what the court decisions will be and the extent to which these court decisions could be enforced in China, where all of these key personnel reside and hold some of their assets. See Risks Related to Doing Business in ChinaUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us. We may be exposed to potential risks relating to our internal controls over financial reporting and our ability to have those controls attested to by our independent auditors. As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX 404, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the companys internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports, including Form 20-F. In addition, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a companys financial statements must also attest to and report on the effectiveness of the companys internal controls over financial reporting. Under current law, we will be required to include a management report beginning with our annual report for the 2009 fiscal year and to include our independent registered public accounting firms attestation report beginning with our annual report for the 2009 fiscal year if we are deemed to be an accelerated filer or for the 2010 fiscal year if we continue to be deemed as a smaller reporting company. Our management may conclude that our internal controls over our financial reporting are not effective. Even if our management concludes that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. We can provide no assurance that we will be in compliance with all of the requirements imposed by SOX 404 or that we will receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors. In the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner or we are unable to receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors with respect to our internal controls, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. 11 RISKS RELATED TO DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA Changes in Chinas political or economic situation could harm us and our operational results. The PRC government has been reforming its economic system since the late 1970s. The economy of the PRC has historically been a nationalistic, planned economy, meaning it has functioned and produced according to governmental plans and pre-set targets or quotas. However, in recent years, the PRC government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform and the reduction of state ownership in business enterprises, which have had a positive effect on the economic development of the country and have greatly benefited our business. However, the government could change these economic reforms or any of the legal systems at any time and a change could either benefit or damage our operations and profitability. Some of the things that could have this effect are: • Level of government involvement in the economy; • Control of foreign exchange; • Methods of allocating resources; • Balance of payments position; • International trade restrictions; and • International conflict. A recent positive economic change has been the PRCs entry into the World Trade Organization, the global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations. Many observers believe that the PRCs entry will ultimately result in a reduction of tariffs for industrial products, a reduction in trade restrictions and an increase in international trade with China. However, the PRC has not yet fully complied with all of obligations that it must meet prior to being admitted as a full member of the WTO, including fully opening its markets to goods from other countries, currency exchange requirements and other measures designed to ease the current trade imbalance that China has with many of its trading partners. If the scheduled actions to rectify these problems are not completed, trade relations between China and some of its trading partners may be strained. While the majority of our business currently is conducted solely within China, this may have a negative impact on Chinas economy generally, which would adversely affect its business. It could also reduce or eliminate any benefits that we hope to achieve by expanding our business internationally. In addition, the Chinese economy differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, in many ways. As a result of these differences, we may not develop in the same way or at the same rate as might be expected if the Chinese economy were similar to those of the OECD member countries. The discontinuation of or changes to the preferential tax treatment and subsidies currently available to our PRC subsidiaries may result in increased tax liabilities which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Foreign invested enterprises, or FIEs, established in the PRC were generally subject to an enterprise income tax, or EIT, rate of 33.0%, which includes a 30.0% state income tax and a 3.0% local income tax. FIEs established in Coastal Open Economic Zones, Special Economic Zones or Economic and Technical Development Zones, such as our PRC subsidiaries, were subject to an EIT rate of 27.0%, comprised of a 24.0% state income tax and a 3.0% local income tax. Under the income tax law and the related implementing rules, FIEs engaging in manufacturing businesses with a term of operation exceeding ten years may, subject to approval from local taxation authorities, be entitled to a two-year tax exemption from PRC EIT starting from the year they become profitable and a 50.0% tax reduction for the three years thereafter. Beijing HollySys is registered in a high-tech zone located in Be ijing and has been deemed as a high-tech enterprise by the Beijing Commission of Science and Technology. As a result, it was entitled to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15%, so long as it continued to operate in the high-tech zone and maintained its high or new technology enterprise status. Hangzhou HollySys is registered as a FIE and was subject to the EIT at a preferential rate of 26.4% of assessable profits, consisting of a 24.0% national tax and a 2.4% local tax (reduced from the usual 3%). Hangzhou HollySys was also entitled to receive a 100% exemption from income tax for 2004 and 2005 and a 50% exemption from income tax for three years beginning January 1, 2006 until December 31, 2008. 12 On March 16, 2007, the National Peoples Congress passed the new Enterprise Income Tax law (the new EIT law) which imposes a single income tax rate of 25% for most domestic enterprises and foreign investment enterprise. The new EIT law was effective as of January 1, 2008. The new EIT law provides a five-year transition period from its effective date for those enterprises which were established before March 16, 2007 and which were entitled to a preferential lower tax rate under the then effective tax laws or regulations, as well as grandfathering tax holidays. Further, according to the new EIT law, entities that qualify as High-tech Enterprises are entitled to the preferential EIT rate of 15%. According to the preferential regulations specified by State Council, Beijing HollySys had entitled to be subject to a favorable income tax rate at 15% from October 1, 2002 to December 31, 2007. As of June 30, 2008, Beijing HollySys has not yet applied for the status as a High-tech Enterprises as the new recognition criteria and procedures for High-tech Enterprise under the new EIT law were newly issued on April 14, 2008. Beijing HollySys is in the process of applying for the High-tech Enterprise status, and the management expects Beijing HollySys to be continued as High-tech Enterprise under the new EIT law and entitled to the preferential tax rate of 15% for the calendar year ending December 31, 2008. However, if Beijing HollySys cannot successfully obtain the approval as High-tech Enterprise, the applicable tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2008 will be i ncreased to 25%. Hangzhou HollySys is registered as foreign investment enterprise conducting production function. In accordance with income tax law for enterprise with foreign investments in China, Hangzhou HollySys has entitled to receive a 100% exemption of income tax for two years and a 50% exemption of income tax for the next three years on a continuing basis since the first year Hangzhou HollySys has generated a taxable income. Prior to December 23, 2006, Hangzhou HollySys was in the status of enjoying a 50% exemption under a 26.4% income tax rate for the first year. On December 23, 2006, Hangzhou HollySys received a notice from Hangzhou City tax authority, which indicates that the income tax rate applicable to Hangzhou HollySys should be adjusted to 16.5% effective January 1, 2006 in accordance with relevant regulations regarding the development zones as Hangzhou Ho llySys is located in a development zones recognized by the Ministry of Land and Resource in China. For the calendar year ending December 31, 2008, the relevant rate would be gradually adjusted to 18% under the new EIT law. As a result under the new Tax Law, Hangzhou HollySys tax rate is 9% in its last year of tax holiday with 50% reduction. Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us. We conduct substantially all of our business through our operating subsidiaries in China. Our operating subsidiaries are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to foreign-invested enterprises. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions may be cited for reference, but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, a series of new PRC laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to you and us. In additi on, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, all of our executive officers and all but one of our directors are residents of China and not of the United States, and substantially all the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it could be difficult for investors to effect service of process in the United States or to enforce a judgment obtained in the United States against our Chinese officers, directors and subsidiaries. 13 The PRC government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities. The PRC government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures. Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our sales revenue effectively. Most of our sales revenue and expenses are denominated in Renminbi. Under PRC law, the Renminbi is currently convertible under the current account, which includes dividends and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the capital account, which includes foreign direct investment and loans. Currently, our PRC operating subsidiaries may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions, including payments of dividends to us, without the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, the relevant PRC government authorities may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future. Since a significant amount of our future revenue will be denominated in Renminbi, any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in Renminbi to fund our business activities outside China that are denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange transactions by PRC operating subsidiaries under the capital account continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of or need to register with PRC government authorities, including SAFE. In particular, if our PRC operating subsidiaries borrow foreign currency through loans from us or other foreign lenders, these loans must be registered with SAFE, and if we finance the subsidiaries by means of additional capital contributions, these capital contributions must be approved by certain government authorities, including the Ministry of Commerce, or their respective local counterparts. These limitations could affect our PRC operating subsidiaries ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing. Failure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident stockholders to personal liability, limit our ability to acquire PRC companies or to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially adversely affect us. In October 2005, SAFE issued a public notice, the Notice on Relevant Issues in the Foreign Exchange Control over Financing and Return Investment Through Special Purpose Companies by Residents Inside China, or the SAFE Notice, which requires PRC residents to register with the competent local SAFE branch before using onshore assets or equity interests held by them to establish offshore special purpose companies, or SPVs, for the purpose of overseas equity financing. Under the SAFE Notice, such PRC residents must also file amendments to their registration in connection with any increase or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, mergers and acquisitions, equity investment or creation of any security interest in any assets located in China to guarantee offshore obligations. Moreover, if the SPVs were established and owned the onshore assets or equity i nterests before the implementation date of the SAFE Notice, a retroactive SAFE registration is required to have been completed before March 31, 2006. If any PRC resident stockholder of any SPV fails to make the required SAFE registration and amended registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that SPV may be prohibited from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the SPV. Failure to comply with the SAFE registration and amendment requirements described above could also result in liability under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. 14 We believe our stockholders who are PRC residents as defined in the SAFE Notice have registered with the relevant branch of SAFE, as currently required, in connection with their equity interests in us and our acquisitions of equity interests in our PRC subsidiaries. However, we cannot provide any assurances that their existing registrations have fully complied with, and they have made all necessary amendments to their registration to fully comply with, all applicable registrations or approvals required by the SAFE Notice. Moreover, because of uncertainty over how the SAFE Notice will be interpreted and implemented, and how or whether SAFE will apply it to us, we cannot predict how it will affect our business operations or future strategies. For example, our present and prospective PRC subsidiaries ability to conduct foreign exchange activitie s, such as the remittance of dividends and foreign currency- denominated borrowings, may be subject to compliance with the SAFE Notice by our PRC resident beneficial holders. In addition, such PRC residents may not always be able to complete the necessary registration procedures required by the SAFE Notice. We also have little control over either our present or prospective direct or indirect stockholders or the outcome of such registration procedures. A failure by our PRC resident beneficial holders or future PRC resident stockholders to comply with the SAFE Notice, if SAFE requires it, could subject these PRC resident beneficial holders to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our subsidiaries ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects. We may be unable to complete a business combination transaction efficiently or on favorable terms due to complicated merger and acquisition regulations which became effective on September 8, 2006. The recent PRC Regulation on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the PRC Merger Law, also governs the approval process by which a PRC company may participate in an acquisition of assets or equity interests. Depending on the structure of the transaction, the new regulation will require the PRC parties to make a series of applications and supplemental applications to the government agencies. In some instances, the application process may require the presentation of economic data concerning a transaction, including appraisals of the target business and evaluations of the acquirer, which are designed to allow the government to assess the transaction. Government approvals will have expiration dates by which a transaction must be completed and reported to the government agencies. Com pliance with the new regulations is likely to be more time consuming and expensive than in the past and the government can now exert more control over the combination of two businesses. We intend to grow our operations through acquisitions and business combinations with other companies, including companies in China, and such acquisitions and business combinations may be subject to the regulations and governmental approvals described above. However, due to the new regulation, our ability to engage in business combination transactions has become significantly more complicated, time consuming and expensive, and we may not be able to negotiate a transaction that is acceptable to our stockholders or sufficiently protect their interests in a transaction. The PRC Merger Law allows PRC government agencies to assess the economic terms of a business combination transaction. Parties to a business combination transaction may have to submit to the Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, and other relevant government agencies an appraisal report, an evaluation report and the acquisition agreement, all of which form part of the application for approval, depending on the structure of the transaction. The regulations also prohibit a transaction at an acquisition price obviously lower than the appraised value of the PRC business or assets and in certain transaction structures, require that consideration must be paid within defined periods, generally not in excess of a year. The regulation also limits our ability to negotiate various terms of the acquisition, including aspects of th e initial consideration, contingent consideration, holdback provisions, indemnification provisions and provisions relating to the assumption and allocation of assets and liabilities. Transaction structures involving trusts, nominees and similar entities are prohibited. Therefore, such regulation may impede our ability to negotiate and complete a business combination transaction on financial terms that satisfy our investors and protect our stockholders economic interests. 15 Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities. The value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and the Renminbi and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Because substantially all of our earnings and cash assets are denominated in Renminbi and the net proceeds from this offering will be denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Renminbi will affect the relative purchasing power of these proceeds, our balance sheet and our earnings per share in U.S. dollars following this offering. In addition, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars and earnings from, and the value of, any U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the future. Since July 2005, the Renminbi has no longer been pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the Peoples Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the Renminbi may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future the PRC may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the Renminbi exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market. Very limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert Renminbi into foreign currencies. We may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal and financial controls in the PRC, which could result in misconduct and difficulty in complying with applicable laws and requirements. As a privately held company in the PRC, we have not historically focused on establishing Western style management and financial reporting concepts and practices, in areas such as in modern banking, computer and other internal control systems. We may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified internal control employees to work in the PRC. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet Western standards. RISKS RELATED TO OUR SHARES The market price of our common stock is volatile, leading to the possibility of its value being depressed at a time when you want to sell your holdings. The market price of our common stock is volatile, and this volatility may continue. Numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. These factors may include:  our earnings releases, actual or anticipated changes in our earnings, fluctuations in our operating results or our failure to meet the expectations of financial market analysts and investors;  changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock; 16  speculation about our business in the press or the investment community;  significant developments relating to our relationships with our customers or suppliers;  stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those that are in our industry;  customer demand for our products;  investor perceptions of our industry in general and our company in particular;  the operating and stock performance of comparable companies;  general economic conditions and trends;  major catastrophic events;  announcements by us or our competitors of new products, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;  changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretation or principles;  loss of external funding sources;  sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors, officers or significant stockholders; and  additions or departures of key personnel. Securities class action litigation is often instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our managements attention and resources. Moreover, securities markets may from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations for reasons unrelated to operating performance of particular companies. For example, in the year 2008, the securities markets in the United States, China and other jurisdictions experienced the largest decline in share prices since September 2001. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock and other interests in our company at a time when you want to sell your interest in our Company. We are a British Virgin Islands company and, because the rights of shareholders under British Virgin Islands law differ from those under U.S. law, you may have fewer protections as a shareholder. Our corporate affairs are governed by our Memorandum and Articles of Association, the Business Companies Act of the British Virgin Islands and the common law of the British Virgin Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibility of the directors under British Virgin Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the British Virgin Islands. The common law of the British Virgin Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the British Virgin Islands, as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the British Virgin Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under British Virgin Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be und er statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the British Virgin Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and some states (such as Delaware) have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. British Virgin Islands companies may not be able to initiate shareholder derivative actions, thereby depriving shareholders of the ability to protect their interests. British Virgin Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the United States. The circumstances in which any such action may be brought, and the procedures and defenses that may be available in respect to any such action, may result in the rights of shareholders of a British Virgin Islands company being more limited than those of shareholders of a company organized in the United States. Accordingly, shareholders may have fewer alternatives available to them if they believe that corporate wrongdoing has occurred. The British Virgin Islands courts are also unlikely to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts in the United States based on certain liability provisions of U.S. securities law; and to impose liabilities against us, in original actions brought in the British Virgin Islands, based on cert ain liability provisions of U.S. securities laws that are penal in nature. There is no statutory recognition in the British Virgin Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, although the courts of the British Virgin Islands will generally recognize and enforce the non-penal judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits. This means that even if shareholders were to sue us successfully, they may not be able to recover anything to make up for the losses suffered. 17 The laws of the British Virgin Islands provide little protection for minority stockholders, so minority stockholders will have little or no recourse if the stockholders are dissatisfied with the conduct of our affairs. Under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, there is little statutory law for the protection of minority shareholders. The principal protection under statutory law is that shareholders may bring an action to enforce the constituent documents of the corporation, the Articles and the Memorandum of Association. Shareholders are entitled to have the affairs of the company conducted in accordance with the general law and the articles and memorandum. The company is obliged to hold an annual general meeting and provide for the election of directors. Companies are obligated to appoint an independent auditor and shareholders are entitled to receive the audited financial statements of the company. There are common law rights for the protection of shareholders that may be invoked, largely dependent on English company law, since the common law of the British Virgin Islands for business companies is limited. Under the general rule pursuant to English company law known as the rule in Foss v. Throttle, a court will generally refuse to interfere with the management of a company at the insistence of a minority of its shareholders who express dissatisfaction with the conduct of the companys affairs by the majority or the board of directors. However, every shareholder is entitled to have the affairs of the company conducted properly according to law and the constituent documents of the corporation. As such, if those who control the company have persistently disregarded the requirements of company law or the provisions of the companys memorandum of associat ion or articles, then the courts will grant relief. Generally, the areas in which the courts will intervene are the following: (i) an act complained of which is outside the scope of the authorized business or is illegal or not capable of ratification by the majority, (ii) acts that constitute fraud on the minority where the wrongdoers control the company, (iii) acts that infringe on the personal rights of the shareholders, such as the right to vote, and (iv) where the company has not complied with provisions requiring approval of a special or extraordinary majority of shareholders, which are more limited than the rights afforded minority stockholders under the laws of many states in the U.S. Being a foreign private issuer exempts us from certain Securities and Exchange Commission requirements that provide stockholders the protection of information that must be made available to stockholders of United States public companies. We are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As such, we are exempt from certain provisions applicable to United States public companies including: • The rules requiring the filing with the SEC of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K; • The sections of the Securities Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations with respect to a security registered under the Securities Exchange Act; • Provisions of Regulation FD aimed at preventing issuers from making selective disclosures of material information; and • The sections of the Securities Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and establishing insider liability for profits realized from any short swing trading transactions (i.e., a purchase and sale, or a sale and purchase, of the issuer's equity securities within less than six months). 18 Because of these exemptions, our stockholders will not be afforded the same protections or information generally available to investors holding shares in public companies organized in the United States. Our holding company structure may hinder the payment of dividends. HLS Systems International, Ltd. has no direct business operations, other than its ownership of our subsidiaries. While we have no current intention of paying dividends, should we decide in the future to do so, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries and other holdings and investments. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us due to restrictive covenants in loan agreements, restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions as discussed below. If future dividends are paid in Renminbi, fluctuations in the exchange rate for the conversion of Renminbi into U.S. dollars may reduce th e amount received by U.S. stockholders upon conversion of the dividend payment into U.S. dollars. PRC regulations currently permit the payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Our subsidiaries in China are also required to set aside a portion of their after tax profits according to PRC accounting standards and regulations to fund certain reserve funds. Currently, our subsidiaries in China are the only sources of sales revenue or investment holdings for the payment of dividends. If they do not accumulate sufficient profits under PRC accounting standards and regulations to first fund certain reserve funds as required by PRC accounting standards, we will be unable to pay any dividends. In addition, under the new EIT Law, effective as of January 2008, dividends from our PRC subsidiaries to us will be subject to a withholding tax of 5%. 19
