RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to Unimarc We are currently involved in various litigation proceedings. We are currently involved in various litigation proceedings, some of which have been pending for several years, which could result in unfavorable decisions or financial penalties against us. We believe that we will continue to be subject to future litigation proceedings, which may be resolved against us and, if so, could have material adverse consequences to our business. Our financial condition or results from operations could be adversely affected in a material way if certain of these material claims are resolved against us. See “Item 8. Financial Information — Legal Proceedings”. We have substantial outstanding liabilities, and we are in default on some of our debt obligations. Our net sales (1) increased to Ch$118,091 million or 4.96% in 2006, from Ch$112,509 million in 2005 and (2) decrease to Ch$126,343 million or 8.6% in 2004, from Ch$138,283 million in 2003. Additionally, as of December 31, 2006 (1) our total current assets were Ch$17,550 million, while our total current liabilities were Ch$47,049 million, and (2) our total assets were Ch$150.065 million, while our total liabilities were Ch$72,826 million. Due to our financial difficulties we have been unable to repay some of our debt, and we have restructured the payment terms of our most important current liabilities. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review” and “Item 13. Defaults, Late Dividends and Delinquencies”. As of December 31, 2006, our long-term debt totaled Ch$4,106 million, or U.S.$7.7 million, or 2.7% of our total consolidated assets, and principally consisted of five loans to us or to our affiliates from, Banco CorpBanca S.A., or CorpBanca, Banco Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, or Banco Kreditanstalt, Banco Do Brasil, Banco Supervielle and Banco Santander Santiago S.A. We have incurred payment defaults in connection with several long-term loans. See “Item 13. Defaults, Late Dividends and Delinquencies”. As of December 31, 2006, we also had guaranteed the payment of certain debt incurred by our affiliates. In 1994 and 1996, a syndicate of financial institutions for whom State Street Bank and Trust Co., or State Street, acted as agent made a U.S.$50.0 million unsecured loan and a U.S.$65.0 million unsecured loan, respectively, to Inverraz. The payment terms of the 1994 loan were as follows: (1) principal was payable in semi-annual installments of U.S.$5,555,555, in March and September of every calendar year, beginning on September 2, 1998 and ending on March 2, 2002; (2) interest was payable semi-annually at a rate of 9.45% per year; and (3) interest on any overdue principal and any overdue interest (to the extent permitted by applicable law) is payable at the rate of 10.45%. The payment terms of the 1996 loan were as follows: (1) principal was payable in semi-annual installments of U.S.$4,444,445 under the series A tranche of the loan, and semi-annual installments of U.S.$2,777,778 under the series B tranche of the loan, in March and September of every calendar year, beginning on March 8, 2000 and ending on March 8, 2004; (2) interest under the series A tranche was payable semi-annually at the rate of 9.45% per year, and interest under the series B tranche was payable semi-annually at the rate of 9.45% per year; and (3) interest on any overdue principal and any overdue interest (to the extent permitted by applicable law) is payable at the rate of 10.45% under the series A tranche and at the rate of 10.45% under the series B tranche. We were one of the guarantors under the 1994 loan. We were also one of the guarantors under the 1996 loan. As guarantors, we agreed to guarantee the repayment obligations of Inverraz under the applicable loan (including the payment of principal, interest, fees, costs and any other charges related to 4 the applicable credit agreement) in an amount equal to our pro rata share, as specified in such loan, in accordance with our “attributable liability”. In each loan, our “attributable liability” is adjusted from time to time based on the outstanding balance of such loan. However, if State Street is unable to collect the attributable liability of one or more guarantors, or if one or more guarantors become subject to bankruptcy or similar proceedings or become affected by one of the events specified in the applicable credit agreement, the attributable liability of the other guarantors is subject to being increased pro rata by the amount of the attributable liability of the affected guarantors in the specified limited circumstances set forth in the loan agreements. The aggregate amount of the attributable liabilities of all guarantors under each loan is equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of such loan, together with any unpaid scheduled and default interest, and any other amounts payable by Inverraz under such loan. In April 2001, following a default by Inverraz and the acceleration of the debt under the loans, State Street initiated legal proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Inverraz, the loan guarantors (including us) and certain other entities claimed to be “loan guarantors” (collectively, the “Chilean Defendants”) seeking repayment of the loan. Refer to the case of State Street Bank and Trust Co. v. Inversiones Errazuriz Ltd. et al., No. 01 Civ. 3201 (RLC) (the “State Street Litigation”). The Chilean Defendants did not answer the complaint filed in the State Street Litigation on a timely basis, and a default judgment was entered on December 4, 2001 against all the Chilean Defendants, “jointly and severally”, for the full amount of the outstanding principal under the unsecured loans, a liquidated amount of “$57,283,874.86, with accrued pre-judgment interest at $20,011.63 per day from and including November 1, 2001” and “$79,180,000.12, with accrued pre-judgment interest at the rate of $21,599.47 per day from and including November 1, 2001”, for the 1994 and 1996 loans, respectively. The Chilean Defendants sought to vacate the default judgment. During that legal process, we maintained that, pursuant to our capped attributable liability under the credit agreements, we were exposed to liability of $13,688,889 under the 1994 loan and $25,230,328 under the 1996 loan. However, the default judgment was upheld on appeal and became a final, binding U.S. judgment. The Chilean Supreme Court granted the exequatur sought by State Street and recognized the U.S. judgment as the equivalent of an enforceable Chilean judgment on May 14, 2007, as described in greater detail in “Item 8 – Financial Information – Legal Proceedings”. The Chilean Defendants intend to pursue all available defenses vigorously to enforcement of this judgment, but, in the event the Chilean courts reject these defenses, any and/or all of them, including us, could be held liable for the full amount awarded to State Street under the U.S. judgment, which, at present, exceeds $136 million, plus interest. We have incurred certain contingent liabilities with respect to related party indebtedness. We have guaranteed the repayment of certain debt of related parties, which exposes us to direct liability if our related party defaults under such debt. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions” and “Item 8. Financial Information — Legal Proceedings”. Our controlling shareholder holds a substantial majority of our capital and exercises significant influence over us and may have interests that differ from those of our other shareholders. Inverraz is our ultimate, indirect parent company through its 97.2% ownership of Alimentos Nacionales S.A., which in turn owns 57.16% of our shares of common stock. Accordingly, Inverraz is in a position to direct our management and to determine the result of substantially all matters to be decided by vote of the shareholders, including the election of our board of directors. Additionally, if the Bank of New York, in its capacity as depositary of the ADSs, or the Depositary, does not receive instructions from a holder of ADSs with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the ADSs during or prior to the date established for such purpose, such holder is deemed, and the Depositary deems it to have instructed 5 the Depositary to give a discretionary proxy with full power of substitution to the President of our board of directors, or to a person designated by the President of our board of directors, to vote such shares of common stock.
