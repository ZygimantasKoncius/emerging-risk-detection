D. Risk Factors”, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events which are reasonably likely to have a material effect upon our net sales or revenues, income from continuing operations, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause reported financial information to not necessarily be indicative of future operating results or financial condition. E. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Leases As of March 31, 2010, we leased 437,698 hectares, through approximately 2,128 land lease contracts with an average term of five years. Six of these contracts (covering 30,260 hectares, or approximately 7.6 % of the land leased by us) are entities controlled by our chairman and controlling shareholder under arms-length terms. In accordance with these land lease contracts, we pay the lessors a certain fixed number of tons of sugarcane per hectare as consideration for the use of the land, and a certain fixed productivity per ton of sugarcane in terms of TSR. The overall volume of TSR is obtained by multiplying the number of hectares leased by the committed tons of sugarcane per hectare by the TSR per ton of sugarcane. The price that we pay for each kilogram of TSR is set by CONSECANA. In fiscal year 2008, we paid an average of 16.9 tons of sugarcane per hectare, and an average of 122.8 kilograms of TSR per ton of sugarcane, at an average cost of US$0.2987 million per kilogram of TSR under our land lease contracts. In transition fiscal year 2009, we paid an average of 17.2 tons of sugarcane per hectare, and an average of 121.6 kilograms of TSR per ton of sugarcane, at an average cost of US$0.1461 million per kilogram of TSR under our land lease contracts. In fiscal year 2010, we paid an average of 17.52 tons of sugarcane per hectare, at an average cost of US$0.1751 per kilogram of TSR under our land lease contracts. Bank guarantees As of March 31, 2010, we have entered into bank guarantees relating to legal proceedings, debt, energy auctions and concession agreements, as follows: In million of US$ Sugar & Ethanol US$ 173.5 Fuel distribution 76.8 Sugar logistics 59.8 Total US$ 310.1 F. Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth the maturity schedule of our material contractual financial obligations at March 31, 2010: Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than 5 years (in millions of US$) Long-term debt obligations(1) US$ 3,316.8 US$ 471.1 US$ 884.7 US$ 992.3 US$ 968.7 Operating lease obligations(2) 1,908.3 73.8 132.0 131.9 760.6 Purchase obligations 5,621.5 687.9 1,112.5 763.8 3,057.3 Advances from customers 980.4 201.3 574.3 204.8 — Total US$ 11,017.0 US$ 1,434.1 US$ 2,703.5 US$ 2,092.8 US$ 4,786.6 _____________ (1) Less than 1 year amounts include accrued interest over the existing debt, long term installments do not include any interest. (2) Purchase obligations were valued at the amount of sugarcane committed by a TSR of 129.8 kg per ton, at a price of R$0.3492, per kg as defined by CONSECANA for March 2010. 83 Table of Contents Our long-term debt consists primarily of: · US$547.2 million of export pre-payment notes due from 2012 through 2014; · US$520.1 million refers to the financing of co-generation projects, as well as the financing of Jataí and Caarapó greenfields (sugar and ethanol mills); · US$455.8 million perpetual notes with call option for Cosan beginning on February 2011; · US$405.3 million senior notes due February 2017; · US$354.4 million senior notes due February 2014; · US$297.2 million PESA debt due between 2018 and 2020, payable against CTN credits; and · US$212.6 million export credit notes due during 2012. We believe we will be able to refinance our existing debt on favorable market conditions. However, if we experience unfavorable market conditions, we believe that we already have available cash to repay our debt obligations due in the next three fiscal years, and, after that period, we expect to repay our debt obligations as they become due with cash generated by our operations. Recently Issued Accounting Standards FASB Accounting Standards Codification In September 2009, the Accounting Standards Codification, or “ASC”, became the source of authoritative U.S. GAAP recognized by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or “FASB”, for nongovernmental entities, except for certain FASB Statements not yet incorporated into ASC. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative U.S. GAAP for registrants. The authoritative guidance mentioned in these consolidated financial statements includes the applicable ASC reference. Subsequent Events We adopted ASC 855, “Subsequent Events”, which established general accounting standards and disclosure for subsequent events, during the year ended March 31, 2010. Noncontrolling Interests Effective April 1, 2009, we adopted new accounting guidance ASC 810, “Consolidation”, which changed the accounting for and the reporting of an entity’s minority ownership. Such minority ownership, previously referred to as minority interest, is now referred to as noncontrolling interests. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the reclassification of amounts previously attributable to minority interest and classified in the mezzanine outside of shareholders’ equity, to a separate component of shareholders’ equity titled “Noncontrolling Interests” in the consolidated balance sheets and statement of changes in shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss). Additionally, net income and comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests are shown separately from consolidated net income and comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of operations and statements of changes in shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss). Prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation as required by ASC 810. 84 Table of Contents Other New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820): Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, which will require companies to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value hierarchies and information on purchases, sales, issuance and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements. The ASU is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2009. The new disclosures about purchases, sales, issuance and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements is effective for interim and annua l reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010. We expect that the adoption of ASU 2010-06 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, Amendments to Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R), included in ASC Subtopic 810-10, Consolidations — Overall. This guidance is intended to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities by requiring ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and addresses concerns regarding the timeliness and usefulness of information about an enterprise’s involvement in a variable interest entity. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009, with early application prohibited. We do not believe the adoption will have a material impact on our co nsolidated financial statements. G. Safe harbor See “Forward-Looking Statements”. Item 6.

For a discussion of the role of our audit committee, see “Item 6C. Summary of Significant Differences of Corporate Governance Practices—Audit Committee”. The members of our audit committee are Messrs. Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes (chairman), Mailson Ferreira da Nóbrega, and Helio França Filho. Compensation Committee We have a compensation committee that reviews and approves the compensation and benefits for our executive officers and other key executives, makes recommendations to the board regarding compensation matters and is responsible for awarding equity-based compensation to our executive officers and other employees under our employee equity incentive plan. The committee also has the discretion to interpret the terms of the plan, to amend the plan and take all other actions necessary to administer the plan in our best interests. The members of our compensation committee are Messrs. Pedro Isamu Mizutani (chairman), Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes and Marcelo de Souza Scarcela Portela. Risk Management Committee We have a risk management committee that is responsible for advising the board on risk management, by establishing exposure limits and hedging ratios on a periodic basis so as to achieve better operational and financial controls.

We currently have no employment agreements with our directors and executive officers providing for benefits upon the termination of employment. Our directors and executive officers who serve for both us and Cosan will receive compensation from both companies. C. Summary of Significant Differences of Corporate Governance Practices The NYSE Corporate Governance Rules provide that we are required to disclose any significant differences on our corporate governance practices from those required to be followed by U.S. companies under NYSE listing standards. We have summarized these significant differences below. We are permitted to follow practice in Bermuda in lieu of the provisions of the NYSE Corporate Governance Rules, except that we will be required to have a qualifying audit committee under Section 303A.06 of the Rules, or avail ourselves of an appropriate exemption. In addition, Section 303A.12(b) provides that our chief executive officer is obligated to promptly notify the NYSE in writing after any of our executive officers becomes aware of any material non-compliance with any applicable provisions of the NYSE Corporate Governance Rules. Majority of Independent Directors NYSE Rule 303A.01 provides that each U.S. company that is listed on the Exchange must have a majority of independent directors. Bermuda corporate law does not require that we have a majority of independent directors. Under our bye-laws, at least 40% of our directors are required to be independent directors; which requirement increases to 60% following the death or permanent incapacitation of Mr. Rubens Ometto Silveira Mello. Separate Meetings of Non-Management Directors NYSE Rule 303A.03 provides that the non-management directors of each U.S. company that is listed on the Exchange must meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions without management. We are not required to have such executive sessions for the non-management directors under Bermuda law. Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee NYSE Rule 303A.04 provides that each U.S. company that is listed on the Exchange must have a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors. We are not required to have such a committee under Bermuda law. We believe that, pursuant to our bye-laws, the role of a nominating committee is generally performed by our board of directors and that the role of the corporate governance committee is generally performed by either our board of directors or our senior management. Compensation Committee NYSE Rule 303A.05 provides that each U.S. company that is listed on the Exchange must have a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors. We are not required to have such a committee under Bermuda law. However, we formed such a committee with one independent director. 91 Table of Contents Audit Committee NYSE Rule 303A.06 and the requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the SEC provide that each listed company is required to have an audit committee consisting entirely of independent members that comply with the requirements of Rule 10A-3. In addition, the company must have an internal audit function and otherwise fulfill the other requirements of the NYSE rules and Rule 10A-3 of the SEC. While we are not required under Bermuda law to have an audit committee, we have formed a committee that will have the following responsibilities: · pre-approve services to be provided by our independent auditor; · review auditor independence issues and rotation policy; · supervise the appointment of our independent auditors; · discuss with management and auditors major audit, accounting and internal control issues; · review quarterly financial statements prior to their publication, including the related notes, management’s report and auditor’s opinion; · review our annual report and financial statements; · provide recommendations to the board on the audit committee’s policies and practices; · review recommendations given by our independent auditor and internal audits and management’s responses; · provide recommendations on the audit committee’s bye-laws; and · the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by the issuer regarding accounting, internal controls or auditing matters. Equity Compensation Plans NYSE Rule 303A.08 provides that shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all equity compensation plans and material revisions thereto, with certain limited exemptions as described in the rule. Under Bermuda law, shareholder pre-approval is not required for the adoption of equity compensation plans nor any material revision thereto.

Recurring Transactions with Shareholders Cosan leases agricultural land for planting sugarcane from certain of our and its shareholders and other related parties on market terms. As of March 31, 2010 we leased 394.312 hectares, through 2,128 land lease contracts with an average term of five years. Six of these contracts (covering 30,260 hectares, or 7.6% of the land leased by us) are entities controlled by our chairman and controlling shareholder under arms-length terms. These land lease agreements are on arms-length terms equivalent to those we enter into with third parties. Lease payments under these agreements are based on the price of 16.9 tons of sugarcane per hectare, calculated in accordance with certain regulations of CONSECANA. Through our indirect subsidiary Agrícola Ponte Alta S.A., we also acquired 28 ships for R$12,115,000 pursuant to a Ship Purchase Agreement, entered into on October 1, 2009. We had previously leased and used the ships to transport sugarcane to our plant in Jaú, in the district of Potunduva. Guarantees with Related Parties On November 17, 2008, Cosan issued promissory notes for an aggregate outstanding principal amount of R$1.1 billion (US$617.6 million as of March 31, 2010). The promissory notes are subject to interest consisting of the accumulated change in average daily rates of Interfinancial Deposits plus 3% annual rate, payable on November 12, 2009, together with the principal amount of promissory notes. The promissory notes are secured by: (1) a guarantee of Mr. Rubens Ometto Silveira Mello; and (2) chattel mortgage of shares of CCL (current name of Essobrás). As a result of Cosan’s participation in the PESA federal government financing program between 1998 and 2000, Amaralina mortgaged land to secure the restructuring of Cosan’s debt, and Agrícola Ponte Alta and Pedro Ometto S.A. mortgaged land to secure the restructuring of the debt of Da Barra.

For approximately seven months, Cosan and Palermo Agricola Ltda, a special purpose company wholly-owned by Aguassanta Participações S/A , or “Palermo”, have been in the planning and execution stages of a project involving a build-to-suit and lease arrangement whereby Palermo would construct, pursuant to Cosan specifications, the building that will house Cosan’s shared services center in Piracicaba, São Paulo State, or the “Shared Services Center”, which would thereafter be leased by Palermo to Cosan. On July 1, 2010, Cosan entered into the build-to-suit and lease agreement with Palermo based on previously agreed business terms that formalized this arrangement. Following the completion of construction of the Shared Services Center, Cosan will lease this building from Palermo for a period of ten years, with monthly rental payments of R$350,000 (US$196,500). 99 Table of Contents C. Interests of Experts and Counsel Not applicable. Item 8. Financial Information A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information See Item 18 for our audited consolidated financial statements. Legal Proceedings Tax Proceedings We are engaged in a number of legal proceedings with Brazilian tax authorities in the total amount of US$1,400 million for which we have recorded provisions in an aggregate amount of US$173,924 million at March 31, 2010. In addition, there are currently certain legal proceedings pending in which we are involved for which we have not recorded provisions. If any of these legal proceedings is decided adversely against us, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Cosan has tax credits related to IPI Premium Credit introduced by Decree Law No. 491/69, which represents an incentive to export trading companies, through the grant of IPI tax credits calculated on export sales, as a form of compensation for the tax paid internally. We have used a portion of these credits to offset federal taxes and contributions. The Superior Court of Justice of Brazil had previously ruled that IPI premium credits could be used by companies to offset against other federal taxes. However, in a ruling dated November 9, 2005, the Superior Court of Justice of Brazil, a Brazilian appellate court, changed its prior position. This decision may be appealed by the losing party with the Superior Court of Justice of Brazil, and, if the party loses this appeal, it may further appeal the decision with the Superio r Federal Court of Brazil (Supremo Tribunal Federal). We have established a provision in the amount of US$116.3 million in our consolidated financial statements at April 30, 2008 for the full amount of the taxes that we have offset pursuant to the initial judicial authorization. Cosan opted to settle tax related claims in installments as provided by Brazilian Law No 11.941/09 and in MP 470/09. The Company and its subsidiaries used accumulated tax losses to pay the related fines and interest. Consequently there was a full reduction of the claims related to IPI tax credit, as well as the installment payment of other federal taxes, that were recorded as taxes payable. Da Barra is a party to legal actions challenging the right to recognize the IPI tax credits arising from purchases of raw materials, intermediary products and packaging materials that are tax-exempt, non-taxable or taxed at a zero percent rate. We have offset US$11.8 million of taxes with IPI tax credits as of March 31, 2009, and we have established a provision in the amount of US$24.6 million in our consolidated financial statements for the full amount of the taxes that we have offset pursuant to a judicial authorization granted (including interest calculated at the SELIC rate) as of March 31, 2009. These claims were all included in the tax amnesty program. On October 31, 2006, Cosan and controlled company Da Barra adhered to the Special Program for the Payment of ICMS Tax Debts. As a result, we settled a material portion of our ICMS tax debts and reduced considerably the amount of the corresponding provision. As for the remaining ICMS debts, we had established a provision in an aggregate amount of US$20.0 million as of March 31, 2009 and an aggregate provision of US$36,968 as of March 31, 2010. As of March 31, 2010, the total amount related to the remaining ICMS tax debts was US$336 million. In addition, the Brazilian federal tax authorities issued tax deficiency notices against Cosan and its subsidiaries alleging that it had not collected an aggregate amount of US$62.6 million in PIS and COFINS with respect to foreign exchange gains and other income. Due to a change in the tax legislation in May 2009, the Company evaluated its ongoing judicial claims related to the increase in the calculation basis of PIS and COFINS and reversed the related provision in the amount of US$30.2 million. 100 Table of Contents Da Barra instituted administrative proceedings to recover IPI taxes paid with respect to refined amorphous sugar and the right to offset these IPI taxes against other federal taxes. During these proceedings, Da Barra offset these IPI tax credits against other federal taxes. However, despite the ongoing administrative proceeding, the Brazilian federal tax authority (Receita Federal do Brasil), or “RFB”, issued tax deficiency notices against Da Barra, claiming that Da Barra owed the full amount of the federal taxes that it offset with these IPI tax credits. To suspend the effectiveness of these tax deficiency notices, Da Barra filed suit for and obtained a preliminary injunction through a writ of mandamus. As of March 31, 2010, Da Barra has used a porti on of these IPI tax credits to offset IPI and other federal taxes in an aggregate amount of US$148.0 million. We have not recorded a provision. Da Barra is a party to legal proceedings challenging the constitutionality of contributions that it did not pay to the Sugar and Alcohol Institute (Instituto do Açúcar e Álcool), or “IAA”, which were levied on the sale of sugar and ethanol during the period between March 1989 and November 1991, in an aggregate amount equal to US$18.3 million. In addition, Da Barra is a party to several tax execution proceedings filed by the Brazilian federal government, as successor to credits held by the now-dissolved IAA, deriving from the default by Açucareira Nova Tamoio S.A. (which was subsequently merged into Da Barra) with respect to payments under cross-border loans for which the Brazilian federal government acted as gua rantor. The claims involved in these suits amounted to US$55.4 million at April 30, 2008. However, in light of the judicial decision in favor of Da Barra during the second quarter of 2006, our legal advisors reassessed the estimate of loss for these tax collection claims, reducing them to US$27.5 million, which has been reserved for in our consolidated financial statements. As a result of the reassessment of the loss estimate, Da Barra recognized a reversal of the updating of the provision for these claims for the year ended April 30, 2007, in the amount of US$25.4 million, which was recorded under the financial income (expenses), net. The Company opted to settle tax related claims in installments as provided by Brazilian Law No 11.941/09 and in MP 470/09. In September 2006, the Brazilian federal tax authorities issued a tax notice against Cosan in an aggregate amount equal to US$69.7 million, including penalties and interest, related to withholding income tax. Despite what we believe is a remote chance of our success on the administrative level, we believe, based on the advice of our external legal counsel, that it is possible that we will prevail once this matter is brought before a court. We have recorded a provision in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency in the amount of US$104 million. We are also involved in other tax proceedings relating to PIS/COFINS/IPI/IR/CSL/IRF federal taxes, including withholding income tax mentioned above, with claims in an aggregate amount of US$1,380 million as of March 31, 2010. We have established a provision for the tax proceedings in which we believe we will not prevail in the amount of US$173.9 million CCL and its direct subsidiary, Sociedade Técnica e Industrial de Lubrificantes Ltda., or “Solutec”, initiated a lawsuit in 1993 disputing the balance sheet monetary correction index established by the federal government in 1989, which did not reflect inflation in the period. Because of the adoption of the index imposed by the federal government, CCL determined and paid IRPJ and CSLL amounts allegedly higher than should have been due. CCL and Solutec were granted a favorable preliminary injunction ruling regarding recalculation of the balance sheet monetary correction, now using the inflation indices for the period, thus determining new IRPJ and CSLL amounts. The IRPJ and CSLL overpayments were offset in subsequent years until 1997. Despite the favorable decision, tax authorities served Solut ec with a tax deficiency notice relating to the offsets made during the period from 1993 to 1997, whereas CCL was served a notice only in relation to the offset carried out in 1993. In view of the contingent characteristics of such offsets, these amounts were also recorded as provision for judicial demands and are undergoing restatement based on the SELIC rate variation. The aggregate claims amount to US$86.4 million. During the period from June to December 2004, CCL offset amounts due to COFINS and several other taxes against the Finsocial paid prior to such period, based on preliminary injunction under a lawsuit in which the constitutionality of the Finsocial was disputed. In 1995, CCL was declared COFINS immune from COFINS. Accordingly, CCL interpreted that the COFINS amount offset against Finsocial did not, in fact, occur, and in 2003, based on a favorable court decision handed down to CCL in connection with Finsocial, it 101 Table of Contents concluded that the credits relating to such tax offset against COFINS were once again available for offset against other taxes. As such, CCL began offsetting such credits against IRPJ, CSLL, CIDE, PIS, COFINS and IRRF resulting from its operations. Once again, considering the contingent characteristic of this offset, the entire offset amount was recorded as provision for judicial demands, pending approval by the Brazilian federal tax authorities (Receita Federal do Brasil) of such offset. In 2008, the Brazilian federal tax authorities denied the abovementioned offset, claiming that such credits had already been offset against COFINS in 1994. As a result of such position, the management decided to file an administrative appeal against the decision, which is st ill pending judgment. The provision is being monetarily restated based on the SELIC rate variation, amounting to US$173 million. Social Security Proceedings The National Social Security Institute (Instituto Nacional da Seguridade Social), or “INSS”, a Brazilian federal agency, has filed several claims against us. The social security claims that have been filed against us amount to US$147.1 million with respect to differences in payroll contributions to agricultural employees, differences in joint responsibility contributions with hired service providers and differences in the Workmen’s Compensation Insurance contribution, over a period of several years, as well as reimbursement of alleged payments paid improperly to INSS regarding benefits to self-employed workers. We believe that it is probable that we will be required to pay certain of these claims depending on the periods covered thereby. We have recorded a provision in an aggregate amount of US$2 mill ion as of March 31, 2010. Environmental Proceedings We are party to a number of administrative and judicial proceedings regarding environmental matters. We are subject to several public civil actions related to matters including our burning of sugarcane (which is part of the manual sugarcane harvesting process), historical patrimony preservation, and protected areas. We are also subject to over 402 administrative proceedings concerning matters including the burning of sugarcane, liquid effluent discharge, air pollution, damage to environmentally protected areas, death of fish and joint liability in case of environmental damages regarding service stations. Moreover, we are also subject to over 34 judicial proceedings concerning suits filed by service stations and third parties asserting damages for fuel leaks in Esso service stations. As of March 31, 2010, we had establi shed a provision for these contingencies in the amount of US$2.5 million. Labor Claims As of March 31, 2010, there were 2,945 individual labor lawsuits filed against us and the total amount of our potential liability under these lawsuits amounted to a total of US$301million. As of March 31, 2010, we had established a provision for these contingencies in the amount of US$77.2 million. The labor claims principally relate to claims to overtime, risk premiums and wage premiums related to workplace hazards. Other Proceedings We are party to numerous civil lawsuits involving claims that amounted to US$260.9 million in the aggregate as of March 3l, 2010. Based on the opinions of the legal counsel handling these lawsuits, we have recorded a provision for civil contingencies in our consolidated financial statements of US$41.7 million as of March 31, 2010. In accordance with court orders concerning certain tax, civil and labor lawsuits, we had bank accounts frozen in an aggregate amount of US$320,000 as of the present date. We are involved in numerous other lawsuits from time to time, including commercial litigation. On February 28, 2007, the subsidiary Usina da Barra S.A. Açúcar e Álcool recognized financial income in the amount of US$149.1 million. The company had sought damages from the Brazilian federal government for setting prices for its products below the established price control guidelines. In the third quarter of fiscal 102 Table of Contents year 2007, Brazilian courts reached a final and unappealable decision favorable to us. As of March 31, 2010, this account receivable from the government amounted to US$187.4 million. Costa Pinto, one of the entities through which Mr. Rubens Ometto Silveira Mello previously held Cosan’s shares, its officers, directors, members of the fiscal council and controlling shareholders were party to an administrative proceeding initiated by the CVM for non-payment of minimum dividends to preferred shareholders during fiscal years 2000, 2002 and 2003. In this proceeding, it was asserted, among other things, that the equity method of accounting to determine net income available for dividends should not have been used. On July 14, 2004, a special preferred shareholders meeting approved the distribution of the dividends and ratified an agreement between the preferred shareholders and Costa Pinto. The parties entered into a consent decree with the CVM, agreeing to pay a total amount of R$0.3 million, and as of the date of this annual report, all issues relating to such administrative proceeding have been resolved and Costa Pinto has paid all dividends due to its preferred shareholders On August 10, 2007, the CVM requested information from Mr. Rubens Ometto Silveira Mello, in his capacity as chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of Cosan, as to whether he breached any duty of loyalty to Cosan’s minority shareholders under Brazilian law by taking actions to effect the corporate reorganization or by potentially usurping corporate opportunities otherwise available to Cosan, especially with regard to business activities outside of Brazil by our company that could be conducted by Cosan. Mr. Rubens Ometto Silveira Mello informed the CVM on August 14, 2007 that his roles in the corporate reorganization and with respect to the corporate reorganization have been, and will continue to be, conducted in compliance with Brazilian law. In addition, during a meeting held on August 15, 2007, we were informed by CVM commissioners that, in their opinion, future conduct of business activities outside of Brazil by our company, when these activities could be carried out by Cosan, may breach provisions of Brazilian law relating to the duty of loyalty and corporate opportunities. The CVM stated that, if our company pursues in the future corporate opportunities outside Brazil to the detriment of Cosan, the CVM may bring an administrative proceeding against Mr. Rubens Ometto Silveira Mello or us, which we anticipate may result in the imposition of monetary penalties. Mr. Rubens Ometto Silveira Mello has informed us that he believes he has not, and we also believe that we have not, breached any applicable Brazilian law; and, as and if necessary, he and we will s eek to take measures to ensure compliance with such law. On December 5, 2007, following receipt of the approval of the Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting of Cosan, Cosan Limited, Cosan and Mr. Rubens Ometto Silveira Mello executed a “Commitment to Offer Commercial Opportunities,” which regulates the terms and conditions in which the international commercial opportunities developed by Cosan Limited are to be offered to Cosan, allowing Cosan to participate, in accordance with the conditions established under the agreement, in those commercial opportunities. Our company has undertaken to the CVM not to change the steps of the corporate reorganization as described in our registration statement on Form F-4 (Registration No. 333-147235) filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in this annual report, particularly with respect to the exchange offer to be made to Cosan shareholders. Dividends and Dividend Policy Dividend Rights Cosan Limited is a holding company and can only pay dividends to the extent, if any, that funds are received from our subsidiaries. Our dividend policy is similar to the current dividend policy of our main subsidiary, Cosan. Cosan is required by the Brazilian corporate law to distribute (and has historically done so) on an annual basis dividends representing 25% of its net income (as calculated under Brazilian GAAP, subject to certain adjustments mandated by Brazilian corporate law). We intend to pay cash dividends representing on an annual basis 25% of our annual consolidated net income (as calculated under U.S. GAAP), to holders of class A common shares and class B common shares in proportion to the number of shares held by them unless 103 Table of Contents our board of directors has determined, in its discretion, that such distribution would not be advisable or appropriate in light of our financial condition or we are unable to meet applicable statutory solvency requirements under Bermuda law. Cosan has a dividend policy that is similar to that of our company, although the net income is calculated in accordance with Brazilian GAAP (subject to certain adjustments mandated by Brazilian corporate law). Because Brazilian GAAP differs in significant respects from U.S. GAAP, Cosan’s dividends to us may be lower than the corresponding amounts under our dividend policy, which is based upon net income under U.S. GAAP. The main difference between U.S. GAAP and Brazilian GAAP that produces material variances in net income relates to hedging transactions. Under Brazilian GAAP, hedging results are allocated to the income statement together with the result of the underlying asset. Under U.S. GAAP, we “mark to market” our hedging portfolio against financial income (expense). As a result, for U.S. GAAP pur poses, our hedging policy is likely to be responsible for fluctuations in our net income. We expect that differences may occur in the transition fiscal year 2009 and future periods, as Cosan continues to enter into hedging transactions. The amount of Cosan’s dividends to us will also depend upon the level of our future ownership in Cosan’s common shares. In the event of any difference between dividends to be paid under our dividend policy and dividends paid to us by Cosan, our board of directors will be required to decide, at the relevant time, either to pay dividends above 25% of net income (as calculated under U.S. GAAP) or else pay dividends below that 25% level using cash dividends received from Cosan and any other subsidiaries. Our board of directors may, in its discretion, amend or repeal our dividend policy. You may not receive the level of dividends provided for in the dividend policy or any dividends at all due to a number of factors, such as: · we are a holding company, and therefore, our ability to pay dividend will depend on our ability to receive distributions from our subsidiaries, particularly our subsidiary Cosan; · our subsidiaries may become subject to covenants restricting their ability to distribute dividends under credit facilities, term loans or other indebtedness; · any imposition of restrictions on conversions and remittances by the Brazilian government could hinder or prevent us from converting into U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies and remitting abroad dividends of our Brazilian subsidiaries; · our shareholders have no contractual or other legal rights to dividends pursuant to Bermuda law; and · we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends due to changes in our operating earnings, working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs. Under Bermuda law, a company’s board of directors may declare and pay dividends from time to time unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that the company is or would, after the payment, be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or that the realizable value of its assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and issued share capital and share premium accounts. Under our bye-laws, each class A common share and class B common share is entitled to dividends if, as and when dividends are declared by our board of directors, subject to any preferred dividend right of holders of any preference shares. There are no restrictions on our ability to transfer funds (other than funds denominated in Bermuda dollars) in or out of Bermuda or to pay dividends to U.S. residents who are hold ers of our common shares. We expect to have sufficient available cash to pay dividends in accordance with our dividend policy. We do not, however, plan to pay dividends in the event that we do not generate sufficient cash from operations. In addition, we will not pay dividends if we believe that such payment will limit or preclude our or our subsidiaries’ ability to pursue growth opportunities. Although our bye-laws and Cosan’s bye-laws do not restrict us from borrowing funds to pay dividends, we do not intend to borrow funds to pay dividends. 104 Table of Contents The dividend rights attaching to our class A common shares and class B common shares are not cumulative in the event that we do not, for any reason, pay dividends on those shares. Any cash dividends payable to holders of our common shares quoted on the NYSE will be paid to Mellon Investors Services LLC, our transfer agent in the United States, for disbursement to those holders. As of March 31, 2010, there were no retained earnings available for dividends. Cosan’s Dividend Policy Brazilian corporate law and Cosan’s bye-laws require that Cosan distributes annually to its shareholders a mandatory minimum dividend, unless Cosan’s board of directors notifies the shareholders that such distribution is not advisable in light of Cosan’s financial condition as reflected in Cosan’s financial statements in accordance with Brazilian GAAP. The mandatory dividend is equal to 25% of Cosan’s net income for the prior year (as calculated under Brazilian GAAP, subject to certain adjustments mandated by Brazilian corporate law). The mandatory dividend may be made in the form of dividends or interest on shareholders equity, which may be deducted by Cosan in calculating its income and social contribution tax obligations. The declaration of annual dividends, including dividends in exces s of the mandatory distribution, requires approval by the vote of a majority of the holders of Cosan’s common shares and depends on numerous factors. These factors include Cosan’s results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, financial covenant limitations, and other factors deemed relevant by Cosan’s board of directors and shareholders. Cosan’s board of directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which Cosan has distributed as dividends and/or interest on shareholders equity in the amount of approximately 25% of Cosan’s net income for each fiscal year. Under Brazilian corporate law, Cosan may establish income reserve accounts composed of a legal reserve, an investments reserve and/or a retained profit reserve. The balance of such income reserve accounts must not exceed the amount of Cosan’s capital stock and any excess amounts must either be incorporated to its capital stock or distributed as dividends. Cosan currently does not h ave any income reserve accounts, but may establish them in the future. Cosan has historically paid cash distributions. The following table sets forth Cosan’s dividend distributions calculated, under Brazilian GAAP, for each of the last five fiscal years: Fiscal Year Total Dividend Distribution (in millions of US$) 2006 — 2007 37.3 2008 — 2009 — 2010 113.0 Brazilian Taxation Dividends paid by Cosan to us are currently not subject to withholding income tax in Brazil, to the extent that such amounts are related to profits generated as of January 1, 1996. In addition, Brazilian tax laws permit Cosan to make distributions to shareholders of interest on shareholders’ equity and treat those payments as a deductible expense for purposes of calculating Brazilian income tax and social contributions. For tax purposes, this interest is limited to the daily pro rata portion of the TJLP, as determined by the Central Bank from time to time, and the amount of the deduction is limited to (1) 50% of net income (after social contributions but before income tax and the amount to be distributed as interest on shareholders’ equity) related to the period in respect of which the payment is made; or ( 2) 50% of the sum of retained profits and profit reserves as of the date of the beginning of the period in respect of which the payment is made. A payment to us of interest on shareholders’ equity is subject to withholding income tax at the rate of 25%. 105 Table of Contents B.
