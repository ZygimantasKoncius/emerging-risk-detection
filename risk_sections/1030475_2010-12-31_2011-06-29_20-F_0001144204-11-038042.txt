D. Risk Factors” or in other parts of this Annual Report. Overview Our primary business is the provision of domestic, regional (which includes Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) and international passenger and cargo airline services. Our overall capacity on an available tonne kilometer, or ATK, basis increased by 43.0%, from 12,505.5 ATKs in 2009 to 17,887.4 ATKs in 2010, and our passenger capacity on an available seat kilometer, or ASK, basis increased by 41.4%, from 84,456.4 million ASKs in 2009 to 119,450.9 ASKs in 2010. Total traffic on a revenue tonne kilometer, or RTK, basis increased by 59.3%, from 7,908.7 RTKs in 2009 to 12,599.0 RTKs in 2010. The historical results of operations discussed in this Annual Report may not be indicative of our future operating performance. Like those of other airlines, our operations depend substantially on overall passenger and cargo traffic volume and are subject to seasonal and other variations that may influence passenger travel demand and cargo volume and may not be under our control, including unusual political events, changes in the domestic and global economies and other unforeseen events. Our operations will be affected by, among other things, fluctuations in aviation fuel prices, aircraft acquisition and leasing costs, maintenance expenses, take-off and landing charges, wages, salaries and benefits, other operating expenses and the rates of income taxes paid. Our financial performance is also significantly affected by factors associated with operating in a highly regulated industry, as well as a number of other external variables, including political and economic conditions in China, competition, foreign exchange fluctuations and public perceptions of the safety of air travel with Chinese airlines. Because nearly every aspect of our airline operations is subject to the regulation of the CAAC, our operating revenues and expenses are directly affected by the CAAC regulations with respect to, among other things, domestic airfares, level of commissions paid to sales agents, the aviation fuel price, take-off and landing charges and route allocations. The nature and extent of airline competition and the ability of Chinese airlines to expand are also significantly affected by various CAAC regulations and policies. Changes in the CAAC’s regulatory policies, or in the implementation of such policies, are therefore likely to have a significant impact on our future operations. Operating Segments The Company presents segment information in a manner that is similar to the management’s internal reporting. The Company is principally engaged in the operation of civil aviation, including the provision of passenger, cargo and other extended transportation services and are managed as a single business unit. The Company has one reportable operating segment, reported as “airline operations”. See Note 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements. 42 Acquisitions We entered into an agreement with Shanghai Airlines on July 10, 2009 to issue a maximum of 1,694,838,860 A Shares to the shareholders of Shanghai Airlines in exchange for all the existing issued shares of Shanghai Airlines. The acquisition price was RMB9,118 million, which was determined based on the quoted market price of our shares issued as of the date nearest to the acquisition date, with adjustments to reflect specific restrictions to certain shares that were issued. On January 28, 2010, we completed the exchange of 1,694,838,860 A Shares for all existing issued shares of Shanghai Airlines and Shanghai Airlines became a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Company. A.

Revenues increased in each of our passenger and cargo and mail business operations, primarily due to the robust demand for aviation services as a result of the rapid growth of the Chinese economy, the substantial increase in our scale of operations after the absorption of Shanghai Airlines, as well as the increase in passenger travel created by the Shanghai World Expo and the enhancement of our marketing capabilities. In 2010, we transported a total of 64,930 thousand passengers, representing an increase of 47.4%, from 44,043 thousand passengers in 2009. Our total passenger traffic (as measured in RPKs) increased by 52.9%, from 60,942 million passenger-kilometers in 2009 to 93,153 million passenger-kilometers in 2010 and our total cargo and mail traffic (as measured in RFTKs) increased by 74.14%, from 2,474 million freight tonne-kilometers in 2009 to 4,308 million freight tonne-kilometers in 2010. Our average yield for our passenger operations increased by 16.7%, from RMB0.54 per passenger-kilometer in 2009 to RMB0.63 per passenger-kilometer in 2010 primarily due to increased passenger travel on our various segments. Our average yield for our cargo and mail operations increased by 16.8% from RMB1.7 per tonne-kilometer in 2009 to RMB2.0 per tonne-kilometer in 2010, primarily due to increased import/export activity resulting in increased demand for air cargo and mail services. The following chart sets forth our revenue breakdown for the years 2009 and 2010: 2010 vs. 2009 Year ended December 31, Increase % increase 2010 2009 (decrease) (decrease) (in millions of RMB) Traffic revenues(1) 67,391 36,925 30,466 82.5 % Passenger 58,968 32,800 26,168 79.8 % Passenger revenue excluding fuel surcharges 54,625 31,436 23,189 73.8 % Fuel surcharges 4,343 1,364 2,979 218.4 % Cargo and mail 8,423 4,125 4,298 104.2 % Cargo and mail revenue excluding fuel surcharges 5,810 3,017 2,793 92.6 % Fuel surcharges 2,613 1,108 1,505 135.8 % Others (2) 6,413 2,065 4,348 210.6 % Total operating revenue 73,804 38,990 34,814 89. 3 % (1) Pursuant to relevant tax rules and regulations in the PRC, the major elements of the Company’s traffic revenues, commission income, ground service income, cargo handling income and other revenues are subject to business tax levied at rates of 3% or 5%. Pursuant to the notice of exemption of business tax on the provision of international transportation services (Cai Shui [2010] No. 8), jointly issued by Ministry of Finance and the State Tax Bureau, our Group’s revenues from the provision of international transportation services were exempt from business tax as of 1 January 2010. The business tax incurred and set off against the above Company’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 amounted to approximately RMB1,463 million (2009: RMB1,019 million). (2) Includes ground service income, cargo handling income, commission income and others. Passenger revenues Our passenger traffic revenues increased by RMB26,168 million, or 79.8%, from RMB32,800 million in 2009 to RMB58,968 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to the robust demand in the domestic and international aviation markets, increased flight capacity and marketing activities launched by the Company to closely reflect market demand, and the increase in passenger load factor, domestic routes and ticket price levels as a result of the absorption of Shanghai Airlines. Passenger traffic revenues accounted for 79.9% of our total traffic revenues in 2010. 44 Our domestic passenger traffic revenues (excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan passenger revenues), which accounted for 71.5% of our total passenger traffic revenues in 2010, increased by 75.3%, from RMB24,038 million in 2009 to RMB42,143 million in 2010. The increase was mainly due to robust demand for domestic flights resulting from the continued growth of the PRC economy, enhanced marketing activities launched by our Company to reflect market demand and an increase in passenger load factor, domestic routes and ticket price levels as a result of the absorption of Shanghai Airlines. Compared to 2009, our domestic passenger traffic (as measured in RPKs) increased by 49.4%, from 44,376 million in 2009 to 66,310 million in 2010. The number of passengers carried on domestic routes increased by 46.0%, from 38.0 million in 2009 to 55.5 million in 2010. Our passenger-kilometers yield for domestic routes increased from RMB0.54 per passenger-kilometer in 2009 to RMB0.64 per passenger-kilometer in 2010. Our regional passenger traffic revenues (representing Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan passenger revenues) which accounted for 5.4% of our total passenger traffic revenues in 2010, increased by 94.8%, from RMB1,630 million in 2009 to RMB3,176 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to the robust demand for regional flights, which led to increased passenger traffic volume on our regional flights, as well as an increase in flight capacity and routes, which led to an increase of 58.3%, from 2,573 million in 2009 to 4,074 million in 2010, in our regional passenger traffic (as measured in RPKs). The number of passengers carried on Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan routes increased by 52.4%, from 1.9 million in 2009 to 2.9 million in 2010. Our passenger-kilometers yield for regional routes increased from RMB0.63 per passenger-kilometer in 2009 to RMB0.78 per passenger-kilometer in 2010. International passenger traffic revenues, which accounted for 23.2% of our total passenger traffic revenues in 2010, increased by 91.4%, from RMB7,133 million in 2009 to RMB13,650 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to the increased demand for international aviation services, which led to increased passenger traffic volume on our international flights, as well as the ancillary effects of the Shanghai World Expo, which increased international travel demand overseas to Shanghai. Our international passenger traffic (as measured in RPKs) increased by 62.7% in 2010, from 13,994 million in 2009 to 22,769 million in 2010. The number of passengers carried on international routes increased by 57.1%, from 4.2 million in 2009 to 6.6 million in 2010. Our passenger-kilometers yield for international routes increased from RMB0.51 per passenger-kilometer in 2009 to RMB0.60 per passenger-kilometer in 2010. Cargo and mail revenues Our cargo and mail traffic revenues increased by RMB4,299 million, or 104.2%, from RMB4,124 million in 2009 to RMB8,423 million in 2010, which accounted for 12.5% of our total traffic revenues in 2010. Revenue from cargo and mail traffic via bellyhold cargo space on the Company’s passenger aircraft was RMB2,744 million, which accounted for 32.6% of total freight revenue and 4.1% of total traffic revenue in 2010. Cargo and mail yield increased from RMB1.67 in 2009 to RMB1.95 in 2010 per cargo tonne-kilometer, or 16.8% compared to the same period in 2009, primarily as a result of continued growth of import and export activity, which resulted in increased demand for air cargo and mail services, as well as our Company's enhanced market analysis measures, better operating efficiency in these operations and enhanced cooperation with third parties companies. Our domestic cargo and mail traffic revenues (excluding Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau cargo and mail revenues), which accounted for 14.9% of our total cargo and mail traffic revenues in 2010, increased by 51.8%, from RMB828 million in 2009 to RMB1,257 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to increased trade activity in the PRC, resulting in additional demand for cargo and mail services. Our freight tonne-kilometers yield for domestic routes increased from RMB1.13 per tonne-kilometer in 2009 to RMB1.28 per tonne-kilometer in 2010. Our regional cargo and mail traffic revenues (representing Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan cargo and mail traffic revenues), which accounted for 8.4% of our total cargo and mail traffic revenues in 2010, increased by 101.7%, from RMB350 million in 2009 to RMB706 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our regional cargo and mail traffic as a result of increased regional economic activity, resulting in additional demand for cargo and mail services. Our freight tonne-kilometers yield for regional routes increased from RMB4.13 per tonne-kilometer to RMB4.54 per tonne-kilometer. 45 International cargo and mail traffic revenues, which accounted for 76.7% of our total cargo and mail traffic revenues in 2010, increased by 119.3%, from RMB2,946 million in 2009 to RMB6,460 million in 2010, due to increased demand for cargo and mail transportation capacity as the global economy recovered from the recession, resulting in an increase in the amount of cargo and mail carried as well as an increase in cargo and mail transportation prices. Our prices for cargo and mail transportation on international routes also increased as our freight tonne-kilometers yield for international routes increased from RMB1.78 per tonne-kilometer in 2009 to RMB2.04 per tonne-kilometer in 2010. Other revenues We also generated revenues from other services, including airport ground services, cargo handling services and ticket handling services. These services include loading and unloading of cargo, aircraft cleaning and ground transportation of cargo and passenger luggage for aircraft arriving at or departing from Hongqiao International Airport and Pudong International Airport of Shanghai. We are currently the principal provider of airport ground services at both Hongqiao International Airport and Pudong International Airport. Our total other revenues increased by 210.7%, from RMB2,065 million in 2009 to RMB6,413 million in 2010, as a result of the increase provision of these services in response to increased demand for these services at Hongqiao and Pudong airports, primarily due to increased flight activity at these airports. Operating Expenses The following chart sets forth a breakdown of our operating expenses for the years 2009 and 2010: 2010 vs. 2009 Year Ended December 31, Increase % increase 2010 2009 (decrease) (decrease) (in millions of RMB) Operating Expenses: Aircraft fuel expenses 21,606 12,255 9,351 76.3 % Takeoff and landing charges 7,455 5,460 1,995 36.5 % Depreciation and amortization 6,758 5,203 1,555 29.9 % Salaries and related costs 8,941 5,149 3,792 73.7 % Office, administration and other 7,284 3,752 3,532 94.1 % Maintenance costs 4,614 3,019 1,595 52.8 % Aircraft operating lease expenses 3,976 2,518 1,458 57.9 % Impairment losses for assets 405 109 296 271.6 % Selling and marketing expenses 3,324 1,978 1,346 68.1 % Other 4,402 (987) 5,389 546 % Total operating expense 68,765 38,456 30,309 78.8 % Our total operating expenses increased by 78.8%, from RMB38,456 million in 2009 to RMB68,765 million in 2010 primarily due to the significant expansion in the operating scale of our Company upon the absorption of Shanghai Airlines, resulting in increased operational expenses and fees, as well as the increased costs resulting from the substantial increase in aviation fuel prices. Our total operating expenses as a percentage of our revenues decreased from 98.6% in 2009 to 93.2% in 2010. Aircraft fuel expenses increased by 76.3%, from RMB12,255 million in 2009 to RMB21,606 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of the Company’s scale of operations and an increase in the average price of aviation fuel compared to the same period in the previous year. In 2010, we consumed a total of approximately 3.85 million tonnes of aviation fuel, representing an increase of 46.4% compared to 2009. Our weighted average fuel price per tonne in 2010 increased by approximately 20.0% from 2009. Aircraft fuel expenses accounted for 31.4% of our total operating expenses in 2010, as compared to 31.9% in 2009. 46 Changes in fair value of financial derivatives decreased to a gain of RMB833 million, compared to RMB3,775 million during the same period in 2009. The difference was mainly due to reversal of the fair value of crude oil option contracts resulting from the increase in international crude oil prices in 2009, whereas international oil prices in 2010 were relatively stable and the magnitude of the reversal of fair value of crude oil option contracts were less significant. In 2010, the net gain on change in fair value of crude oil option contracts (inclusive of the factor of cash outflow upon settlement) was approximately RMB800 million. However, we may not be able to experience such similar gains in 2011, as crude oil prices have risen significantly in early 2011. In 2010, the fair value movements of financial derivatives charged to the income statement accounted for 1.2% of our total operating expenses. Take-off and landing charges, which accounted for 10.1% of our total operating expenses in 2010, increased by 36.5%, from RMB5,460 million in 2009 to RMB7,455 million in 2010 primarily due to an increase of in the number of take-offs and landings resulting from our increased scale of operations in 2010. Depreciation and amortization increased by 29.9%, from RMB5,203 million in 2009 to RMB6,758 million in 2010. The increase in depreciation and amortization costs was primarily due to the expansion of the scale of the Company’s operations and an increase in the number of our aircraft, as well as new property acquired by our Company at Hongqiao International Airport. Wages, salaries and benefits, which accounted for 13.0% of our total operating expenses in 2010, increased by 73.7%, from RMB5,149 million in 2009 to RMB8,941 million in 2010, primarily due to the continued expansion of our core businesses. Office, administration and other expenses increased by 94.1%, from RMB3,752 million in 2009 to RMB7,284 million in 2010 primarily due to the Company’s increased in non-aviation business upon the absorption of Shanghai Airlines, which led to an increase in certain costs and expenses. Selling and marketing expenses, which accounted for 4.8% of our total operating expenses in 2010, increased by 68.1%, from RMB1,978 million in 2009 to RMB3,324 million in 2010. The increase was primarily a result of increases in sales volumes and the number of passengers carried, which led to a corresponding increase in sales agency handling fees. Aircraft operating lease expenses increased by 57.9%, from RMB2,518 million in 2009 to RMB3,976 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of the Company’s scale upon the absorption of Shanghai Airlines. Aircraft maintenance expenses, which accounted for 6.7% of our total operating expenses in 2010, increased by 52.8%, from RMB3,019 million in 2009 to RMB4,614 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in maintenance costs realized by not sending aircraft to foreign countries for maintenance, as the result of an increase in domestic maintenance capacity in China. Impairment losses for assets increased by 271.6%, from a loss of RMB109 million in 2009 to a loss of RMB405 million in 2010, primarily as a result of our proposed disposal of certain aircraft and related engines, which resulted in a provision for impairment loss charge of RMB239 million. In an effort to increase the operational efficiency of, and reduce the related maintenance fees for, our fleet, these aircraft and engines were classified as non-current assets held for sale, and the impairment charge was made in accordance with estimated market values. Other Operating Income and Other Gains Our other operating income and other gains were primarily generated from government subsidies and gains on disposal of aircraft and relevant assets. The total amount of our other operating income and other gains decreased from RMB1,288 million in 2009 to RMB658 million in 2010 primarily due to the refund of civil aviation infrastructure levies of RMB832 million in 2009. Other government subsidies represent subsidies granted to us by the PRC government and local government as well as other subsidies granted by various local municipalities to encourage our Company to operate certain routes to cities where these municipalities are located. 47 Finance Costs Our finance costs decreased by 14.4%, from RMB1,755 million in 2009 to RMB1,502 million in 2010, primarily due to improvement of our debt structure and the decrease in overall LIBOR floating rates from 2009 to 2010. Approximately 20% of our indebtedness is U.S. dollar denominated borrowings, which are generally tied to LIBOR rates. In 2010, our finance income was RMB1,155 million, primarily due to the increase in exchange gain resulting from the appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. Profit / (Loss) attributable to the owners of parent As a result of the foregoing operating results, the net profit attributable to owners of the parent increased to RMB4,958 million in 2010, representing a 2,833.7% increase as compared to a net profit of RMB169 million in 2009. Fixed Assets Our Company had approximately RMB68,822 million of fixed assets and construction in progress as of December 31, 2010, including, among other assets, aircraft, engines and flight equipment, representing a 21.37% increase from RMB56,704 million in 2009. 2009 Compared to 2008 Revenues Our revenues decreased by 5.1%, from RMB41,073 million in 2008 to RMB38,990 million in 2009 (net of the applicable PRC business tax). Revenues decreased in each of our passenger and cargo and mail business operations, due primarily to decreased average yield. In 2009, we transported a total of 44.0 million passengers, representing an increase of 18.3%, from 37.2 million passengers in 2008. Our total passenger traffic (as measured in RPKs) increased by 13.3%, from 53,785 million passenger-kilometers in 2008 to 60,942 million passenger-kilometers in 2009 and our total cargo and mail traffic (as measured in RFTKs) increased by 2.2%, from 2,420 million freight tonne-kilometers in 2008 to 2,474, million freight tonne-kilometers in 2009. Our average yield for our passenger operations decreased by 12.9%, from RMB0.62 per passenger-kilometer in 2008 to RMB0.54 per passenger-kilometer in 2009 primarily due to the global financial crisis, resulting in a decrease in business travel activity and the decrease in passengers on our international routes. Our average yield for our cargo and mail operations decreased by 24.4%, from RMB2.2 per tonne-kilometer in 2008 to RMB1.7 per tonne-kilometer in 2009, primarily due to the global financial crisis, resulting in reduced demand for cargo and mail transportation capacity and a reduction in cargo and mail transportation prices. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in per-unit revenue as a result of the decrease in demand on regional and international flights resulting from the global financial crisis and the decrease in our fuel surcharge income. We suspended fuel surcharges on our domestic flights for the first half of 2009 due to a decrease in international crude oil prices during that period, but resumed fuel surcharges in November 2009. 48 The following chart sets forth our revenue breakdown for the years 2008 and 2009: 2009 vs. 2008 Year ended December 31, Increase % increase 2009 2008 (decrease) (decrease) (in millions of RMB) Traffic revenues 36,925 38,844 (1,919 ) (4.9 )% Passenger 32,800 33,486 (686 ) (2.0 )% Passenger revenue excluding fuel surcharges 31,436 27,875 3,561 12.8 % Fuel surcharges 1,364 5,611 (4,247 ) (75.7 )% Cargo and mail 4,125 5,358 (1,233 ) (23.0 )% Cargo and mail revenue excluding fuel surcharges 3,017 3,772 (755 ) (20 )% Fuel surcharges 1,108 1,586 (478 ) (30.1 )% Others (1) 2,065 2,228 (163 ) (7.3 )% Total operating revenue (2) 38,990 41,072 (2,082 ) (5.1 )% (1) Includes ground service income, cargo handling income, commission income and others. (2) Pursuant to the relevant tax rules and regulations in the PRC, the major elements of the Company’s traffic revenues, commission income, ground service income, cargo handling income and other revenues are subject to business tax levied at rates of 3% or 5%. The business tax incurred and set off against the above Company’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 amounted to approximately RMB1,019 million (2008: RMB891 million). Passenger revenues Our passenger traffic revenues decreased by RMB686 million, or 2.0%, from RMB33,486 million in 2008 to RMB32,800 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in fuel surcharges income as well as the lack of demand resulting from the financial crisis. Passenger traffic revenues accounted for 88.8% of our total traffic revenues in 2009. Our domestic passenger traffic revenues (excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan passenger revenues), which accounted for 73.3% of our total passenger traffic revenues in 2009, increased by 12.4%, from RMB21,389 million in 2008 to RMB24,038 million in 2009. The increase was mainly due to the positive adjustment of our transportation capacity and the growth in, and allocation to, domestic passenger traffic capacity, which increased by 24.5% from 2008 to 2009. Compared to 2008, our domestic passenger traffic (as measured in RPKs) increased by 25.5%, from 35,352 million in 2008 to 44,376 million in 2009. The number of passengers carried on domestic routes increased by 25.0%, from 30.4 million in 2008 to 38.0 million in 2009. Our passenger-kilometers yield for domestic routes decreased from RMB0.61 per passenger-kilometer in 2008 to RMB0.54 per passenger-kilometer in 2009. Our regional passenger traffic revenues (representing Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan passenger revenues) which accounted for 5.0% of our total passenger traffic revenues in 2009, decreased by 17.0% from RMB1,963 million in 2008 to RMB1,630 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to intensified competition and a significant decrease in the demand for transportation capacity, which led to a decrease of 15.9%, from 3,058 million in 2008 to 2,573 million in 2009, in our regional passenger traffic (as measured in RPKs). The number of passengers carried on Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan routes decreased by 11.8%, from 2.1 million in 2008 to 1.9 million in 2009. Our passenger-kilometers yield for regional routes decreased from RMB0.64 per passenger-kilometer in 2008 to RMB0.63 per passenger-kilometer in 2009. International passenger traffic revenues, which accounted for 21.7% of our total passenger traffic revenues in 2009, decreased by 29.6%, from RMB10,134 million in 2008 to RMB7,133 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the intensified effect of the global financial crisis on international air transportation, as a result of which we continued to reduce the number of flights on long-distance routes to Europe, the United States and other destinations. Our international passenger traffic (as measured in RPKs) decreased by 9.0% in 2009, from 15,375 million in 2008 to 13,994 million in 2009. The number of passengers carried on international routes decreased by 11.1%, from 4.7 million in 2008 to 4.2 million in 2009. Our passenger-kilometers yield for international routes decreased from RMB0.66 per passenger-kilometer in 2008 to RMB0.51 per passenger-kilometer in 2009. 49 Cargo and mail revenues Our cargo and mail traffic revenues decreased by RMB1,233 million, or 23.0%, from RMB5,358 million in 2008 to RMB4,124 million in 2009, which accounted for 11.2% of our total traffic revenues in 2009. Revenue from cargo and mail traffic via bellyhold cargo space on the Company’s passenger aircraft was RMB1,725 million, which accounted for 41.8% of total freight revenue and 4.7% of total traffic revenue in 2009. Cargo and mail yield decreased from RMB2.21 in 2008 to RMB1.67 in 2009 per cargo tonne-kilometer, or 24.4% compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to a decrease in cargo market prices as a result of the financial crisis, which caused a substantial decrease in our international and regional freight transportation capacity and caused a significant decrease in our cargo and mail revenue. Although there were initial signs of recovery for the freight transportation market in the fourth quarter of 2009, it was not sufficient to offset the impact of the financial crisis on the Company's freight transportation business. Our domestic cargo and mail traffic revenues (excluding Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau cargo and mail revenues), which accounted for 20.0% of our total cargo and mail traffic revenues in 2009, increased by 5.5%, from RMB785 million in 2008 to RMB828 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to an increase of 14.4% in the weight of cargo and mail carried on our domestic routes from 463 million kilograms in 2008 to 530 million kilograms in 2009. Compared to 2008, our domestic cargo and mail traffic (as measured in RFTKs) increased by 17.9%, from 622 million in 2008 to 733 million in 2009. The weight of cargo and mail carried on domestic routes slightly increased by 14.4%, from 463 million kilograms in 2008 to 530 million kilograms in 2009. Our freight tonne-kilometers yield for domestic routes decreased from RMB1.26 per tonne-kilometer in 2008 to RMB1.13 per tonne-kilometer in 2009. Our regional cargo and mail traffic revenues (representing Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan cargo and mail traffic revenues), which accounted for 8.5% of our total cargo and mail traffic revenues in 2009, decreased by 28.4%, from RMB489 million in 2008 to RMB350 million in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 23.4%, from 111 million in 2008 to 85 million in 2009, in our regional cargo and mail traffic (as measured in RFTKs). The amount of cargo and mail carried on our Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau routes also decreased by 13.1%, from 76 million kilograms in 2008 to 66 million (as measured in RFTKs) in 2009. Our freight tonne-kilometers yield for regional routes decreased from RMB4.42 per tonne-kilometer to RMB4.13 per tonne-kilometer. International cargo and mail traffic revenues, which accounted for 71.4% of our total cargo and mail traffic revenues in 2009, decreased by 27.9%, from RMB4,083 million in 2008 to RMB2,946 million in 2009, due to reduced demand for cargo and mail transportation capacity during the financial crisis, resulting in a decrease in the amount of cargo and mail carried and a decrease in cargo and mail transportation prices. The amount of cargo and mail transported on our international routes decreased by 0.7%, from 350 million kilograms in 2008 to 348 million kilograms in 2009. Our prices for cargo and mail transportation on international routes also decreased as our freight tonne-kilometers yield for international routes decreased from RMB2.42 per tonne-kilometer in 2008 to RMB1.78 per tonne-kilometer in 2009. Other revenues We also generated revenues from other services, including airport ground services, cargo handling services and ticket handling services. These services include loading and unloading of cargo, aircraft cleaning and ground transportation of cargo and passenger luggage for aircraft arriving at or departing from Hongqiao International Airport and Pudong International Airport of Shanghai. We are currently the principal provider of airport ground services at both Hongqiao International Airport and Pudong International Airport. Our total other revenues decreased by 7.3% from RMB2,228 million in 2008 to RMB2,065 million in 2009 due to increased competition in the logistics business. 50 Operating Expenses The following chart sets forth a breakdown of our operating expenses for the years 2008 and 2009: 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31, increase % increase 2009 2008 (decrease) (decrease) (in millions of RMB) Operating Expenses: Aircraft fuel expenses 12,255 18,488 (6,233 ) (33.7 )% Takeoff and landing charges 5,460 5,280 180 3.4 % Depreciation and amortization 5,203 4,782 421 8.8 % Salaries and related costs 5,149 4,545 604 13.3 % Office, administration and other 3,752 4,056 (304 ) (7.5 )% Maintenance costs 3,019 3,273 (254 ) (7.8 )% Aircraft operating lease expenses 2,518 2,735 (217 ) (7.9 )% Impairment losses for assets 109 2,977 (2,868 ) (96.3 )% Selling and marketing expenses 1,978 1,563 415 26.6 % Other (987) 9,129 (10,116 ) (110.8 )% Total operating expense 38,456 56,828 (18,372 ) (32.3 )% Our total operating expenses decreased by 32.3%, from RMB56,828 million in 2008 to RMB38,456 million in 2009 primarily due to a significant decrease in aviation fuel expenses, decrease in aircraft maintenance expenses decrease in impairment losses, decrease in aircraft operating lease rentals and a decrease in office, administrative and other expenses. Our total operating expenses as a percentage of our revenues decreased from 138.4% in 2008 to 98.6% in 2009. Aircraft fuel expenses decreased by 33.7%, from RMB18,488 million in 2008 to RMB12,255 million in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a substantial decline of approximately 38.6% in the average price of aviation fuel. In 2009, we consumed a total of approximately 2.6 million tonnes of aviation fuel, representing an increase of 8.2% compared to 2008. Our weighted average fuel price per tonne in 2009 decreased substantially by approximately 38.6% from 2008. Aircraft fuel expenses accounted for 31.9% of our total operating expenses in 2009, as compared to 32.5% in 2008. Changes in fair value of financial derivatives resulted in a reversal and gain of RMB3,775 million, compared to a loss of RMB6,401 million during the same period in 2008. The difference was mainly due to the increase of 79.5% in international oil prices at the end of 2009 compared with the end of 2008. In 2009, the fair value movements of financial derivatives charged to the income statement accounted for 9.8% of our total operating expenses. As of December 31, 2009, the gain in fair value in our aviation fuel hedging contracts had contributed to the profit of our Company in the amount of approximately RMB3,744 million. Take-off and landing charges, which accounted for 14.2% of our total operating expenses in 2009, increased by 3.4% from RMB5,280 million in 2008 to RMB5,460 million in 2009 primarily due to an increase in the number of take-offs and landings of approximately 14.9% as compared to the same period in 2008. Depreciation and amortization increased by 8.8%, from RMB4,782 million in 2008 to RMB5,203 million in 2009. The increase in depreciation and amortization costs was primarily due to the expansion of the scale of the Company’s operations and an increase in the number of our aircraft, as well as new property acquired by the Company at Hongqiao International Airport. Wages, salaries and benefits, which accounted for 13.4% of our total operating expenses in 2009, increased by 13.3%, from RMB4,545 million in 2008 to RMB5,149 million in 2009, primarily due to the continued expansion of our core businesses. Office, administration and other expenses decreased by 7.5%, from RMB4,056 million in 2008 to RMB3,752 million in 2009 primarily due to the Company’s increased efforts to control costs, which lead to a general decrease in certain costs and expenses. 51 Selling and marketing expenses, which accounted for 5.1% of our total operating expenses in 2009, increased by 26.6%, from RMB1,563 million in 2008 to RMB1,978 million in 2009. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in the number of passengers carried and the corresponding increase in agency business handling fees. Aircraft operating lease expenses decreased by 7.9%, from RMB2,735 million in 2008 to RMB2,518 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the surrender in 2009 of operating leases for six aircraft, namely, five B737-300 aircraft and one B737-800 aircraft, partially offset by new operating leases on two B737-800 aircraft. Aircraft maintenance expenses, which accounted for 7.8% of our total operating expenses in 2009, decreased by 7.8% from RMB3,273 million in 2008 to RMB3,019 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in maintenance costs realized by not sending aircraft to foreign countries for maintenance, as the result of an increase in domestic maintenance capacity in China. Impairment losses for assets decreased from RMB2,977 million in 2008 to RMB109 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in impairment provisions as no significant impairment provisions were made in 2009, while impairment provisions were made in 2008 for goodwill and certain models of aircraft and relevant flight equipment, and impairment provisions made for fixed assets held for sale. Other Operating Income and Other Gains Our other operating income and other gains were primarily generated from government subsidies and gains on disposal of aircraft and relevant assets. The total amount of our other operating income and other gains increased from RMB672 million in 2008 to RMB1,288 million in 2009, primarily due to the refund of civil aviation infrastructure levies of RMB832 million in 2009. Other government subsidies represent subsidies granted to us by the PRC government and local government as well as other subsidies granted by various local municipalities to encourage our Company to operate certain routes to cities where these municipalities are located. Finance Costs Our finance costs decreased by 24.6% from RMB2,328 million in 2008 to RMB1,755 million in 2009, primarily due to the decrease of 27.5% in interest on loans from banks and other financial institutions, from RMB1,940 million in 2008 to RMB1,407 million in 2009, as well as the decrease of 24.6% in interest relating to obligations under finance leases, from RMB646 million in 2008 to RMB487 million in 2009. The decrease in interest rates was primarily due to the lowering of interest rates in 2009 due to the economic downturn. In addition, we used a portion of the proceeds from our share issuances in 2009 to repay a portion of the principal of our outstanding loans, resulting in a decrease in our finance costs in 2009. Profit / (Loss) attributable to owners of the parent As a result of the foregoing operating results, the net profit attributable to owners of the parent was RMB169 million in 2009, as compared to a net loss of RMB15,269 million in 2008. Fixed Assets Our Company had approximately RMB56,704 million of fixed assets as of December 31, 2009, including aircraft, engines and flight equipment. B. Liquidity and Capital Resources We typically finance our working capital requirements through a combination of funds generated from operations and short-term bank loans. As a result, our liquidity could be materially and adversely affected to the extent there is a significant decrease in demand for our services or if there is any delay in obtaining bank loans. 52 As of December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, we had RMB3,451 million, RMB1,735 million and RMB3,078 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents; RMB35,101 million, RMB25,335 million and RMB38,566 million, respectively, in outstanding borrowings; and RMB2,160 million, RMB428 million and RMB1,486 million, respectively, in restricted bank deposits. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on hand and deposits that are placed with banks and other financial institutions. We plan to use the remaining available cash for other capital expenditures, including expenditures for aircraft, engines and related equipment, as well as for working capital and other day-to-day operating purposes. As of December 31, 2010, our accumulated losses amounted to approximately RMB12,956 million. In addition, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately RMB27,184 million. As a consequence, our Directors have taken active steps to seek additional sources of financing to improve our liquidity position. As of December 31, 2010, we had total credit facilities of RMB47.03 billion from various banks, of which RMB30.72 billion are not utilized. See the discussion below under “–Working Capital and Liabilities”. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term borrowings and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months. We may, however, require additional cash due to changing business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions that we may decide to pursue. Cash Flows from Operating Activities In 2010, we generated a net cash inflow from operating activities of RMB10,641 million as a result of cash generated from operations of RMB10,740 million less income tax we paid in 2010. Our cash generated from operations was mainly due to operating profit before working capital changes of RMB13,585 million and negative changes in working capital of RMB(2,845) million. The operating profit before working capital changes of RMB13,585 million was a result of the profit before income tax of RMB5,418 million, mainly adjusted for: (i) depreciation of property, plant and equipment of RMB 6,727 million, (ii) interest expenses of RMB1,502 million, (iii) consumption of flight equipment spare parts of RMB 601.4 million, and (iv) provision for return condition checks for aircraft and engines under operating leases of RMB586.4 million, partly offset by (i) net foreign exchange gains of RMB1,075 million and (ii) gains arising from fair value movements of derivative financial instruments of RMB915 million. Negative changes in working capital mainly consisted of (i) a decrease in trade payables and notes payables of RMB3,418 million, (ii) a decrease in flight equipment and spare parts of RMB776.7 million and (iii) a decrease in provision for return condition checks for aircraft and engines under operating leases of RMB305.6 million. These negative changes were partly offset by (i) an increase in sales in advance of carriage of RMB846.5 million and (ii) an increase in other long-term liabilities of RMB569.6 million. In 2009, we generated a net cash inflow from operating activities of RMB3,429 million as a result of our cash generated from operations of RMB3,507 million less income tax we paid in 2009. Our cash generated from operations was mainly due to operating profit before working capital changes of RMB3,198 million and positive changes in working capital of RMB310 million. The operating profit before working capital changes of RMB3,198 million was a result of the profit before income tax of RMB249 million, mainly adjusted for (i) depreciation of property, plant and equipment of RMB5,177 million, (ii) interest expenses of RMB1,755 million, (iii) provision for return condition checks for aircraft and engines under operating leases of RMB588.7 million and (iv) provision for post-retirement benefits of RMB440.9 million, partly offset by unrealized gains arising from fair value movements of financial derivatives of RMB5,334 million. Positive changes in working capital mainly consisted of (i) an increase in trade payables and notes payables of RMB1,021 million, (ii) an increase in prepayments, deposits and other receivables of RMB540 million, and (iii) an increase in sales in advance of carriage of RMB406 million. These positive changes were partly offset by (i) a decrease in other payables and accrued expenses of RMB482 million, (ii) a decrease in flight equipment and spare parts of RMB466 million and (iii) a decrease in provision for return condition checks for aircraft and engines under operating leases of RMB275 million. 53 In 2008, we generated a net cash inflow from operating activities of RMB2,856 million as a result of our cash generated from operations of RMB2,942 million less income tax we paid in 2008. Our cash generated from operations was mainly due to operating profit before working capital changes of RMB112 million and positive changes in working capital of RMB2,831 million. The operating profit before working capital changes of RMB112 million was a result of the loss before income tax of RMB15,256 million, mainly adjusted for (i) loss arising from fair value movements of derivative financial instruments of RMB6,401 million, (ii) a depreciation of property, plant and equipment of RMB4,756 million, (iii) impairment loss of RMB2,977 million and (iv) interest expenses of RMB2,328 million, partly offset by net foreign exchange gains of RMB1,971 million. Positive changes in working capital mainly consisted of (i) a decrease in flight equipment spare parts of RMB529 million, (ii) an increase in other long-term liabilities of RMB432 million, (iii) a decrease in amounts due from related parties of RMB223 million, and (iv) a decrease in prepayments, deposits and other receivables of RMB217 million. These positive changes were partly offset by (i) an increase in trade payables and notes payables of RMB2,007 million, (ii) an increase in other payables and accrued expenses of RMB1,902 million, and (iii) an increase in trade receivables of RMB910 million. Cash Flows from Investing Activities In 2010, our net cash outflow from investing activities was RMB8,633 million. Our net cash outflow for investing activities mainly consisted of (i) additions of property, plant and equipment of RMB6,523 million, primarily due to the purchase of 25 aircraft in 2010, (ii) advanced payments on acquisition of new aircraft of RMB3,462 million, and (iii) payment of short-term deposits with original maturity over three months of RMB434.3 million. These cash outflows were partly offset by (i) net cash acquired through acquisition of Shanghai Airlines Co., Ltd, (ii) proceeds from disposal of non-current assets held for sale of RMB430.1 million and (iii) proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment of RMB101.9 million. In 2009, our net cash outflow from investing activities was RMB7,236 million. Our net cash outflow from investing activities mainly consisted of (i) additions of property, plant and equipment of RMB5,685 million, primarily due to the purchase of 17 new aircraft and (ii) advanced payments on acquisition of new aircraft of RMB1,927 million. These cash outflows were partly offset by (i) proceeds from disposal of interests in an associate, Joy Air, of RMB210 million and (ii) bank deposit interest received of RMB110 million. In 2008, our net cash outflow from investing activities was RMB925 million. Our net cash outflow from investing activities mainly consisted of (i) advanced payments on acquisition of aircraft of RMB3,604 million and (ii) additions of property plant and equipment of RMB1,289 million. These cash outflows were partly offset by (i) refunds of advanced payments upon deliveries of aircraft of RMB2,422 million and (ii) proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment of RMB1,856 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities In 2010, our net cash outflow from financing activities was RMB652 million. Our net cash outflow for financing activities mainly consisted of (i) repayments of short-term bank loans of RMB21,943 million, (ii) repayments of long-term bank loans of RMB6,527 million and (iii) principal repayments of financial lease obligations of RMB2,201 million. These cash outflows were partly offset by (i) proceeds from draw down of short-term bank loans of RMB20,803 million and (ii) proceeds from draw down of long-term bank loans of RMB11,556 million. In 2009, our net cash inflow from financing activities was RMB2,086 million. Our net cash inflow from financing activities mainly consisted of (i) proceeds from draw down of short-term bank loans of RMB28,537 million, (ii) proceeds from the issuance of new A and H shares of RMB14,056 million in separate placements of such shares, which were completed on December 23, 2009 and (iii) proceeds from draw down of long-term bank loans of RMB10,823 million. These cash inflows were partly offset by (i) repayments of short-term bank loans of RMB39,535 million and (ii) repayments of long-term bank loans of RMB9,522 million. Proceeds from the issuance of new shares in 2009 were used to repay a portion of our bank loans. In 2008, our net cash outflow from financing activities was RMB92 million. Our net cash outflow from financing activities mainly consisted of (i) repayments of short-term bank loans of RMB19,987 million, (ii) repayments of long-term bank loans of RMB3,923 million, (iii) interest paid of RMB2,742 million and (iv) principal repayments of finance lease obligations of RMB2,594 million. These cash outflows were partly offset by (i) proceeds from draw down of short-term bank loans of RMB25,403 million and (ii) proceeds from draw down of long-term bank loans of RMB4,748 million. 54 Working Capital and Liabilities We have, and in the future may continue to have, substantial debts. In addition, we generally operate with a working capital deficit. As of December 31, 2010, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by RMB27,184 million. In comparison, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by RMB28,648 million as of December 31, 2009. The decrease in our current liabilities in 2010 was primarily due to the decrease in the current portion of borrowings and a decrease in derivative liabilities, partially offset by an increase in the current portion provision for return condition checks for aircraft and engines under operating leases. The decrease in our current assets in 2010 was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents used to repay certain long-term liabilities. Short-term loans outstanding totaled RMB8,407 million and RMB11,193 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Long-term outstanding bank loans totaled RMB16,928 million and RMB27,373 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, our long-term debt to equity ratio was 2.9 to 1. The interest expenses associated with these debts may impair our future profitability. We expect that cash from operations and bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our operating cash flow requirements, although events that materially and adversely affect our operating results can also have a negative impact on liquidity. Our consolidated interest-bearing borrowings as of December 31, 2009 and 2010 for the purpose of calculating the indebtedness of our Company, were as follows: As of December 31 2009 2010 (RMB in millions) Secured bank loans 8,789 16,444 Unsecured bank loans 16,546 22,122 Total 25,335 38,566 The maturity profile of interest-bearing borrowings of our Company as of December 31, 2009 and 2010 was as follows: As of December 31 2009 2010 (RMB in millions) Within one year 12,330 15,211 In the second year 2,714 8,162 In the third to fifth year inclusive 6,166 8,672 After the fifth year 4,125 6,521 Total 25,335 38,566 As of December 31, 2010, our interest rates relating to short-term borrowings ranged from 1.3% to 5.3%, while our fixed interest rates on our interest-bearing borrowings for long-term bank loans ranged from 3.51% to 6.70%. Our bank loans are denominated in Renminbi, U.S. dollars and Euro. As of December 31, 2010, our total bank loans denominated in Renminbi amounted to RMB16,494 million, while our total bank loans denominated in U.S. dollars amounted to USD3,333 million. See Note 31 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our borrowings. 55 We have entered into credit facility agreements to meet our future working capital needs. However, our ability to obtain financing may be affected by: (i) our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and credit ratings; (ii) costs of financing in line with prevailing economic conditions and the status of the global financial markets; and (iii) our ability to obtain PRC government approvals required to access domestic or international financing or to undertake any project involving significant capital investment, which may include one or more approvals from the NDRC, SAFE, MOC and/or the CSRC depending on the circumstances. If we are unable to obtain financing, for whatever reason, for a significant portion of our capital requirements, our ability to acquire new aircraft and to expand our operations may be materially and adversely affected. Capital Expenditures As of December 31, 2010, according to the contracted agreements, we expect our capital expenditures for aircraft, engines and related equipment to be in aggregate approximately RMB96,263 million, including RMB16,671 million in 2011 and RMB21,733 million in 2012, in each case subject to contractually stipulated increases or any increase relating to inflation. We plan to finance our other capital commitments through a combination of funds generated from operations, existing credit facilities, bank loans, leasing arrangements and other external financing arrangements. C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc. None. D. Trend Information Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events for the period from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010 that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our net revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that caused the disclosed financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial conditions. E. Off-balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements other than our operating lease arrangements: · We have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any unconsolidated entity; · We have not entered into any obligations under any derivative contracts that are indexed to our own shares and classified as shareholder’s equity, or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements; and · We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. F. Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following tables set forth selected information regarding our outstanding contractual and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010: 56 Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1-2 Years 2-5 Years More Than 5 Years (RMB in millions) Long-Term Debt(1) 27,373 4,018 8,162 8,672 6,521 Capital Leases (2) 19,208 2,138 2,243 6,889 7,938 Operating Leases (3) 27,162 4,031 3,615 8,981 10,535 Unconditional Purchase Obligations(4) 96,263 16,671 21,733 57,859 — Other Long-term Obligations (5)(6) 1,805 — — — — Post-retirement Benefit Obligations (5) 2,617 — — — — Deferred Tax Liabilities (5) 52 — — — — Short-term Bank Loans(7) 11,193 11,193 — — — Interest Obligations 3,676 1,242 727 1,078 629 Under Finance Leases 1,666 339 297 610 420 Under Bank Loans 2,010 903 430 468 209 Fixed Rate 206 194 11 1 — Variable Rate (8) 1,804 709 419 467 209 Total 189,349 39,293 36,480 83,479 25,623 (1) Excludes interest.

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. Estimated impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets The Group tests whether property, plant and equipment and intangible assets have been impaired in accordance with the accounting policy stated in Note 2(m) to the financial statements. The recoverable amounts of cash generating units have been determined based on fair value less cost to sell and value-in-use calculations. Value-in-use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management and certain key assumptions, such as passenger-kilometers yield level, load factor, aircraft utilization rate and discount rates, etc. Fair value of non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets held for sale are stated the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell in accordance with the accounting policy stated in Note 2(n) to the financial statements. The fair value of non-current assets has been determined by reference to the estimated market value and/or available price quotes provided by the potential buyers. Revenue recognition The Group recognizes traffic revenues in accordance with the accounting policy stated in Note 2(e) to the financial statements. Unused tickets are recognized in traffic revenues based on current estimates. Management annually evaluates the balance in the SIAC and records any adjustments, which can be material, in the period the evaluation is completed. These adjustments result from differences between the estimates of certain revenue transactions and the timing of recognizing revenue for any unused air tickets and the related sales price, and are impacted by various factors, including a complex pricing structure and interline agreements throughout the industry, which affect the timing of revenue recognition. Frequent flyer programme The Group operates frequent flyer programs that provide travel awards to program members based on accumulated miles. A portion of passengers revenue attributable to the award of frequent flyer benefits is deferred and recognized when the miles have been redeemed or have expired. The deferment of revenue is estimated based on historical trends of redemptions, which is then used to project the expected utilization of these benefits, and estimated fair values of the unredeemed miles. Different judgments or estimates could significantly affect the estimated provision for frequent flyer programs and the results of operations. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment Depreciation of components related to airframe and engine overhaul costs are based on the Group’s historical experience with similar airframe and engine models and taking into account anticipated overhauls costs, timeframe between each overhaul, ratio of actual flying hours and estimated flying hours between overhauls. Different judgments or estimates could significantly affect the estimated depreciation charge and the results of operations. Except for components related to airframe and engine overhaul costs, other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, after taking into account the estimated residual value. The useful lives are based on the Group’s historical experience with similar assets and taking into account anticipated technological changes. The Group reviews the estimated useful lives of assets regularly in order to determine the amount of depreciation expense to be recorded during any reporting period. The depreciation expense for future periods is adjusted if there are significant changes from previous estimates. 58 Provision for costs of return condition checks for aircraft and engines under operating leases Provision for the estimated costs of return condition checks for aircraft and engines under operating leases is made based on the estimated costs for such return condition checks and taking into account anticipated flying hours, flying cycle and timeframe between each overhaul. These judgments or estimates are based on historical experience on returning similar airframe and engine models, actual costs incurred and aircraft and engines status. Different judgments or estimates could significantly affect the estimated provision for costs of return condition checks. Retirement benefits The Group operates and maintains defined retirement benefit plans which provide retirees with benefits including transportation subsidies, social activity subsidies as well as other welfare. The cost of providing the aforementioned benefits in the defined retirement benefit plan is actuarially determined and recognized over the employees’ service period by utilizing various actuarial assumptions and using the projected unit credit method in accordance with the accounting policy stated in Note 2(x) to the financial statements. These assumptions include, without limitation, the selection of discount rate, annual rate of increase of per capita benefit payment and employees’ turnover rate. The discount rate is based on management’s review of local high quality corporate bonds. The annual rate of increase of benefit payments is based on the general local economic conditions. The employees’ turnover rate is based on historical trends of the Group. Additional information regarding the retirement benefit plans is disclosed in Note 35 to the financial statements. Deferred income tax In assessing the amount of deferred tax assets that need to be recognized in accordance with the accounting policy stated in Note 2(j) to the financial statements, the Group considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event that the Group’s estimates of projected future taxable income and benefits from available tax strategies are changed, or changes in current tax regulations are enacted that would impact the timing or extent of the Group’s ability to utilize the tax benefits of net operating loss carry forwards in the future, adjustments to the recorded amount of net deferred tax assets and taxation expense would be made. Additional detailed information is disclosed in Note 34 to the financial statements. Valuation of acquisition price The Company issued its A shares to effect the acquisition of Shanghai Airlines during the year ended December 31, 2010 (Note 43 to the financial statements). The fair value of the shares at the acquisition date is determined based on the quoted market price of the Company’s share issued as of the date closest to the acquisition date with adjustments to reflect restrictions specific to certain shares issued. Significant assumptions were used to determine the adjustments for the value of those restricted shares. Changes to these assumptions may impact the initial recognized goodwill. Purchase price allocation for business combination Accounting for business acquisitions require the Group to allocate the cost of the acquisition to the specific assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. In connection with the acquisition of Shanghai Airlines, the Company undertakes a process to identify all assets and liabilities acquired, including any identified intangible assets where appropriate. The judgements made in identifying all acquired assets, determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as assets useful lives, may materially impact the Group’s financial position and results of operation. In determining the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, a valuation was conducted by an independent valuer and estimated fair values are based on information available near the acquisition date and on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. There are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The purchase accounting adjustment relate primarily to the aircraft and engines and land use right which is valued by using market value approach. 59 Taxation We had carried forward tax losses of approximately RMB9,855 million as of December 31, 2010, which can be used to set off against future taxable income between 2011 and 2015. Prior to 2008, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries located in Pudong District, Shanghai, were entitled to a reduced rate of 15% pursuant to the preferential tax policy in Pudong District, Shanghai. Under China’s EIT Law, which was approved by the National People’s Congress on March 16, 2007 and became effective from January 1, 2008, the Company and its Pudong subsidiaries are entitled to a transitional arrangement to gradually increase the applicable corporate income tax rate to 25% over the next five years from 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the corporate income tax rate applicable to the Company and these subsidiaries was 22%. The net deferred tax position of the Company and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 is insignificant and the change in tax rate has no material impact on our deferred tax position. Except for those subsidiaries that are incorporated in Hong Kong and therefore subject to a Hong Kong corporate income tax rate of 16.5%, other subsidiaries of the Company are generally subject to the PRC standard income tax rate of 25%. Inflation In recent years, China has not experienced significant inflation and in 2010, inflation did not have a significant effect on our business. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, China’s overall national inflation rate, as represented by the general consumer price index, decreased by approximately 0.7% in 2009 and in 2010. Although neither inflation nor deflation in the past had any material adverse impact on our results of operations, we cannot assure you that the deflation or inflation of the Chinese economy in the future would not materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

C. Interests of Experts and Counsel Not applicable. Item 8. Financial Information A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information Financial Statements You should read “Item 18. Financial Statements” for information regarding our audited consolidated financial statements and other financial information. Legal Proceedings We are involved in routine litigation and other proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe that any of these proceedings are likely to be material to our business operations, financial condition or results of operations. In 2005, the family members of certain victims in the aircraft accident (the aircraft was then owned and operated by China Eastern Air Yunnan Company), which occurred in Baotou city in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on November 21, 2004, sued, among other defendants, our Company in a U.S. court for compensation, the amount of which has not been determined. As of December 31, 2006, we had filed a motion to contest the claim in the U.S. court because we expressly did not assume the legal liability of such incident in our acquisition of certain selected assets relating to the aviation business of CEA Yunnan. In July 2007, the Superior Court of the State of California ordered the action stayed on the grounds of forum non conveniens in order to permit proceedings in the PRC. Following the plaintiffs’ appeals, in February 2009 the Court of Appeal of California affirmed the original order. On March 16, 2009, the plaintiffs sued the Company in the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People’s Court. On August 18, 2009, the Court accepted the case. Legal documents including summons, prosecution notifications and related materials have been served on the Company. Trial proceedings have not yet begun. The management of our Group believes that any outcome for this case will not have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. Save as disclosed above, we were not involved in any other new material litigation in the period of this report. 77 Dividends and Dividend Policy For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, our Board of Directors did not recommend any dividend payout due to our operating results in 2006. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, our Board of Directors also did not recommend any dividend payout due to our total accumulated losses of RMB2,814 million in the year 2007 and of RMB18,082 million in the year 2008, respectively. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, our Board of Directors also did not recommend any dividend payout due to our total accumulated losses of RMB17,913 million in the year 2009. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded total accumulated losses of RMB12,956 million. As such, the Board also did not recommend any dividend payout for the financial year ended 31 December 2010.The Directors expect the balance of accumulated losses will be carried forward to next year. We will not convert funds from the common reserve to increase our share capital during this period. Our Board declares dividends, if any, in Renminbi with respect to H Shares on a per share basis and pays such dividends in HK dollars. Any final dividend for a fiscal year is subject to shareholders' approval. BNYM, as depositary, converts the HK dollar dividend payments and distributes them to holders of ADSs in U.S. dollars, less expenses of conversion. Under the Company Law of the PRC and our Articles of Association, all of our shareholders have equal rights to dividends and distributions. The holders of the H Shares share proportionately on a per share basis in all dividends and other distributions declared by our Board, if any, based on the foreign exchange conversion rate published by the People’s Bank of China, or PBOC, on the date of the distribution of the cash dividend. We believe that our dividend policy strikes a balance between two important goals providing our shareholders with a competitive return on investment and assuring sufficient reinvestment of profits to enable us to achieve our strategic objectives. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board, which takes into account the following factors: · our financial results; · capital requirements; · contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends by us to our shareholders or by our subsidiaries to us; · our shareholders interests; · the effect on our creditworthiness; · general business and economic conditions; and · other factors our Board may deem relevant. Pursuant to PRC laws and regulations, dividends may only be distributed after allowance has been made for: (i) recovery of losses, if any and (ii) allocations to the statutory surplus reserve. The allocations to the statutory surplus reserve is 10% of our net profit determined in accordance with PRC Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Our distributable profits for the current fiscal year will be equal to our net profits determined in accordance with IFRS, less allocations to the statutory surplus reserve. B.
