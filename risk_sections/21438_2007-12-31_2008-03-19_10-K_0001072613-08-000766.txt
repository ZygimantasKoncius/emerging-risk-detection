Item 1A. Risk Factors - ---------------------- The Company operates in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that the Company cannot control or predict. The following discussion, as well as the "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" discussion in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K highlights some of these risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below before buying shares of the Company's common stock, as well as other information provided to you in this document, including information in the section of this document entitled "Forward Looking Statements". An investment in the Company's common stock is highly speculative. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company, or that the Company currently deems immaterial, may impair the Company's business operations. If any of the adverse events described in this Item 1A actually occur, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, the trading price of the Company's common stock could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment. THE COMPANY HAS A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES, AND IF THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INCUR OPERATING LOSSES, IT MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS. The Company had net losses of $7,540,000, and $5,595,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $14,416,000, and a net stockholders' deficit of $383,000 and has limited working capital as of December 31, 2007, and the Company may never be profitable. The Company has incurred losses in each of its seven most recent fiscal years. If the Company continues to incur operating losses and fails to become a profitable company, it may be unable to continue its operations. The extent of the Company's future losses and the timing of its potential profitability are highly uncertain. The Company's future growth and profitability depends solely on its ability to successfully market the VSR1000 product. The Company must continue to enhance the features and functionality of its products to meet customer requirements and competitive demands. In addition, the failure of future product enhancements to operate as expected could delay or prevent future sales of its products. If future customers do not adopt, purchase and 7 successfully deploy the Company's products and its planned product enhancements, the Company's revenues could be adversely impacted. OUR AUDITORS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, AND IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO GENERATE INCREASED BUSINESS VOLUME OR OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO CEASE OR CURTAIL ITS OPERATIONS. In their report prepared in conjunction with the Company's December 31, 2007 financial statements, the Company's auditors included an explanatory paragraph stating that, because the Company has incurred recurring net losses, has an accumulated deficit and has minimal working capital as of December 31, 2007, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS FLUCTUATE AND ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE. The Company's revenues in any particular period may be lower than revenues in a preceding or comparable period. Factors contributing to fluctuations, some of which are beyond the Company's control, include: o fluctuations in its customers' businesses; o customers' budgets and the related procurement cycles; o timing and market acceptance of new products or enhancements introduced by the Company or its competitors; o availability of components from suppliers and the manufacturing capacity of the Company's subcontractors; o timing and level of expenditures for sales, marketing and product development; o changes in the prices of the Company's or its competitors' products; and o general industry trends. In addition, the Company has historically operated with no significant backlog. Any significant deferral of orders for its products would cause a shortfall in revenues for any given fiscal period. The Company may receive one or more large orders in one quarter from a customer and then receive no orders from that customer in the succeeding quarters. As a result, the Company's revenues may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. If the Company's quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market, its stock price could be adversely impacted. THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO FUND ITS OPERATIONS. The Company may need to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing to fund operations. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had $0.4 million in cash available to fund its operations, and had working capital of $0.3 million. In 2008, it will need to raise additional capital or obtain additional debt financing in order to be able to fund its operations. The Company may not get funding when it needs it or on favorable terms. In addition, the amount of capital that a firm such as the Company is able to raise often depends on variables that are beyond its control, such as the share price of its stock and its trading volume. As a result, the Company may not be able to secure financing on terms attractive to it, or at all. If the Company is able to consummate a financing arrangement, the amount raised may not be sufficient to meet its future needs and may be highly dilutive. If the Company cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy its capital requirements, it may have to scale-back or eliminate operations. A SMALL NUMBER OF THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS ACCOUNT FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS REVENUES, AND MOST OF ITS RECEIVABLES. THE LOSS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER OR REDUCED SPENDING BY SUCH CUSTOMERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE COMPANY'S REVENUES, PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOW. A few large telecommunications, audio conferencing and cable service providers account for a substantial portion of the Company's revenues. These industries have recently experienced consolidation due to mergers and acquisitions. As service providers increase in size, it is possible that an even greater percentage of the Company's revenues will be attributable to a smaller number of customers going forward. 8 THE COMPANY HAS A HISTORY OF LOSSES, AND SUCH LOSSES MAY CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO SECURE SUFFICIENT BUSINESS TO COVER ITS OVERHEAD AND OPERATING EXPENSES. The Company has not been profitable since fiscal year 2000, and will continue to generate losses, and potentially require additional external funding, until sales of its VSR1000 products can be increased to sufficient levels for the Company to generate a profit and positive cash flow, of which there can be no assurance that such levels can be attained. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN DE-LISTED FROM THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO RAISE FUNDS. On March 18, 2008 the Company was delisted from the American Stock Exchange (the "Exchange" or "AMEX") as the Company no longer complied with the Exchange's continuing listing standards due to the Company's history of losses and the Company's inability to achieve the minimum stockholders' equity requirements. Following delisting, trading of the Company's common stock will be limited to the OTC Bulletin Board, the Pink Sheets or similar quotation systems. Inclusion of the Company's common stock on these quotation systems could adversely affect the liquidity and price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, this de-listing by the AMEX may negatively impact the Company's reputation and, as a consequence, its business. Furthermore, the Pink Sheets and OTC Bulletin Board are viewed by most investors as a less desirable, and less liquid, marketplace. As a result, an investor may find it more difficult to purchase, dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the value of ThinkEngine common stock. ThinkEngine common stock may in the future become subject to Rules 15g-1 through 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, which imposes certain sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell "penny stock" to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors" (as defined in Rule 501(c) of the Securities Act). For transactions covered by this rule, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination of the purchaser and have received the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the sale. This rule would adversely affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell the Company's common stock and purchasers of the Company's common stock to sell their shares of the Company's common stock. Penny stock includes any non-NASDAQ equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. The regulations require that prior to any non-exempt buy/sell transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule proscribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market must be delivered by a broker-dealer to the purchaser of such penny stock. This disclosure must include the amount of commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current price quotations for the Company's common stock. The regulations also require that monthly statements be sent to holders of penny stock that disclose recent price information for the penny stock and information of the limited market for penny stocks. If the Company were to become subject to these requirements, they would adversely affect the market liquidity of the Company's common stock. 9 THE COMPANY OPERATES IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES WITH MANY PARTICIPANTS. The Company operates in a highly competitive environment, competing on the basis of product offerings, technical capabilities, quality, service and pricing. Competition for next generation service providers as well as for new infrastructure deployments is particularly intense. The Company has a number of existing competitors, some of which are very large, with significantly greater technological and financial resources, brand recognition, and established relationships with the major customers in each market. In addition, new competitors may enter the industry as a result of shifts in technology. The Company does not offer any assurances that it will be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. TECHNOLOGY DRIVES THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO KEEP PACE WITH TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN ITS INDUSTRY, OR IF IT PURSUES TECHNOLOGIES THAT DO NOT BECOME COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTED, CUSTOMERS MAY NOT BUY ITS PRODUCTS OR USE ITS SERVICES. The telecommunications, conferencing and cable industries use numerous and varied technologies and large service providers often invest in several and, sometimes, incompatible technologies. These industries also demand frequent and, at times, significant technology upgrades. The Company does not have the resources to invest in all of these existing and potential technologies. As a result, the Company concentrates its resources on those technologies it believes have or will achieve substantial customer acceptance and in which it has appropriate technical expertise. However, existing products often have short product life cycles. In addition, the Company's choices for developing technologies may prove incorrect if customers do not adopt the products it develops or if those technologies ultimately prove to be unviable. The Company's operating results depend to a significant extent on the market acceptance of its products and its ability to enhance its existing products, to continue to introduce new products successfully and on a timely basis, and to develop new or enhance existing tools for its service offerings. The limited size of the Company's engineering group may severely limit the Company's ability to enhance its existing products. THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. The Company's future success is dependent on its ability to attract and retain talented personnel. There is intense competition for qualified personnel, and the Company may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development and introduction of new products or to replace qualified personnel that may leave its employ. Part of the Company's compensation program includes stock options and stock grants. If the Company's stock price continues to perform poorly it may adversely affect its ability to retain or attract key employees. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKETS FLUCTUATE AND ARE IMPACTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING DECISIONS BY SERVICE PROVIDERS REGARDING THEIR DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THEIR TIMING OF PURCHASES, AS WELL AS DEMAND AND SPENDING FOR COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES BY BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. Although the Company believes the overall market for the its audio conferencing solutions applications should grow in the future, the rate of growth could vary geographically and across different technologies and is subject to substantial fluctuations. The specific market segments in which the Company participates may not experience the growth of other segments. As a result, revenues are difficult to forecast and quarterly operating results can fluctuate significantly. THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION AND INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WHICH COULD CAUSE IT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES OR PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM SELLING ITS PRODUCTS. Intellectual property litigation can be costly and time-consuming and can divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. A successful claim by a third party of patent or other intellectual property infringement by the Company could compel it to enter into costly royalty or license agreements or force it to pay significant damages and could even require it to stop selling certain products. 10 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING MAY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S REPORTED EARNINGS AND OPERATING INCOME. U. S. generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations for many aspects of the Company's business, such as revenue recognition for software, accounting for investments, and treatment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets, are highly complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in the Company's products or business could significantly change the Company's reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures, without a comparable underlying change in cash flow from operations. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", and "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" of this report. THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO RISKS FROM RECENT LEGISLATION REQUIRING COMPANIES TO EVALUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires the Company's management to report on the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. Carlin, Charron & Rosen, LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, will be required to attest to the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting beginning with the year ended December 31, 2009. The Company believes it has established an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements. The Company expects that the cost of this program will require it to continue to incur expenses and to devote resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. It is difficult for the Company to predict how long it will take to complete management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting for each year and to remediate any deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to complete the assessment and process on a timely basis. In the event that the Company's chief executive officer, chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine that the Company's internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under Section 404, the Company cannot predict how regulators will react or how the market prices of the Company's shares will be affected. ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. The Company may make acquisitions or enter into joint ventures as part of its long-term business strategy. Any such transaction involves significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance the Company's business strategy, that the Company doesn't realize a satisfactory return on the investment it makes, or that the Company may experience difficulty in the integration of new employees, business systems, and technology, or diversion of management's attention from its other business activities. These factors could adversely affect the Company's operating results or financial condition. THE COMPANY RELIES ON THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS TO PRODUCE SUBASSEMBLIES AND CERTAIN FINISHED PRODUCTS. The Company outsources the production of certain subassemblies and finished goods. If a contract manufacturer terminates its relationship with the Company or is unable to fill the Company's orders on a timely basis, or if the Company does not accurately forecast its requirements, the Company may be unable to deliver the affected products to meet its customers' orders, which may adversely impact our revenue and operating results in a quarter. 11 Item 1.B Unresolved Staff Comments - ------------------------------------ None.
