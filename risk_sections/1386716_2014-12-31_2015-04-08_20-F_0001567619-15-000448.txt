Key Information Throughout this report, the Company, Star Bulk, we, us and our all refer to Star Bulk Carriers Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. We use the term deadweight ton (dwt) in describing the size of vessels. Dwt, expressed in metric tons, each of which is equivalent to 1,000 kilograms, refers to the maximum weight of cargo and supplies that a vessel can carry. We own, operate, have under construction and provide vessel management services to dry bulk vessels of eight sizes: 1. Newcastlemax, which are vessels with carrying capacities of between 200,000 dwt and 210,000 dwt; 2. Capesize, which are vessels with carrying capacities of between 100,000 dwt and 200,000 dwt; 3. Post Panamax, which are vessels with carrying capacities of between 90,000 dwt and 100,000 dwt; 4. Kamsarmax, which are vessels with carrying capacities of between 80,000 dwt and 90,000 dwt; 5. Panamax, which are vessels with carrying capacities of between 65,000 and 80,000 dwt; 6. Ultramax, which are vessels with carrying capacities of between 60,000 and 65,000 dwt; 7. Supramax, which are vessels with carrying capacities of between 50,000 and 60,000 dwt; and 8. Handymax, which are vessels with carrying capacities of between 40,000 and 50,000 dwt. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to Dollars and $ in this report are to U.S. Dollars and all references to Euro and € in this report are to Euros. On July 11, 2014, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended from time to time, the Merger Agreement), dated as of June 16, 2014, among Star Bulk, two of our merger subsidiaries, Oaktree OBC Holdings LLC (the Oaktree Holdco), Millennia Limited Liability Company (the Pappas Holdco), Oaktree Dry Bulk Holdings LLC (the Oaktree Seller) and Millennia Holdings LLC (the Pappas Seller and, together with the Oaktree Seller, the Sellers), the parties thereto completed a transaction that resulted in a merger (the Merger) of the Oaktree Holdco and the Pappas Holdco into our two merger subsidiaries. The Oaktree Holdco and the Pappas Holdco were the equity holders of Oceanbulk Shipping LLC (Oceanbulk Shipping) and Oceanbulk Carriers LLC (Oceanbulk Carriers and, together with Oceanbulk Shipping, Oceanbulk). Oceanbulk owned and operated a fleet of 12 dry bulk carrier vessels and owned contracts for the construction of 25 newbuilding dry bulk fuel-efficient Eco-type vessels (seven of which, Peloreus, Leviathan, Honey Badger, Wolverine, Idee Fixe, Roberta and Gargantua have been delivered to us) at shipyards in Japan and China. The consideration paid by us in the Merger to the Sellers was 48,395,766 common shares. The Merger Agreement also provided for the acquisition (the Heron Transaction) by us of two Kamsarmax vessels (the Heron Vessels), from Heron Ventures Ltd. (Heron), a limited liability company incorporated in Malta. We issued 2,115,706 of our common shares into escrow as consideration for the Heron Vessels. In January 2015, the common shares were released from escrow to the Sellers under the Merger Agreement, following the transfer of the Heron Vessels to us in December 2014. In addition to the issued shares, in November 2014, we entered into a loan agreement with CiT Finance LLC for $25.3 million, to finance the cash consideration related to the acquisition of the Heron Vessels. In addition, concurrently with the Merger, we completed a transaction (the Pappas Transaction), in which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Dioriga Shipping Co. and Positive Shipping Company (collectively, the Pappas Companies), which were entities owned and controlled by affiliates of the family of Mr. Petros Pappas, our Chief Executive Officer. The Pappas Companies owned and operated a dry bulk carrier vessel (the Tsu Ebisu) and had a contract for the construction of a newbuilding dry bulk carrier vessel, Indomitable (ex-HN 5016), which was delivered to us in January 2015. The consideration paid by us in the Pappas Transaction was 3,592,728 common shares. We refer to the Merger, the Heron Transaction and the Pappas Transaction collectively as the July 2014 Transactions. In connection with the July 2014 Transactions, we increased the number of directors constituting our board of directors to nine and, following the resignation of Ms. Milena-Maria Pappas as a director, appointed Mr. Rajath Shourie, Ms. Emily Stephens, Ms. Renée Kemp and Mr. Stelios Zavvos as additional directors. In connection with the July 2014 Transactions, Mr. Petros Pappas became our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Hamish Norton became our President, Mr. Christos Begleris became our Co-Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Nicos Rescos became our Chief Operating Officer and Ms. Sophia Damigou became our Co-General Counsel. Mr. Spyros Capralos resigned as our Chief Executive Officer but will remain with us as our Chairman, and Mr. Zenon Kleopas (our former Chief Operating Officer) will continue as our Executive Vice President—Technical Operations. In connection with the July 2014 Transactions, we entered into a shareholders agreement with Oaktree and a shareholders agreement with Mr. Petros Pappas and his children, Ms. Milena-Maria Pappas (our former director) and Mr. Alexandros Pappas, and entities affiliated to them (Pappas Shareholders) (see Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions.). We also entered into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement among us, the Oaktree Seller, the Pappas Shareholders, the Pappas Seller, Monarch and certain affiliates thereof (the Registration Rights Agreement). For more information regarding the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, see Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions. On August 19, 2014, we entered into definitive agreements with Excel Maritime Carriers Ltd. (Excel) pursuant to which we acquired 34 operating dry bulk vessels, consisting of six Capesize vessels, 14 Kamsarmax vessels, 12 Panamax vessels and two Handymax vessels (the Excel Vessels). In the case of three Excel Vessels (Christine (tbr Star Martha), Sandra (tbr Star Pauline) and Lowlands Beilun (tbr Star Despoina)) which were transferred subject to existing charters, we received the outstanding equity interests of the vessel-owning subsidiaries that own those Excel Vessels (although all other assets and liabilities of such vessel-owning subsidiaries remained with Excel). The transfers of the Excel Vessels were completed on a vessel-by-vessel basis, in general upon reaching port after their voyages and cargoes were discharged. We refer to the foregoing transactions, together, as the Excel Transactions. The total consideration for the Excel Transactions was 29,917,312 common shares (the Excel Vessel Share Consideration) and $288.4 million in cash. On August 28, 2014, the Registration Rights Agreement was amended in conjunction with the Excel Transactions. For more information regarding the terms of this amendment to the Registration Rights Agreement, see Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions. We refer to the July 2014 Transactions and the Excel Transactions collectively, as the Transactions. In connection with the Transactions, we entered into, amended or assumed a number of credit facilities. See Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects – B. Liquidity and Capital Resources – Senior Secured Credit Facilities. 2 On November 6, 2014, we issued $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes). The 2019 Notes mature in November 2019 and are senior, unsecured obligations of Star Bulk Carriers Corp. See Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects – B. Liquidity and Capital Resources – 2019 Notes Offering. On January 14, 2015, we completed a primary underwritten public offering of 49,000,418 of our common shares, at a price of $5.00 per share (the 2015 Equity Offering). The aggregate proceeds to us, net of underwriters commissions, were approximately $242.2 million, which we intend to use for our newbuilding program and general corporate purposes. Four of our significant shareholders, Oaktree Capital Management L.P. (Oaktree), Angelo, Gordon & Co. (Angelo, Gordon), Monarch Alternative Capital LP (Monarch), and affiliates of the family of Mr. Petros Pappas, our Chief Executive Officer, purchased a total of 37,250,418 of the common shares in the 2015 Equity Offering. See Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects – B. Liquidity and Capital Resources – 2015 Equity Offering. Oaktree Oaktree is our largest shareholder. Oaktree Capital Management, L.P., together with its affiliates, is a leader among global investment managers specializing in alternative investments, with $90.8 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2014. The firm emphasizes an opportunistic, value-oriented and risk-controlled approach to investments in distressed debt, corporate debt (including high yield debt and senior loans), control investing, convertible securities, real estate and listed equities. Headquartered in Los Angeles, the firm has over 900 employees and offices in 17 cities across 12 countries. See Item 7 Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions for a discussion on the various limitations on the transfer and voting of our common shares by Oaktree. A.

(2) Ownership days are the total number of calendar days all vessels in our fleet were owned by us for the relevant period. (3) Available days for the fleet are equal to the ownership days minus off-hire days as a result of major repairs, dry docking or special or intermediate surveys. (4) Voyage days are equal to the total number of days the vessels were in our possession for the relevant period minus off-hire days incurred for any reason (including off-hire for dry docking, major repairs, special or intermediate surveys or transfer of ownership). (5) Fleet utilization is calculated by dividing voyage days by available days for the relevant period. (6) Time charter equivalent rate (the TCE rate) represents the weighted average per day TCE rates of our entire fleet. TCE rate is a measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel on a per voyage basis. Our method of calculating TCE rate is determined by dividing voyage revenues (net of voyage expenses and amortization of fair value of above or below market acquired time charter agreements) by voyage days for the relevant time period. Voyage expenses primarily consist of port, canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage, which would otherwise be paid by the charterer under a time charter contract, as well as commissions. TCE rate is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping companys performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods. We report TCE revenues, a non-GAAP measure, since our management believes it provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with voyage revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, because it assists our management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of our vessels and in evaluating their financial performance. Our calculation of TCE may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. For further information concerning our calculation of TCE rate and of reconciliation of TCE rate to voyage revenue, please see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects – A. Operating Results. (7) Average per day operating expenses per vessel are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by ownership days. (8) Average per day management fees per vessel are calculated by dividing vessel management fees by ownership days. (9) Average per day general and administrative expenses per vessel are calculated by dividing general and administrative expenses by total ownership days for fleet. B. Capitalization and Indebtedness Not Applicable. C. Reasons for the Offer and Use of Proceeds Not Applicable. 6 D. Risk factors The following risks relate principally to the industry in which we operate and our business in general. Other risks relate principally to the securities market and ownership of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the events described in this section could significantly and negatively affect our business, financial condition operating results or cash available for dividends or the trading price of our common stock. Risks Related to Our Industry Charterhire rates for dry bulk vessels are volatile and have declined significantly since their historic highs and may remain at low levels or further decrease in the future, which may adversely affect our earnings, revenue and profitability and our ability to comply with our loan covenants. The dry bulk shipping industry is cyclical with high volatility in charterhire rates and profitability. The degree of charterhire rate volatility among different types of dry bulk vessels has varied widely; however, the continued downturn in the dry bulk charter market has severely affected the entire dry bulk shipping industry and charterhire rates for dry bulk vessels have declined significantly from historically high levels. In the past, time charter and spot market charter rates for dry bulk carriers have declined below operating costs of vessels. The BDI, a daily average of charter rates for key dry bulk routes published by the Baltic Exchange Limited, which has long been viewed as the main benchmark to monitor the movements of the dry bulk vessel charter market and the performance of the entire dry bulk shipping market, declined 94% in 2008 from a peak of 11,793 in May 2008 to a low of 663 in December 2008 and has remained volatile since then. The BDI recorded a record low of 647 in February 2012. The BDI then increased from these low levels, reaching 2,337 in December 2013. Subsequently, due to downward volatility, the BDI fluctuated in a range between 698 and 2,337 from December 2013 through December 2014. The BDI has ranged from 509 to 771 from January until March 2015, and the dry bulk market remains volatile. Fluctuations in charter rates result from changes in the supply of and demand for vessel capacity and changes in the supply of and demand for the major commodities carried by water internationally. Because the factors affecting the supply of and demand for vessels are outside of our control and are unpredictable, the nature, timing, direction and degree of changes in industry conditions are also unpredictable. Since we charter our vessels principally in the spot market, we are exposed to the cyclicality and volatility of the spot market. Spot market charterhire rates may fluctuate significantly based upon available charters and the supply of and demand for seaborne shipping capacity, and we may be unable to keep our vessels fully employed in these short-term markets. Alternatively, charter rates available in the spot market may be insufficient to enable our vessels to operate profitably. A significant decrease in charter rates would also affect asset values and adversely affect our profitability, cash flows and our ability to pay dividends, if any. Factors that influence the demand for dry bulk vessel capacity include: • supply of and demand for energy resources, commodities, consumer and industrial products; • changes in the exploration or production of energy resources, commodities, consumer and industrial products; • the location of regional and global exploration, production and manufacturing facilities; • the location of consuming regions for energy resources, commodities, consumer and industrial products; • the globalization of production and manufacturing; • global and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts and terrorist activities, embargoes and strikes; 7 • natural disasters; • disruptions and developments in international trade; • changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including the distance cargo is transported by sea; • environmental and other regulatory developments; • currency exchange rates; and • weather. Factors that influence the supply of dry bulk vessel capacity include: • the number of newbuilding orders and deliveries including slippage in deliveries; • number of shipyards and ability of shipyards to deliver vessels; • port and canal congestion; • the scrapping rate of vessels; • speed of vessel operation; • vessel casualties; and • the number of vessels that are out of service, namely those that are laid-up, dry docked, awaiting repairs or otherwise not available for hire. In addition to the prevailing and anticipated freight rates, factors that affect the rate of newbuilding, scrapping and laying-up include newbuilding prices, secondhand vessel values in relation to scrap prices, costs of bunkers and other operating costs, costs associated with classification society surveys, normal maintenance costs, insurance coverage costs, the efficiency and age profile of the existing dry bulk fleet in the market, and government and industry regulation of maritime transportation practices, particularly environmental protection laws and regulations. These factors influencing the supply of and demand for shipping capacity are outside of our control, and we may not be able to correctly assess the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions. We anticipate that the future demand for our dry bulk vessels will be dependent upon economic growth in the worlds economies, including China and India, seasonal and regional changes in demand, changes in the capacity of the global dry bulk fleet, including vessel scrapping and ordering rates of newbuildings, and the sources and supply of dry bulk cargo to be transported by sea. Given the number of new dry bulk carriers currently on order with the shipyards, the capacity of global dry bulk carrier fleet seems likely to increase and there can be no assurance as to the timing or extent of future economic growth. Adverse economic, political, social or other developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. 8 Global economic conditions may continue to negatively impact the dry bulk shipping industry. In the current global economy, operating businesses have recently faced tightening credit, weakening demand for goods and services, weak international liquidity conditions, and declining markets. Lower demand for dry bulk cargoes as well as diminished trade credit available for the delivery of such cargoes have led to decreased demand for dry bulk carriers, creating downward pressure on charter rates and vessel values. The relatively weak global economic conditions have and may continue to have a number of adverse consequences for dry bulk and other shipping sectors, including, among other things: • low charter rates, particularly for vessels employed on short-term time charters or in the spot market; • decreases in the market value of dry bulk vessels and limited secondhand market for the sale of vessels; • limited financing for vessels; • widespread loan covenant defaults; and • declaration of bankruptcy by certain vessel operators, vessel owners, shipyards and charterers. • The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The current state of global financial markets and current economic conditions may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing or refinance our existing and future credit facilities on acceptable terms, which may hinder or prevent us from operating or expanding our business. Global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile. These issues, along with significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk and the current weak economic conditions, have made, and will likely continue to make, it difficult to obtain additional financing. The current state of global financial markets and current economic conditions might adversely impact our ability to issue additional equity at prices that will not be dilutive to our existing shareholders or preclude us from issuing equity at all. Also, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets has increased as many lenders have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at all or on terms similar to current debt and reduced, and in some cases ceased, to provide funding to borrowers. Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that financing will be available to the extent required, or that we will be able to refinance our existing and future credit facilities, on acceptable terms or at all. If financing or refinancing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to enhance our existing business, complete the acquisition of our newbuildings and additional vessel acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. Many of our vessels will soon be exposed to the volatilities of the dry bulk charter markets. Dry bulk charter markets experienced significant continued weakness in 2013 and 2014. As of April 6, 2015, we had 59 vessels employed in the spot market, under short-term time charters or voyage charters and nine vessels on medium to long-term time charters scheduled to expire from August 2015 until August 2016. The time charter market is highly competitive and spot and short-term trip charter market charterhire rates (which affect time charter rates) may fluctuate significantly based upon the supply of, and demand for, seaborne dry bulk shipping capacity. Our ability to re-charter our vessels on the expiration or termination of their current time charters and the charter rates payable under any renewal or replacement charters will depend upon, among other things, economic conditions in the dry bulk shipping market. The dry bulk carrier charter market is volatile, and in the past, time charter and spot market charter rates for dry bulk carriers have declined below operating costs of vessels. If we are required to charter these vessels at a time when demand and charter rates are very low, we may not be able to secure time charter or spot market employment for our vessels at all or at reduced and potentially unprofitable rates. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future, and compliance with covenants in our credit facilities, may be affected. 9 The instability of the euro or the inability of countries to refinance their debts could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability and financial position. As a result of the credit crisis in Europe, in particular in Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, the European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility (the EFSF), and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (the EFSM), to provide funding to Eurozone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. In March 2011, the European Council agreed on the need for Eurozone countries to establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism, which was established on September 27, 2012 to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Eurozone countries. Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations and the overall stability of the euro. An extended period of adverse developments in the outlook for European countries could reduce the overall demand for dry bulk cargoes and for our services. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flow. If economic conditions throughout the world do not improve, it may negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and may adversely affect the market price of our common shares. Negative trends in the global economy that emerged in 2008 continue to adversely affect global economic conditions. In addition, the world economy is currently facing a number of new challenges, recent turmoil and hostilities in various regions, including Syria, Iraq, North Korea, North Africa and Ukraine. The weakness in the global economy has caused, and may continue to cause, a decrease in worldwide demand for certain goods and, thus, shipping. Continuing economic instability could have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our business strategy. The United States, the European Union and other parts of the world have recently been or are currently in a recession and continue to exhibit weak economic trends. The credit markets in the United States and Europe have experienced significant contraction, deleveraging and reduced liquidity, and the U.S. federal and state governments and European authorities have implemented and are considering a broad variety of governmental action and/or new regulation of the financial markets and may implement additional regulations in the future. Securities and futures markets and the credit markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations and other requirements. The SEC, other regulators, self-regulatory organizations and exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of market emergencies, and may effect changes in law or interpretations of existing laws. Global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and continue to be volatile. Credit markets and the debt and equity capital markets have been distressed and the uncertainty surrounding the future of the global credit markets has resulted in reduced access to credit worldwide. We face risks attendant to changes in economic environments, changes in interest rates, and instability in the banking and securities markets around the world, among other factors. Major market disruptions and the current adverse changes in market conditions and regulatory climate in the United States and worldwide may adversely affect our business or impair our ability to borrow amounts under credit facilities or any future financial arrangements. The recent and developing economic and governmental factors, together with possible further declines in charter rates and vessel values, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, or the trading price of our common shares. 10 Continued economic slowdown in the Asia Pacific region, particularly in China, may exacerbate the effect on us, as we anticipate a significant number of the port calls made by our vessels will continue to involve the loading or discharging of dry bulk commodities in ports in the Asia Pacific region. Before the global economic financial crisis that began in 2008, China had one of the worlds fastest growing economies in terms of GDP, which had a significant impact on shipping demand. The growth rate of Chinas GDP is estimated to have decreased to approximately 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014, which is Chinas lowest growth rate for the past five years, and continues to remain below pre-2008 levels. China has recently imposed measures to restrain lending, which may further contribute to a slowdown in its economic growth, while it has announced plans to gradually transition from an investment led growth model to a consumption driven economic growth model, which could lead to smaller demand for iron ore and other commodities. This transition may take place over the span of a number of years, and there can be no assurance as to the time frame for such a transformation or that any such transformation will occur at all. It is possible that China and other countries in the Asia Pacific region will continue to experience slowed or even negative economic growth in the near future. Moreover, the current economic slowdown in the economies of the United States, the European Union and other Asian countries may further adversely affect economic growth in China and elsewhere. Our business, financial condition and results of operations, ability to pay dividends, if any, as well as our future prospects, will likely be materially and adversely affected by a further economic downturn in any of these countries. Changes in the economic and political environment in China and policies adopted by the government to regulate its economy may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of western countries in such respects as structure, government involvement, level of development, growth rate, capital reinvestment, allocation of resources, bank regulation, currency and monetary policy, rate of inflation and balance of payments position. Prior to 1978, the Chinese economy was a planned economy. Since 1978, increasing emphasis has been placed on the utilization of market forces in the development of the Chinese economy. Annual and five year State Plans are adopted by the Chinese government in connection with the development of the economy. Although state-owned enterprises still account for a substantial portion of the Chinese industrial output, in general, the Chinese government is reducing the level of direct control that it exercises over the economy through State Plans and other measures. There is an increasing level of freedom and autonomy in areas such as allocation of resources, production, pricing and management and a gradual shift in emphasis to a market economy and enterprise reform. Limited price reforms were undertaken with the result that prices for certain commodities are principally determined by market forces. In addition, economic reforms may include reforms to the banking and credit sector and may produce a shift away from the export-driven growth model that has characterized the Chinese economy over the past few decades. Many of the reforms are unprecedented or experimental and may be subject to revision, change or abolition based upon the outcome of such experiments. The level of imports to and exports from China could be adversely affected by the failure to continue market reforms or changes to existing pro-export economic policies. The level of imports to and exports from China may also be adversely affected by changes in political, economic and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Chinese government, such as changes in laws, regulations or export and import restrictions, internal political instability, changes in currency policies, changes in trade policies and territorial or trade disputes. A decrease in the level of imports to and exports from China could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We conduct a substantial amount of business in China. The legal system in China has inherent uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes and their legal interpretation by the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, the Chinese government has been developing a comprehensive system of commercial laws, and considerable progress has been made in introducing laws and regulations dealing with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade. However, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, there is a general lack of internal guidelines or authoritative interpretive guidance and because of the limited number of published cases and their non-binding nature, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. We conduct a substantial portion of our business in China or with Chinese counter parties. For example, we enter into charters with Chinese customers, which charters may be subject to new regulations in China. We may, therefore, be required to incur new or additional compliance or other administrative costs, and pay new taxes or other fees to the Chinese government. In addition, a number of our newbuilding vessels are being built at Chinese shipyards. Changes in laws and regulations, including with regards to tax matters, and their implementation by local authorities could affect our vessels that are either chartered to Chinese customers or that call to Chinese ports and our vessels being built at Chinese shipyards, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends. 11 The market values of our vessels have declined and may further decline, which could limit the amount of funds that we can borrow, cause us to breach certain financial covenants in our credit facilities (including ship financing facilities) or result in an impairment charge, and we may incur a loss if we sell vessels following a decline in their market value. The fair market values of dry bulk vessels have generally experienced high volatility and have recently declined significantly. The fair market value of our vessels may continue to fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including: • prevailing level of charter rates; • general economic and market conditions affecting the shipping industry; • types, sizes and ages of vessels; • supply of and demand for vessels; • other modes of transportation; • cost of newbuildings; • governmental or other regulations; • the need to upgrade vessels as a result of charterer requirements, technological advances in vessel design or equipment or otherwise; • technological advances; and • competition from other shipping companies and other modes of transportation. If the fair market value of our vessels declines, we might not be in compliance with various covenants in our ship financing facilities, some of which require the maintenance of a certain percentage of fair market value of the vessels securing the facility to the principal outstanding amount of the loans under the facility or a maximum ratio of total liabilities to market value of adjusted total assets. Under such circumstances, the amount of funds we may draw down under our credit facilities may be limited, and an event of default could result. In such circumstances, we may not be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. If we are not able to comply with the covenants in our credit facilities and are unable to remedy the relevant breach, our lenders could accelerate our debt and foreclose on our vessels, or the funds required to pay for a vessel may not be available at the time the payments are due to the shipbuilder or seller. Furthermore, if vessel values decline, we may have to record an impairment charge in our consolidated financial statements, which could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, if we sell one or more of our vessels at a time when vessel prices have fallen and before we have recorded an impairment adjustment to our consolidated financial statements, the sale proceeds may be less than the vessels carrying value on our consolidated financial statements, resulting in a loss and a reduction in earnings. Conversely, if vessel values are elevated at a time when we wish to acquire additional vessels, the cost of such acquisitions may increase and this could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. 12 Compliance with safety and other vessel requirements imposed by classification societies may be very costly and may adversely affect our business. The vast majority of commercial vessels are built to safety and other vessel requirements established by private classification, or class, societies such as the American Bureau of Shipping. The class society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with its standards and regulations, which is an element of compliance with the Safety of Life at Sea Convention known as SOLAS, and, where so engaged, the applicable conventions, rules and regulations adopted by the country of registry of the vessel. Every classed vessel is subject to a specific program of periodic class surveys consisting of annual surveys, an intermediate survey and a class renewal or special survey normally every five years. Surveys become more intensive as the vessel ages. In lieu of a special survey, a vessels machinery may be on a continuous survey cycle under which the machinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. Every vessel is also required to be taken out of the water in a dry dock every two and a half to five years for inspection of its underwater parts. Compliance with class society recommendations and requirements may result in significant expense. If any vessel does not maintain its class or fails any annual, intermediate or special survey, the vessel will be unable to trade between ports and will be unemployable and uninsurable until such failures are remedied, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental regulations, that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. Our operations are subject to numerous international, national, state and local laws, regulations, treaties and conventions in force in international waters and the jurisdictions in which our vessels operate or are registered, which can significantly affect the ownership and operation of our vessels. These laws and other legal requirements include, but are not limited to, the U.S. Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the OPA), the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, the U.S. Clean Air Act, the U.S. Clean Water Act, the U.S. Ocean Dumping Act, 1972, the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 and international conventions issued under the auspices of the United Nations International Maritime Organization including the International Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972 as modified by the 1996 London Protocol, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 as modified by the Protocol of 1978, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, and the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966. Compliance with such laws and other legal requirements may require vessels to be altered, costly equipment to be installed or operational changes to be implemented and may decrease the resale value or reduce the useful lives of our vessels. Such compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A failure to comply with applicable laws and other legal requirements may result in administrative and civil monetary fines and penalties, additional compliance plans or programs or other ongoing increased compliance costs, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations. Because such laws and other legal requirements are often revised, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with them or their impact on the resale prices or useful lives of our vessels. Additional conventions, laws and regulations or other legal requirements may be adopted which could limit our ability to do business or increase the cost of our doing business and which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Environmental laws often impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances, which could subject us to liability without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault. Under OPA, for example, owners, operators and bareboat charterers are jointly and severally strictly liable for the discharge of oil within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone around the United States. Furthermore, environmental, safety, manning and other laws and legal requirements have become more stringent and impose greater costs on vessels after significant vessel related accidents like the grounding of the Exxon Valdez in 1989 and the explosion and oil spill in 2010 with respect to the Deepwater Horizon offshore oil drilling rig. Similar unpredictable events may result in further regulation of the shipping industry as well as modifications to statutory liability schemes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. An oil spill caused by one of our vessels or attributed to one of our vessels could result in significant company liability, including fines, penalties and criminal liability and remediation costs for natural resource and other damages under a variety of laws and legal requirements, as well as third-party damages. 13 We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses, and certificates with respect to our operations and to satisfy insurance and financial responsibility requirements for potential oil (including marine fuel) spills and other pollution incidents. Any such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all such liabilities and it may be difficult to obtain adequate coverage on acceptable terms in certain market conditions. Claims against our vessels whether covered by insurance or not may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future. In order to comply with emerging ballast water treatment requirements, we may have to purchase expensive ballast water treatment systems and modify our vessels to accommodate such systems. Many countries already regulate the discharge of ballast water carried by vessels from country to country to prevent the introduction of invasive harmful species via such discharges. The United States, for example, requires vessels entering its waters from another country to conduct mid-ocean ballast exchange, or undertake some alternative measure, and to comply with certain reporting requirements. The International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments (the BWM Convention), adopted by the UN International Maritime Organization in February 2004, calls for the phased introduction of mandatory reducing living organism limits in ballast water over time. Although the BWM Convention has not yet entered into force and has not been ratified by the United States, the United States Coast Guard has adopted regulations imposing requirements similar to those of the BWM Convention. In order to comply with these living organism limits, vessel owners may have to install expensive ballast water treatment systems or make port facility disposal arrangements and modify existing vessels to accommodate those systems. To date, many of these systems are unproven and not yet certified for use by any government. We cannot predict whether the BWM Convention will be sufficiently ratified to enter into force or whether other countries will adopt it or similar requirements unilaterally. Adoption of the BWM Convention standards could have an adverse material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations depending on the available ballast water treatment systems and the extent to which existing vessels must be modified to accommodate such systems. An over-supply of dry bulk carrier capacity in recent years may prolong or further depress the current low charter rates, which may limit our ability to operate our dry bulk carriers profitably. The supply of dry bulk vessels has increased significantly since the beginning of 2006. As of the beginning of February 2015, the order book for newbuilding vessels stood at approximately 20.5% of the existing global fleet capacity excluding conversion and cancellations. Vessel supply has increased more than vessel demand in recent years, causing downward pressure on charter rates during that time. If supply is not fully absorbed by the market, charter rates may continue to be under pressure due to vessel supply. Since our fleet will continue to be mostly employed in voyage charters and short-term time charters, we remain exposed to the spot market. World events could affect our results of operations and financial condition. Past terrorist attacks, as well as the threat of future terrorist attacks around the world, continue to cause uncertainty in the worlds financial markets and may affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Continuing conflicts, instability and other recent developments in the Ukraine, the Korean Peninsula, the East China Sea, the Middle East, including Iraq, Syria, Egypt, West Africa and North Africa, and the presence of U.S. or other armed forces in the Middle East, may lead to additional acts of terrorism and armed conflict around the world, which may contribute to further economic instability in the global financial markets. The epidemic of the Ebola virus disease, which is ongoing in West Africa, may lead to crew member illness, which can disrupt the operations of our vessels, or to public health measures, which may prevent our vessels from calling on ports or discharging cargo in the affected areas or in other locations after having visited the affected areas. These uncertainties could also adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In the past, political conflicts have also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. Acts of terrorism and piracy have also affected vessels trading in regions such as the South China Sea and the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia. In November 2013, the government of the Peoples Republic of China announced an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), covering much of the East China Sea. When introduced, the Chinese ADIZ was controversial because a number of nations are not honoring the ADIZ, and the ADIZ includes certain maritime areas that have been contested among various nations in the region. Tensions relating to the Chinese ADIZ may escalate as a result of incidents relating to the ADIZ or other territorial disputes, which may result in additional limitations on navigation or trade. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 14 Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business. Acts of piracy have historically affected ocean-going vessels trading in regions of the world such as the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean and in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia. Although the frequency of sea piracy worldwide decreased during 2012 and 2013 to its lowest level since 2009, sea piracy incidents continue to occur, particularly in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia and increasingly in the Gulf of Guinea and the West Coast of Africa, with dry bulk vessels particularly vulnerable to such attacks. If these piracy attacks result in regions in which our vessels are deployed being characterized as war risk zones by insurers, as the Gulf of Aden temporarily was in May 2008, or Joint War Committee war and strikes listed areas, premiums payable for such coverage could increase significantly and such insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain. In addition, crew costs, including those due to employing onboard security guards, could increase in such circumstances. Furthermore, while we believe the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, the charterer may dispute this and withhold charterhire until the vessel is released. A charterer may also claim that a vessel seized by pirates was not on-hire for a certain number of days and is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party, a claim that we would dispute. We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, any detention hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against our vessels, or an increase in cost, or unavailability, of insurance for our vessels, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. We could face penalties under European Union, United States or other economic sanctions which could adversely affect our reputation, our financial results and the market for our common shares. Our business could be adversely impacted if we are found to have violated economic sanctions under the applicable laws of the European Union, the United States or another applicable jurisdiction against countries such as Iran, Sudan, Syria, North Korea and Cuba. U.S. economic sanctions, for example, prohibit a wide scope of conduct, target numerous countries and individuals, are frequently updated or changed and have vague application in many situations. Many economic sanctions relate to our business, including prohibitions on certain kinds of trade with countries, such as exportation or re-exportation of commodities, or prohibitions against certain transactions with designated nationals who may be operating under aliases or through non-designated companies. The imposition of Ukrainian-related economic sanctions on Russian persons, first imposed in March 2014, is an example of economic sanctions with a potentially widespread and unpredictable impact on shipping. Certain of our charterers or other parties that we have entered into contracts with regarding our vessels may be affiliated with persons or entities that are the subject of sanctions imposed by the Obama administration, and European Union and/or other international bodies as a result of the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014. If we determine that such sanctions require us to terminate existing contracts or if we are found to be in violation of such applicable sanctions, our results of operations may be adversely affected or we may suffer reputational harm. Additionally, the U.S. Iran Threat Reduction Act (which was signed into law in 2012) amended the Exchange Act to require issuers that file annual or quarterly reports under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act to include disclosure in their annual and quarterly reports as to whether the issuer or its affiliates have knowingly engaged in certain activities prohibited by sanctions against Iran or transactions or dealings with certain identified persons. We are subject to this disclosure requirement. Although we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations and intend to maintain such compliance, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. Any such violation could result in fines or other penalties and could severely impact our ability to access U.S. capital markets and conduct our business, and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in us. Even inadvertent violations of economic sanctions can result in the imposition of material fines and restrictions and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, our reputation, and the market price of our common shares. 15 Our vessels may call on ports subject to economic sanctions or embargoes that could adversely affect our reputation and the market for our common shares. From time to time on charterers instructions, our vessels may call on ports located in countries subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the United States government and countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism, such as Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria. The U.S. sanctions and embargo laws and regulations vary in their application, as they do not all apply to the same covered persons or proscribe the same activities, and such sanctions and embargo laws and regulations may be amended or strengthened over time. With effect from July 1, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability and Divestment Act, or CISADA, which expanded the scope of the Iran Sanctions Act. Among other things, CISADA expands the application of the prohibitions to companies, such as ours, and introduces limits on the ability of companies and persons to do business or trade with Iran when such activities relate to the investment, supply or export of refined petroleum or petroleum products. In addition, on May 1, 2012, President Obama signed Executive Order 13608 which prohibits foreign persons from violating or attempting to violate, or causing a violation of any sanctions in effect against Iran or facilitating any deceptive transactions for or on behalf of any person subject to U.S. sanctions. Any persons found to be in violation of Executive Order 13608 will be deemed a foreign sanctions evader and will be banned from all contacts with the United States, including conducting business in U.S. dollars. Also in 2012, President Obama signed into law the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, or the Iran Threat Reduction Act, which created new sanctions and strengthened existing sanctions. Among other things, the Iran Threat Reduction Act intensifies existing sanctions regarding the provision of goods, services, infrastructure or technology to Irans petroleum or petrochemical sector. The Iran Threat Reduction Act also includes a provision requiring the President of the United States to impose five or more sanctions from Section 6(a) of the Iran Sanctions Act, as amended, on a person the President determines is a controlling beneficial owner of, or otherwise owns, operates, or controls or insures a vessel that was used to transport crude oil from Iran to another country and (1) if the person is a controlling beneficial owner of the vessel, the person had actual knowledge the vessel was so used or (2) if the person otherwise owns, operates, or controls, or insures the vessel, the person knew or should have known the vessel was so used. Such a person could be subject to a variety of sanctions, including exclusion from U.S. capital markets, exclusion from financial transactions subject to U.S. jurisdiction, and exclusion of that persons vessels from U.S. ports for up to two years. On November 24, 2013, the P5+1 (the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia and China) entered into an interim agreement with Iran entitled the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA). Under the JPOA it was agreed that, in exchange for Iran taking certain voluntary measures to ensure that its nuclear program is used only for peaceful purposes, the U.S. and EU would voluntarily suspend certain sanctions for a period of six months. On January 20, 2014, the U.S. and E.U. indicated that they would begin implementing the temporary relief measures provided for under the JPOA. These measures include, among other things, the suspension of certain sanctions on the Iranian petrochemicals, precious metals, and automotive industries from January 20, 2014 until July 20, 2014. On July 18, 2014, the P5+1 and Iran agreed to extend the measures taken under JPOA until November 24, 2014. At that time, the P5+1 and Iran agreed to a further extension of these measures until July 1, 2015. On April 2, 2015, the P5+1 and Iran announced a framework agreement, according to which the P5+1 may gradually life some of the sanctions currently in place against Iran. Although we believe that we have been in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations, and intend to maintain such compliance, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future as such regulations and sanctions may be amended over time, and the U.S. retains the authority to revoke the aforementioned relief if Iran fails to meet its commitments under the JPOA. Any such violation could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions that could severely impact our ability to access U.S. capital markets and conduct our business, and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in us. In addition, certain institutional investors may have investment policies or restrictions that prevent them from holding securities of companies that have contracts with countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. The determination by these investors not to invest in, or to divest from, our common stock may adversely affect the price at which our common stock trades. Moreover, our charterers may violate applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations as a result of actions that do not involve us or our vessels, and those violations could in turn negatively affect our reputation. In addition, our reputation and the market for our securities may be adversely affected if we engage in certain other activities, such as entering into charters with individuals or entities in countries subject to U.S. sanctions and embargo laws that are not controlled by the governments of those countries, or engaging in operations associated with those countries pursuant to contracts with third parties that are unrelated to those countries or entities controlled by their governments. Investor perception of the value of our common stock may be adversely affected by the consequences of war, the effects of terrorism, civil unrest and governmental actions in these and surrounding countries. 16 Our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. We operate our vessels in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand and, as a result, in charterhire rates. This seasonality may result in volatility in our operating results to the extent that we enter into new charter agreements or renew existing agreements during a time when charter rates are weaker or we operate our vessels on the spot market or index based time charters, which may result in quarter-to-quarter volatility in our operating results. The dry bulk sector is typically stronger in the fall and winter months in anticipation of increased consumption of coal and other raw materials in the northern hemisphere. In addition, unpredictable weather patterns in these months tend to disrupt vessel scheduling and supplies of certain commodities. Since we charter our vessels principally in the spot market, our revenues from our dry bulk carriers may be weaker during the fiscal quarters ended June 30 and September 30, and stronger during the fiscal quarters ended December 31 and March 31. We are subject to international safety regulations, and the failure to comply with these regulations may subject us to increased liability, may adversely affect our insurance coverage and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. The operation of our vessels is affected by the requirements set forth in the United Nations International Maritime Organizations International Management Code (the ISM Code). The ISM Code requires shipowners, ship managers and bareboat charterers to develop and maintain an extensive Safety Management System that includes the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for safe operation of vessels and describing procedures for dealing with emergencies. In addition, vessel classification societies impose significant safety and other requirements on our vessels. The failure of a shipowner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM Code may subject it to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. Each of our existing vessels is ISM Code-certified, and each of the vessels that we have agreed to acquire will be ISM Code-certified when delivered to us. However, if we are found not to be in compliance with ISM Code requirements, we may have to incur material direct and indirect costs to resume compliance and our insurance coverage could be adversely impacted as a result of compliance. Our vessels may also be delayed or denied port access if they are found to be in non-compliance, which could result in charter claims and increased inspection and operational costs even after resuming compliance. Any failure to comply with the ISM Code could negatively affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Increased inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and disrupt our business. International shipping is subject to various security and customs inspection and related procedures in countries of origin and destination and trans-shipment points. Inspection procedures may result in the seizure of contents of our vessels, delays in the loading, offloading, trans-shipment or delivery and the levying of customs duties, fines or other penalties against us. It is possible that changes to inspection procedures could impose additional financial and legal obligations on us. Changes to inspection procedures could also impose additional costs and obligations on our customers and may, in certain cases, render the shipment of certain types of cargo uneconomical or impractical. Any such changes or developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 17 The operation of dry bulk carriers entails certain operational risks that could affect our earnings and cash flow. For a dry bulk carrier, the cargo itself and its interaction with the vessel can be an operational risk. By their nature, dry bulk cargoes are often heavy, dense and easily shifted and react badly to water exposure. In addition, dry bulk carriers are often subjected to battering treatment during unloading operations with grabs, jackhammers (to pry encrusted cargoes out of the hold) and small bulldozers. This treatment may cause damage to the vessel. Vessels damaged due to treatment during unloading procedures may be more susceptible to breach at sea. Hull breaches in dry bulk carriers may lead to the flooding of the vessels holds. If a dry bulk carrier suffers flooding in its forward holds, the bulk cargo may become so dense and waterlogged that its pressure may buckle the vessels bulkheads, leading to the loss of a vessel. If we are unable to adequately maintain our vessels, we may be unable to prevent these events. Any of these circumstances or events may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends. In addition, the loss of any of our vessels could harm our reputation as a safe and reliable vessel owner and operator. Rising fuel, or bunker, prices and marine fuel availability may adversely affect our profits. Since we expect to primarily employ our vessels in the spot market, we expect that vessel fuel, known as bunkers, will be the largest single expense item in our shipping operations for our vessels. While we believe that we will experience a competitive advantage as a result of increased bunker prices due to the greater fuel efficiency of our vessels compared to the average global fleet, changes in the price of fuel may adversely affect our profitability. The imposition of stringent vessel air emissions requirements, such as the requirement to reduce the amount of sulfur in fuel to 0.10% in certain coastal areas on January 1, 2015 and potentially in all areas of the world in 2020 or 2025, could lead to marine fuel shortages and substantial increases in marine fuel prices which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. Further, fuel may become much more expensive in the future, which may reduce our profitability and competitiveness of our business versus other forms of transportation, such as truck or rail. Our business has inherent operational risks, which may not be adequately covered by insurance. Our vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events or risks such as Acts of God, marine disasters, bad weather, mechanical failures, human error, environmental accidents, war, terrorism, piracy, cyber-attack, radioactive contamination and other circumstances or events. In addition, transporting cargoes across a wide variety of international jurisdictions creates a risk of business interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities, labor strikes and boycotts, the potential for changes in tax rates or policies, and the potential for government expropriation of our vessels. Any of these events may result in loss of revenues, increased costs and decreased cash flows to our customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to us under our charters. In the event of a casualty to a vessel or other catastrophic event, we rely on our insurance to pay the insured value of the vessel or the damages incurred. Through our management agreements with our technical managers, we procure insurance for the vessels in our fleet against those risks that we believe the shipping industry commonly insures against. This insurance includes marine hull and machinery insurance, protection insurance and indemnity insurance, which include pollution risks and crew insurances, and war risk insurance. Currently, the amount of coverage for liability for pollution, spillage and leakage available to us on commercially reasonable terms through protection and indemnity associations and providers of excess coverage is $1.0 billion per vessel per occurrence. 18 We maintain and expect to maintain hull and machinery insurance, protection insurance and indemnity insurance for all of our existing and newbuilding vessels, which includes environmental damage and pollution insurance coverage and war risk insurance for our fleet. We do not maintain nor expect to maintain, for our vessels, insurance against loss of hire, which covers business interruptions that result from the loss of use of a vessel. Therefore, if the availability of a vessel for hire is interrupted, the loss of earnings due to such interruption could negatively affect our business. We may not be adequately insured against all risks. We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for our fleet in the future, and we may not be able to obtain certain insurance coverages. The insurers may not pay particular claims. Our insurance policies may contain deductibles for which we will be responsible and limitations and exclusions which may increase our costs or lower our revenue. Moreover, insurers may default on claims they are required to pay. We cannot assure you that we will be adequately insured against all risks or that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates for our vessels in the future. For example, in the past more stringent environmental regulations have led to increased costs for, and in the future may result in the lack of availability of, insurance against risks of environmental damage or pollution. Additionally, our insurers may refuse to pay particular claims. Any significant loss or liability for which we are not insured could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We may be subject to calls because we obtain some of our insurance through protection and indemnity associations. We may be subject to increased premium payments, or calls, in amounts based on our claim records and the claim records of our fleet managers as well as the claim records of other members of the protection and indemnity associations (P&I Associations) through which we receive insurance coverage for tort liability, including pollution-related liability. In addition, our P&I Associations may not have enough resources to cover claims made against them. Our payment of these calls could result in a significant expense to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Labor interruptions could disrupt our business. Star Bulk Management Inc. and Starbulk S.A. currently provide the crew for all of our vessels, which are manned by masters, officers and crews that are employed by our shipowning subsidiaries. If not resolved in a timely and cost-effective manner, industrial action or other labor unrest could prevent or hinder our operations from being carried out normally and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The smuggling of drugs or other contraband onto our vessels may lead to governmental claims against us. Our vessels may call in ports where smugglers attempt to hide drugs and other contraband on vessels, with or without the knowledge of crew members. To the extent our vessels are found with contraband, whether inside or attached to the hull of our vessel and whether with or without the knowledge of any of our crew, we may face governmental or other regulatory claims or restrictions which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Maritime claimants could arrest one or more of our vessels, which could interrupt our cash flow. Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against a vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a claimant may seek to obtain security for its claim by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of our vessels could interrupt our cash flow and require us to pay large sums of money to have the arrest or attachment lifted. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the sister ship theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel which is subject to the claimants maritime lien and any associated vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could attempt to assert sister ship liability against one vessel in our fleet for claims relating to another of our vessels. Governments could requisition our vessels during a period of war or emergency, resulting in a loss of earnings. A government could requisition one or more of our vessels for title or for hire. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes its owner, while requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes its charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during periods of war or emergency, although governments may elect to requisition vessels in other circumstances. Although we would be entitled to compensation in the event of a requisition of one or more of our vessels, the amount and timing of payment would be uncertain. Government requisition of one or more of our vessels may negatively impact our revenues. 19 We operate our vessels worldwide and as a result, our vessels are exposed to international risks which may reduce revenue or increase expenses. The international shipping industry is an inherently risky business involving global operations. Our vessels and their cargoes are at a risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as mechanical failure, collision, human error, war, terrorism, piracy, marine disasters, and bad weather and other acts of God. In addition, changing economic, regulatory and political conditions in some countries, including political and military conflicts, have from time to time resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways, piracy, terrorism, labor strikes and boycotts. These sorts of events could interfere with shipping routes and result in market disruptions which may reduce our revenue or increase our expenses. Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA) could result in fines, criminal penalties, charter terminations and an adverse effect on our business. We may operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including countries known to have a reputation for corruption. We are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA. We are subject, however, to the risk that we, our affiliated entities or our or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents may take actions determined to be in violation of such anti-corruption laws. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and might adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business. Furthermore, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management. Because we generate all of our revenues in U.S. dollars but incur a portion of our expenses in other currencies, exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We generate all of our revenue in U.S. dollars, and the majority of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, a portion of our ship operating and administrative expenses are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and, 2014, we incurred approximately 30% and 20%, respectively, of our operating expenses and 88% and 47%, respectively, of our general and administrative expenses in currencies other than U.S. dollars. This difference could lead to fluctuations in net income due to changes in the value of the dollar relative to the other currencies, in particular the Euro. Expenses incurred in foreign currencies against which the dollar falls in value can increase, decreasing our revenues. Declines in the value of the dollar could lead to higher expenses payable by us. While we historically have not mitigated the risk associated with exchange rate fluctuations through the use of financial derivatives, we may employ such instruments from time to time in the future in order to minimize this risk. Any future use of financial derivatives would involve certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedged position could exceed the notional amount invested in the instrument and the risk that the counterparty to the derivative transaction may be unable or unwilling to satisfy its contractual obligations, which could have an adverse effect on our results. Risks Related to Our Company We cannot assure you that we will be successful in finding employment for all of our vessels. As of April 6, 2015, our existing fleet of 68 vessels, had an aggregate capacity of approximately 7.1 million dwt. We have also entered into or acquired construction contracts, either directly with the shipyards or indirectly through the use of bareboat agreements with purchase options, for 29 newbuilding vessels, with scheduled deliveries to us from April 2015 to September 2016. We intend to employ our vessels primarily in the spot market, under short term time charters or voyage charters. We will own a large number of vessels that will enter these markets in a relatively short period of time without having previously secured employment. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in finding employment for our newbuilding vessels in the volatile spot market immediately upon their deliveries to us or whether any such employment will be at profitable rates, nor can we assure you continued timely employment of our existing vessels. 20 We have significant risks relating to the construction of our newbuilding vessels. As of April 6, 2015, giving effect to the Transactions, we had contracts for 29 newbuilding vessels. These vessels are scheduled to be delivered through September 2016. Vessel construction projects are generally subject to risks of delay or cost overruns that are inherent in any large construction project, which may be caused by numerous factors, including shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor, unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment or shipyard construction, failure of equipment to meet quality and/or performance standards, financial or operating difficulties experienced by equipment vendors or the shipyard, unanticipated actual or purported change orders, inability to obtain required permits or approvals, unanticipated cost increases between order and delivery, design or engineering changes and work stoppages and other labor disputes, adverse weather conditions or any other events of force majeure. Significant cost overruns or delays could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, failure to complete a project on time may result in the delay of revenue from that vessel, and we will continue to incur costs and expenses related to delayed vessels, such as supervision expense and interest expense for the outstanding debt. We continue to have significant capital expenditures, which increased substantially as a result of the Transactions. The dry bulk shipping business is highly capital-intensive because of the significant investment in vessels that is required. As of April 6, 2015, the total payments for our 29 newbuilding vessels were expected to be $1,296.1 million, of which we had already paid $258.6 million. As of April 6, 2015, we had $208.4 million of cash on hand, we had obtained commitments for $832.1 million of secured debt for 27 newbuilding vessels, and we were in negotiations for an additional $65.0 million of secured debt for two newbuilding vessels. We may not be able to obtain sufficient financing to fulfill all of our capital requirements. If we are not able to borrow additional funds, raise other capital or utilize available cash on hand, we may not be able to acquire our newbuilding vessels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We expect to fund our remaining newbuilding commitments through credit facilities, the proceeds of equity and notes issuances, existing cash, bareboat charters and other fixed income securities but may not be able to do so. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financings on a timely basis or on terms we deem reasonable or acceptable. To the degree we raise equity financing to fund our capital expenditures, such equity raises may dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders and may be dilutive to our earnings per share. If for any reason we fail to make a payment when due, which may result in a default under our newbuilding contracts, or otherwise fail to take delivery of our newbuilding vessels, we would be prevented from realizing potential revenues from these vessels, we could also lose all or a portion of our yard payments that were paid by us, and we could be liable for penalties and damages under such contracts. We are highly leveraged, which could significantly limit our ability to execute our business strategy and has increased the risk of default under our debt obligations. As of April 6, 2015, we had $935.9 million of outstanding indebtedness under our outstanding credit facilities and debt securities including $41.2 million under our capital lease obligations. Our outstanding debt agreements impose operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability, or the ability of our subsidiaries party thereto, to: • pay dividends and make capital expenditures if we do not repay amounts drawn under our credit facilities or if there is another default under our credit facilities; • incur additional indebtedness, including the issuance of guarantees; 21 • create liens on our assets; • change the flag, class or management of our vessels or terminate or materially amend the management agreement relating to each vessel; • sell our vessels; • merge or consolidate with, or transfer all or substantially all our assets to, another person; or • enter into a new line of business. In addition, our debt agreements require us or our subsidiaries to maintain various financial ratios, including: • a minimum percentage of aggregate vessel value to loans outstanding; • a maximum ratio of total liabilities to market value adjusted total assets; • a minimum EBITDA to interest coverage ratio; • a minimum liquidity; and • a minimum equity ratio. Because some of these ratios are dependent on the market value of our vessels, should our charter rates or vessel values materially decline in the future, we may be required to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives to meet any such financial ratios and satisfy any such financial covenants. Events beyond our control, including changes in the economic and business conditions in the shipping markets in which we operate, may affect our ability to comply with these covenants. We cannot assure you that we will meet these ratios or satisfy our financial or other covenants or that our lenders will waive any failure to do so. These covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or take certain corporate actions. The covenants may also restrict our flexibility in planning for changes in our business and the industry and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments. A breach of any of the covenants in, or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios under, our debt agreements would prevent us from borrowing additional money under our debt agreements and could result in a default under our debt agreements. If a default occurs under our credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare the outstanding debt, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and foreclose on the collateral securing that debt, which could constitute all or substantially all of our assets. Our ability to meet our cash requirements, including our debt service obligations, is dependent upon our operating performance, which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are or may be beyond our control. We cannot provide assurance that our business operations will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fund these cash requirements and debt service obligations. If our operating results, cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations. If we are unable to service our debt, we could be forced to reduce or delay planned expansions and capital expenditures, sell assets, restructure or refinance our debt or seek additional equity capital, and we may be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner. Further, any of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to service our debt obligations or may have an adverse impact on our business. Our debt agreements may limit our ability to take certain of these actions. Our failure to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay our debts or to successfully undertake any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on us. 22 Our substantial leverage could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes, could make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions, and could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in the markets in which we compete. We are subject to certain risks with respect to our counterparties on contracts, and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or otherwise adversely affect our business. We have entered into, and may enter into in the future, various contracts, including charterparties and contracts of affreightment (COAs) with our customers, newbuilding contracts with shipyards and credit facilities with our lenders. We also enter into time charters and voyage charters as a charterer. These agreements subject us to counterparty risks. The ability of each of our counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with us will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the maritime industry, the overall financial condition of the counterparty, charter rates received for specific types of vessels, and various expenses. In addition, in the event any shipyards do not perform under their contracts, and we are unable to enforce certain refund guarantees with third-party lenders for any reason, we may lose all or part of our investment, and we may not be able to operate the vessels we ordered in accordance with our business plan. Should our counterparties fail to honor their obligations under agreements with us, we could sustain significant losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are currently prohibited from paying dividends under our debt agreements, and we may be unable to pay dividends in the future. Under the terms of a number of our outstanding financing arrangements, we are subject to various restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Certain of our financing arrangements prevent us from paying dividends if an event of default exists, if certain dates have not passed and/or if certain financial ratios are not met. See Note 9, Long Term Debt to our audited consolidated financial statements, for more information regarding these restrictions contained in our historical financing arrangements. In general, when dividends are paid, they are distributed on a quarterly basis from our operating surplus, in amounts that allow us to retain a portion of our cash flows to fund vessel or fleet acquisitions and for debt repayment and other corporate purposes, as determined by our management and board of directors. In addition, the declaration and payment of dividends will be subject at all times to the discretion of our board of directors. The timing and amount of dividends will depend on our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, fleet renewal and expansion, restrictions in our loan agreements, the provisions of Marshall Islands law affecting the payment of dividends and other factors. The laws of the Republic of Marshall Islands generally prohibit the payment of dividends other than from surplus (retained earnings and the excess of consideration received for the sale of shares above the par value of the shares) or while a company is insolvent or would be rendered insolvent by the payment of such a dividend. We may not have sufficient surplus in the future to pay dividends and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient funds or surplus to make distributions to us. We can give no assurance that dividends will be paid at all. We may be unable to attract and retain qualified, skilled employees or crew necessary to operate our business. Our success depends in large part on the ability of us to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel, both shoreside personnel and crew. In crewing our vessels, we require technically skilled employees with specialized training who can perform physically demanding work. Competition to attract and retain qualified crew members is intense due to the increase in the size of the global shipping fleet. In addition, if we are not able to obtain higher charter rates to compensate for any crew cost increases, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends. If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may be unable to manage, maintain and grow our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 23 As we expand our fleet, we will need to expand our operations and financial systems and hire new shoreside staff and seafarers to staff our vessels; if we cannot expand these systems or recruit suitable employees, our performance may be adversely affected. As of April 6, 2015, we have newbuilding contracts for 29 dry bulk vessels and expect to receive the last Excel Vessel (the Ore Hansa (tbr Star Jennifer) by mid-April 2015. Our operating and financial systems may not be adequate as we expand our fleet, and our attempts to implement those systems may be ineffective. In addition, we rely on our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Star Bulk Management and Starbulk S.A., to recruit shoreside administrative and management personnel and for crew management. Shoreside personnel are recruited by Star Bulk Management and Starbulk S.A. through referrals from other shipping companies and traditional methods of securing personnel, such as placing classified advertisements in shipping industry periodicals. Star Bulk Management, Starbulk S.A. and its crewing agent may not be able to continue to hire suitable employees as we expand our fleet. If we are unable to operate our financial and operations systems effectively, recruit suitable employees or if our unaffiliated crewing agent encounters business or financial difficulties, our performance may be materially and adversely affected and, among other things, the amount of cash available for distribution as dividends to our shareholders may be reduced. If we acquire and operate secondhand vessels, we will be exposed to increased operating and other costs, which could adversely affect our earnings and, as our fleet ages, the risks associated with older vessels could adversely affect our ability to obtain profitable charters. Our current business strategy includes additional growth which may, in addition to the acquisition of newbuilding vessels, include the acquisition of modern secondhand vessels. While we expect that we would typically inspect secondhand vessels prior to acquisition, this does not provide us with the same knowledge about their condition that we would have had if these vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by us. Generally, we, as a purchaser of secondhand vessels will not receive the benefit of warranties from the builders for the secondhand vessels that we acquire. In addition, unforeseen maintenance, repairs, special surveys or dry docking may be necessary for acquired secondhand vessels, which could also increase our costs and reduce our ability to employ the vessel to generate revenue. Governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards related to the age of vessels may require expenditures for alterations or the addition of new equipment, to our vessels and may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage. As our vessels age, market conditions may not justify those expenditures or enable us to operate our vessels profitably during the remainder of their useful lives. The aging of our vessels may result in increased operating costs in the future, which could adversely affect our earnings. In general, the cost of maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increases with the age of the vessel. As our vessels age they will typically become less fuel-efficient and more costly to maintain than more recently constructed vessels due to improvements in engine technology. Cargo insurance rates increase with the age of a vessel, making older vessels less desirable to charterers. Governmental regulations and safety or other equipment standards related to the age of vessels may also require expenditures for alterations or the addition of new equipment to our vessels and may restrict the type of activities in which our vessels may engage. As our vessels age, market conditions may not justify those expenditures or may not enable us to operate our vessels profitably during the remainder of their useful lives. Technological innovation could reduce our charterhire income and the value of our vessels. The charterhire rates and the value and operational life of a vessel are determined by a number of factors including the vessels efficiency, operational flexibility and physical life. Efficiency includes speed, fuel economy and the ability to load and discharge cargo quickly. Flexibility includes the ability to enter harbors, utilize related docking facilities and pass through canals and straits. The length of a vessels physical life is related to its original design and construction, its maintenance and the impact of the stress of operations. If new dry bulk carriers are built that are more efficient or more flexible or have longer physical lives than our vessels, competition from these more technologically advanced vessels could adversely affect the amount of charterhire payments we receive for our vessels once their initial charters expire and the resale value of our vessels could significantly decrease. In addition, although we view the fuel efficiency of our newbuilding Eco-type vessels as a competitive advantage, this competitive advantage may eventually erode (along with vessel value) as more Eco-type vessels are put into service by our competitors and older, less fuel-efficient vessels are retired. As a result, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected by technological innovation. 24 In the highly competitive international shipping industry, we may not be able to compete for charters with new entrants or established companies with greater resources, and as a result, we may be unable to employ our vessels profitably. Our vessels will be employed in a highly competitive market that is capital intensive and highly fragmented. Competition arises primarily from other vessel owners, some of whom have substantially greater resources than we do. Competition for the transportation of dry bulk cargo by sea is intense and depends on price, location, size, age, condition and the acceptability of the vessel and its operators to the charterers. Due in part to the highly fragmented market, competitors with greater resources could enter the dry bulk shipping industry and operate larger fleets through consolidations or acquisitions and may be able to offer lower charter rates and higher quality vessels than we are able to offer. If we are unable to successfully compete with other dry bulk shipping companies, our results of operations would be adversely impacted. We may be subject to litigation that, if not resolved in our favor and not sufficiently insured against, could have a material adverse effect on us. We may be, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters. These matters may include, among other things, contract disputes, shareholder litigation, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties, and other litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. Although we intend to defend these matters vigorously, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter, and the ultimate outcome of any litigation or the potential costs to resolve them may have a material adverse effect on us. Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases and/or insurers may not remain solvent which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We may have difficulty managing our planned growth properly. Historically, we have grown through acquisitions, including the July 2014 Transactions and the Excel Transactions, and we have a significant number of newbuilding vessels to be delivered. In addition, one of our strategies is to continue to grow by expanding our operations and adding to our fleet. Our future growth will primarily depend upon a number of factors, some of which may not be within our control. These factors include our ability to: • identify suitable dry bulk carriers, including newbuilding slots at shipyards and/or shipping companies for acquisitions at attractive prices; • obtain required financing for our existing and new operations; • identify businesses engaged in managing, operating or owning dry bulk carriers for acquisitions or joint ventures; • integrate any acquired dry bulk carriers or businesses successfully with our existing operations, including obtaining any approvals and qualifications necessary to operate vessels that we acquire; • hire, train and retain qualified personnel and crew to manage and operate our growing business and fleet; • identify additional new markets; 25 • enhance our customer base; and • improve our operating, financial and accounting systems and controls. Our failure to effectively identify, acquire, develop and integrate any dry bulk carriers or businesses could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The number of employees that perform services for us and our current operating and financial systems may not be adequate as we implement our plan to expand the size of our fleet in the dry bulk sector, and we may not be able to effectively hire more employees or adequately improve those systems. Finally, acquisitions may require additional equity issuances, which may dilute our common shareholders if issued at lower prices than the price they acquired their shares, or debt issuances (with amortization payments), both of which could lower our available cash. If any such events occur, our financial condition may be adversely affected. We cannot give any assurance that we will be successful in executing our growth plans or that we will not incur significant expenses and losses in connection with our future growth. In the July 2014 Transactions, we acquired a 50% interest in Heron, an entity we do not control. In the July 2014 Transactions, we acquired a convertible loan to Heron, which has been converted into 50% of the equity of Heron. Heron is a 50-50 joint venture between Oceanbulk Shipping and ABY Group Holding Limited, and we share joint control over Heron with ABY Group Holding Limited. Because of this arrangement, neither party entirely controls Heron, and any operational and other decisions with respect to Heron need to be jointly agreed between Oceanbulk Shipping and ABY Group Holding Limited. As of April 6, 2015, all vessels previously owned by Heron have been either sold to third parties or distributed to Herons equity holders. As part of these distributions, we acquired the two Heron Vessels. While Oceanbulk Shipping and ABY Group Holding Limited intend that Heron eventually will be dissolved shortly after the last vessel is sold and local authorities permit, until that occurs, contingencies to us may arise. However, the pre-transaction investors in Heron will effectively remain as ultimate beneficial owners of Heron, until Heron is dissolved on the basis that, according to the Merger Agreement, any cash received from the final liquidation of Heron will be transferred to the Sellers. Under the Merger Agreement, we only agreed to issue 2,115,706 of our common shares and pay an amount of $25.0 million in cash, for the acquisition of the two Heron Vessels. Certain benefits we expect from the Transactions are based on projections and assumptions, which are uncertain and subject to change. We have made certain estimates and assumptions with respect to certain benefits that we expect from the July 2014 Transactions that affect the reported amounts of earnings, assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, earnings per share and related information included in our historical consolidated financial statements and pro forma financial information, as well as EBITDA and other measures derived from that information. In addition, in connection with the Excel Transactions, we have made various estimates and assumptions with respect to the eventual operations and chartering of the Excel Vessels as we acquire them. These estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate or may change in the future, and actual results could differ materially from those estimates or assumptions. There can be no assurance that we will realize these benefits, including anticipated synergistic benefits, if any, as a result of the Transactions. The market price of our common shares may decline if the estimates are not realized or we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the Transactions, including perceived benefits to our cash flows and EBITDA, earnings and earnings per share, as rapidly or to the extent anticipated. Our ability to realize benefits from the Transactions is subject to various integration and other risks, and if we fail to realize such benefits, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Integrating the assets and operations acquired in the Transactions successfully or otherwise realizing any of the anticipated benefits of the Transactions, including anticipated cost savings and additional revenue opportunities, involves a number of risks and uncertainties, including: • our ability to integrate the management teams, strategies, cultures, technologies and operations of the various entities or vessels involved in the Transactions; 26 • our ability to retain and assimilate key personnel (and retain their technical and operational expertise); • our ability to retain existing customers; • our ability to successfully implement and retain uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems in the face of possible cultural conflicts or differences of opinion on technical and operational decisions; • our ability to smoothly transition ownership and operation of acquired vessels (including the Excel Vessels), including avoiding disruptions resulting from crewing, procurement, bunkering, supply, dry docking, maintenance and other similar matters; • our ability to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies we anticipated; • diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns to integration matters; • possible cash flow interruptions or loss of revenue as a result of change of ownership transitional matters related to the Transactions; • the disruption of each companys ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies due to the Transactions; and • our ability to maintain relationships with key suppliers. Therefore, we may not successfully integrate the assets and operations acquired in the Transactions in a timely manner, and we may not realize the anticipated net reductions in costs and expenses and other benefits of the Transactions to the extent, or in the timeframe, anticipated. In addition to the integration risks discussed above, our ability to realize these net reductions in costs and expenses and other benefits and synergies could be adversely impacted by practical or legal constraints on our ability to combine the operations we acquired in the Transactions. We may experience impairment of the value of long-lived assets. The value of our long-lived assets can become impaired, as indicated by factors such as changes in our stock price, book value or market capitalization, and the past and anticipated operating performance and cash flows of operations. We test for impairment regularly, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We will be exposed to volatility in the LIBOR and intend to selectively enter into derivative contracts, which can result in higher than market interest rates and charges against our income. The loans under our credit facilities are generally advanced at a floating rate based on LIBOR, which has been stable, but was volatile in prior years, which can affect the amount of interest payable on our debt, and which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our earnings and cash flow. In addition, in recent years, LIBOR has been at relatively low levels, and may rise in the future as the current low interest rate environment comes to an end. Our financial condition could be materially adversely affected at any time that we have not entered into interest rate hedging arrangements to hedge our exposure to the interest rates applicable to our credit facilities and any other financing arrangements we may enter into in the future, including those we enter into to finance a portion of the amounts payable with respect to newbuildings. Moreover, even if we have entered into interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments for purposes of managing our interest rate exposure, our hedging strategies may not be effective and we may incur substantial losses. We intend to selectively enter into derivative contracts to hedge our overall exposure to interest rate risk exposure. Entering into swaps and derivatives transactions is inherently risky and presents various possibilities for incurring significant expenses. The derivatives strategies that we employ in the future may not be successful or effective, and we could, as a result, incur substantial additional interest costs. See Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Interest Rate for a description of our expected interest rate swap arrangements. 27 We have made and in the future may make acquisitions and significant strategic investments and acquisitions, which may involve a number of risks. If we are unable to address these risks successfully, such acquisitions and investments could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have undertaken a number of acquisitions and investments in the past, including the Transactions, and may do so from time to time in the future. The risks involved with these acquisitions and investments include: • the possibility that we may not receive a favorable return on our investment or incur losses from our investment, or the original investment may become impaired; • failure to satisfy or set effective strategic objectives; • our assumption of known or unknown liabilities or other unanticipated events or circumstances; • the diversion of managements attention from normal daily operations of the business; • difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired company or its assets; • difficulties in supporting acquired operations; • difficulties or delays in the transfer of vessels, equipment or personnel; • failure to retain key personnel; • unexpected capital equipment outlays and related expenses; • insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions; • under-performance problems with acquired assets or operations; • issuance of common stock that could dilute our current shareholders; • recording of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to periodic impairment testing and potential impairment charges against our future earnings; • the opportunity cost associated with committing capital in such investments; • undisclosed defects, damage, maintenance requirements or similar matters relating to acquired vessels; • becoming subject to litigation. We may not be able to address these risks successfully without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financial problems. Any delays or other such operations or financial problems could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 28 Our costs of operating as a public company are significant, and our management is required to devote substantial time to complying with public company regulations. We are a public company, and as such, we have significant legal, accounting and other expenses in addition to our registration and listing expenses. In addition, Sarbanes-Oxley, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq, has imposed various requirements on public companies, including changes in corporate governance practices, and these requirements may continue to evolve. We and our management personnel, and other personnel, if any, will need to devote a substantial amount of time to comply with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. Sarbanes-Oxley requires, among other things, that we maintain and periodically evaluate our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we need to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. Our compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expenses and expend significant management efforts. Because the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is not currently permitted to inspect our independent accounting firm, you may not benefit from such inspections. Auditors of U.S. public companies are required by law to undergo periodic Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB), inspections that assess their compliance with U.S. law and professional standards in connection with performance of audits of financial statements filed with the SEC. Certain European Union countries, including Greece, do not currently permit the PCAOB to conduct inspections of accounting firms established and operating in such European Union countries, even if they are part of major international firms. Accordingly, unlike for most U.S. public companies, the PCAOB is prevented from evaluating our auditors performance of audits and its quality control procedures, and, unlike shareholders of most U.S. public companies, we and our shareholders are deprived of the possible benefits of such inspections. We may be adversely affected by the introduction of new accounting rules for leasing. International and U.S. accounting standard-setting boards (the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)) have issued new exposure drafts in their joint project that would require lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets as lease assets and liabilities. Entities would still classify leases, but classification would be based on different criteria and would serve a different purpose than it does today. Lease classification would determine how entities recognize lease-related revenue and expense, as well as what lessors record on the balance sheet. Classification would be based on the portion of the economic benefits of the underlying asset expected to be consumed by the lessee over the lease term. If the proposals are adopted, they would be expected generally to have the effect of bringing most off-balance sheet leases onto a lessees balance sheet as liabilities, which would also change the income and expense recognition patterns of those items. Financial statement metrics such as leverage and capital ratios, as well as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, may also be affected, even when cash flow and business activity have not changed. This may in turn affect covenant calculations under various contracts (e.g., loan agreements) unless the affected contracts are modified. The IASBs and FASBs deliberations on certain topics are expected to continue, and an effective date has not yet been determined. Accordingly, the timing and ultimate effect of those proposals on us is uncertain. 29 There is a risk that we could be treated as a U.S. domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the merger of Star Maritime with and into Star Bulk, with Star Bulk as the surviving corporation, or the Redomiciliation Merger, which would adversely affect our earnings. Section 7874(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), provides that, unless certain requirements are satisfied, a corporation organized outside of the United States which acquires substantially all of the assets (through a plan or a series of related transactions) of a corporation organized in the United States will be treated as a U.S. domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if shareholders of the U.S. corporation whose assets are being acquired own at least 80% of the non-U.S. acquiring corporation after the acquisition. If Section 7874(b) of the Code were to apply to Star Maritime and the Redomiciliation Merger, then, among other consequences, we, as the surviving entity of the Redomiciliation Merger, would be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a U.S. domestic corporation on our worldwide income after the Redomiciliation Merger. Upon completion of the Redomiciliation Merger and the concurrent issuance of stock to TMT Co. Ltd., or TMT, a shipping company headquartered in Taiwan, under the acquisition agreements, the shareholders of Star Maritime owned less than 80% of the Company. Therefore, we believe that the Company should not be subject to Section 7874(b) of the Code after the Redomiciliation Merger. Star Maritime obtained an opinion of its counsel, Seward & Kissel LLP, or Seward & Kissel, that Section 7874(b) of the Code should not apply to the Redomiciliation Merger. However, there is no authority directly addressing the application of Section 7874(b) of the Code to a transaction such as the Redomiciliation Merger where shares in a foreign corporation such as the Company are issued concurrently with (or shortly after) a merger. In particular, since there is no authority directly applying the series of related transactions or plan provisions to the post-acquisition stock ownership requirements of Section 7874(b) of the Code, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, may not agree with Seward & Kissels opinion on this matter. Moreover, Star Maritime has not sought a ruling from the IRS on this point. Therefore, the IRS may seek to assert that we are subject to U.S. federal income tax on our worldwide income for taxable years after the Redomiciliation Merger, although Seward & Kissel is of the opinion that such an assertion should not be successful. Beginning in 2015 we have to pay U.S. federal income tax on our U.S. source income. Under the Code, 50% of the gross shipping income of a non-U.S. corporation, such as ourselves, that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States is characterized as United States source gross shipping income, and such income is subject to a 4% U.S. federal income tax without allowance for any deductions, unless the corporation qualifies for exemption from U.S. federal income taxation under Section 883 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. We do not expect to qualify for the exemption from U.S. federal income taxation under Section 883 of the Code beginning in 2015 and for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we will be subject to the 4% U.S. federal income tax on our United States source gross shipping income. If a significant portion of our income is United States source gross shipping income, the imposition of such tax could have a negative effect on our business and would result in decreased earnings available for distribution to our shareholders. In 2014, if we had not qualified for such an exemption, we would have owed approximately $202,230 in U.S. federal income tax. We expect our United States source gross shipping income to increase in 2015 due to an increase in the size of our fleet, and, accordingly, we expect our U.S. federal income tax liability in 2015 to be larger than $202,230. The Internal Revenue Service could treat us as a passive foreign investment company, which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. shareholders. A non-U.S. corporation will be treated as a passive foreign investment company (a PFIC) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for any taxable year consists of certain types of passive income (e.g., dividends, interest, capital gains and rents derived other than in the active conduct of a rental business) or (2) at least 50% of the average value of the corporations assets produce or are held for the production of passive income. For purposes of determining the PFIC status of a non-U.S. corporation, income earned in connection with the performance of services does not constitute passive income, but rental income generally is treated as passive income unless the non-U.S. corporation is treated under specific rules as deriving its rental income in the active conduct of a trade or business. We intend to take the position that income we derive from our voyage and time chartering activities is services income, rather than rental income, and accordingly, that such income is not passive income for purposes of determining our PFIC status. Based on this characterization of income from voyage and time charters and the expected composition of our income and assets, we believe that we currently are not a PFIC, and we do not expect to become a PFIC in the future. Additionally, we believe that our contracts for newbuilding vessels are not assets held for the production of passive income, because we intend to use these vessels for voyage and time chartering activities. However, there is no direct legal authority under the PFIC rules addressing our characterization of income from our voyage and time chartering activities nor our characterization of contracts for newbuilding vessels. Moreover, the determination of PFIC status for any year can only be made on an annual basis after the end of such taxable year and will depend on the composition of our income, assets and operations from time to time. Because of the above described uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge the determination made by us concerning our PFIC status or that we will not be a PFIC for any taxable year. 30 If we were classified as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. shareholder owns common shares (regardless of whether we continue to be a PFIC), the U.S. shareholder would be subject to special adverse rules, including taxation at maximum ordinary income rates plus an interest charge on both gains on sale and certain dividends, unless the U.S. shareholder makes an election to be taxed under an alternative regime. Certain elections may be available to U.S. shareholders if we were classified as a PFIC. Risks Related to Our Relationships with Mr. Pappas, Oaktree and Other Parties Affiliates of Oaktree own a majority of our common shares, subject to certain restrictions on voting, acquisitions and dispositions thereof. As of April 6, 2015, Oaktree and its affiliates beneficially own 82,154,649 common shares, which would represent approximately 50.81% of our outstanding common shares. However, pursuant to the Oaktree Shareholders Agreement, Oaktree and certain affiliates thereof have agreed to voting restrictions, ownership limitations and standstill restrictions. For instance, Oaktree and its affiliates will be entitled to nominate a maximum of four out of nine members of our board of directors, subject to certain additional limitations. In addition, Oaktree and its affiliates will be required to vote their voting securities in excess of 33% of the outstanding voting securities (subject to adjustment as set forth in the Oaktree Shareholders Agreement) proportionately with the votes cast by the other shareholders, subject to certain exceptions, which include (i) voting against a change of control transaction with an unaffiliated buyer and (ii) voting in favor of a change of control transaction with an unaffiliated buyer (but only if such transaction is approved by a majority of disinterested directors). In addition, Oaktree and affiliates thereof will be subject to certain standstill restrictions, and may not receive a control premium for their common shares as part of a change of control transaction. Despite the foregoing limitations, Oaktree and its affiliates are able to exert considerable influence over us. Oaktree and its affiliates may be able to prevent or delay a change of control of us and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of us. The concentration of ownership and voting power in Oaktree may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of Oaktree, even if such events are in the best interests of our other shareholders. The concentration of voting power in Oaktree may have an adverse effect on the price of our common shares. As a result of such influence, we may take actions that our other shareholders do not view as beneficial, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and cause the value of your investment to decline. Additionally, Oaktree is in the business of making investments in companies and currently holds, and may from time to time in the future acquire, interests in the shipping industry that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. Further, if Oaktree pursues acquisitions or makes further investments in the shipping industry, those acquisitions and investment opportunities may not be available to us, and we have agreed to renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any corporate opportunities that may be presented to or become known to Oaktree or any of its affiliates. In addition, the members of the board of directors nominated by Oaktree will have fiduciary duties to us and in addition may have duties to Oaktree. As a result, such circumstances may entail real or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting both us and Oaktree, whose interests, in some circumstances, may be adverse to ours. Our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Petros Pappas, and certain members of his family have affiliations with Oceanbulk Maritime S.A. (Oceanbulk Maritime), Interchart Shipping Inc. (Interchart) and other ventures, which could create conflicts of interest. Certain members of our senior management also have affiliations with Oceanbulk Maritime and other ventures that could create conflicts of interest. While we do not expect that our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Petros Pappas, will have any material relationships with any companies in the dry bulk shipping industry other than us, he will continue to be involved in other areas of the shipping industry, including as the founder of Oceanbulk Maritime, a dry cargo shipping company, and as a member of the management of Oceanbulk Container Carriers LLC, and PST Tankers LLC, which are other joint ventures between Oaktree and entities controlled by the family of Mr. Petros Pappas involved in the container shipping and product tanker businesses, respectively. Ms. Pappas is a significant equity holder of Oceanbulk Maritime and Interchart, a charter broker company, and an equity holder in various other entities, some of which are involved in the dry bulk shipping industry. These other affiliations and ventures could cause distraction to Mr. Pappas as our Chief Executive Officer if he focuses a substantial portion of his time on them, and the involvement of Ms. Pappas with other ventures could cause conflicts of interest with us. 31 Certain members of our senior management (Messrs. Norton, Begleris, Spyrou and Rescos and Ms. Damigou) are also members of the management of Oceanbulk Maritime, Oceanbulk Container Carriers LLC or PST Tankers LLC. These other affiliations and ventures could cause distraction to such members of senior management if they focus a substantial portion of their time on such affiliations and ventures. Any of these affiliations and relationships of Mr. Pappas, certain members of his family and certain members of our senior management may create conflicts of interest not in the best interest of us or our shareholders from time to time. This could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a foreign private issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we are permitted to, and we may, rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance standards of the Nasdaq, including, among others, the requirement that a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors. Our reliance upon such exemptions may afford less protection to holders of our common shares. The corporate governance rules of the Nasdaq require, subject to exceptions, listed companies to have, among other things, a majority of their board members be independent and independent director oversight of executive compensation, nomination of directors and corporate governance matters. Nevertheless, a foreign private issuer (as defined in Rule 3b-4 of the Exchange Act) is permitted to follow its home country practice in lieu of the above requirements. We are a foreign private issuer, and, as such, we may follow the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, our home country, with respect to the foregoing requirements. For example, our board of directors is not required by the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands to have a majority of independent directors, so, while our board of directors includes seven members that would likely be deemed independent for purposes of the Nasdaq rules, we are not required to comply with the Nasdaq rule that requires us to have a majority of independent directors, and we may in the future have less than a majority of directors who would be deemed independent for purposes of the Nasdaq rules. Consequently, for so long as we remain a foreign private issuer, the approach of our board of directors may be different from that of a board of directors required to have a majority of independent directors, and as a result, our management oversight may be more limited than if we were required to comply with the Nasdaq rules applicable to U.S. domestic listed companies. If in the future we lose our status as a foreign private issuer, we would be required to comply with the rules of the Nasdaq applicable to U.S. domestic listed companies within six months. We may lose our foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant additional costs and expenses. We are a foreign private issuer, and therefore, we are not required to comply with all of the periodic disclosure and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to U.S. domestic companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act. The determination of foreign private issuer status is made annually on the last business day of an issuers most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and accordingly the next determination will be made with respect to us on June 30, 2015. We will lose our foreign private issuer status if more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly held of record by residents of the U.S., and: • more than a majority of our executive officers and directors are U.S. citizens or residents; 32 • more than 50% of our assets are located in the U.S.; or • our business is administered principally in the U.S. We may therefore lose our foreign private issuer status in the future. If we were to lose our foreign private issuer status, we would be required to file with the SEC periodic reports and registration statements on U.S. domestic issuer forms, which are more detailed and extensive than the forms available to a foreign private issuer. We would also have to comply with U.S. federal proxy requirements, and our officers, directors and 10% shareholders would become subject to the short-swing profit disclosure and recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, we would lose our ability to rely upon exemptions from certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements. As a result, the regulatory and compliance costs to us under U.S. securities laws as a U.S. domestic issuer could be significantly higher. Our directors who have relationships with Oaktree may have conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving us. Three of our directors are affiliated with Oaktree. These persons will have fiduciary duties to us and in addition will have duties to Oaktree. In addition, under the Oaktree Shareholders Agreements, none of our officers or directors who is also an officer, director, employee or other affiliate of Oaktree or an officer, director or employee of an affiliate of Oaktree will be liable to us or our shareholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to Oaktree or its affiliates instead of us, or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to us that such person or affiliate has directed to Oaktree or its affiliates. As a result, such circumstances may entail real or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting both us and Oaktree, whose interests, in some circumstances, may be adverse to ours. In addition, as a result of Oaktrees ownership interest, conflicts of interest could arise with respect to transactions involving business dealings between us and Oaktree or their affiliates, including potential business transactions, potential acquisitions of businesses or properties, the issuance of additional securities, the payment of dividends by us and other matters. Our executive officers will not devote all of their time to our business, which may hinder our ability to operate successfully. Our executive officers participate in business activities not associated with us, including serving as members of the management teams of Oceanbulk Maritime (which is affiliated with the Pappas family), Oceanbulk Container Carriers LLC and PST Tankers LLC (which are both affiliated with Oaktree and entities controlled by the family of Mr. Petros Pappas), and are not required to work full-time on our affairs. Initially, we expect that each of our executive officers will devote a substantial portion of his/her business time to the completion of our newbuilding program and management of our Company. Our executive officers may devote less time to us than if they were not engaged in other business activities and may owe fiduciary duties to the shareholders of other companies with which they may be affiliated, including those companies listed above. In particular, we expect that the amount of time Mr. Pappas allocates to managing us will vary from time to time depending on the needs of the business and the level of strategic activity at the time. This structure may create conflicts of interest in matters involving or affecting us and our customers and it is not certain that any of these conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are dependent on our managers and their ability to hire and retain key personnel. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of our management team. For example, Mr. Pappas is integral to our business, and our success depends significantly on his abilities, industry knowledge and relationships. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our officers, and the loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition. 33 Our continued success will depend upon our and our managers ability to hire and retain key members of our management team. Difficulty in hiring and retaining personnel could adversely affect our results of operations. In crewing our vessels, we require technically skilled employees with specialized training who can perform physically demanding work. Competition to attract and retain qualified crew members is intense due to the increase in the size of the global shipping fleet. If we are not able to obtain higher charter rates to compensate for any crew cost increases, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may be unable to manage, maintain and grow our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As we expand our fleet, we will also need to expand our operational and financial systems and hire new shoreside staff and seafarers to crew our vessels; if we cannot expand these systems or recruit suitable employees, its performance may be adversely affected. Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Our Common Shares We are a holding company, and we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us in order to satisfy our financial obligations and to make dividend payments. We are a holding company and our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own all of our operating assets. We have no significant assets other than the equity interests in our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and to make dividend payments in the future depends on our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, our board of directors may exercise its discretion not to declare or pay dividends. We do not intend to obtain funds from other sources to pay dividends. Furthermore, certain of our outstanding financing arrangements restrict the ability of some of our subsidiaries (which are the parent companies of various shipowning subsidiaries) to pay us dividends under certain circumstances (such as if an event of default exists, if certain dates have not passed and/or if certain financial ratios are not met). See Note 9, Long Term Debt to our audited consolidated financial statements, for more information regarding these restrictions contained in our historical financing arrangements. To the extent we do not receive dividends from our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends will be restricted. Because we are organized under the laws of the Marshall Islands and because substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States, it may be difficult to serve us with legal process or enforce judgments against us, our directors or our management. We are organized under the laws of the Marshall Islands and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, the majority of our directors and officers are or will be non-residents of the United States and all or a substantial portion of the assets of these non-residents are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or against our directors and officers in the United States if you believe that your rights have been infringed under securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Marshall Islands and of other jurisdictions may prevent or restrict you from enforcing a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors or officers. We are incorporated in the Marshall Islands, which does not have a well-developed body of corporate law. Our corporate affairs are governed by our Third Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the Articles of Incorporation) and our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws) and by the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act (the MIBCA). The provisions of the MIBCA resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the United States. However, there have been few judicial cases in the Marshall Islands interpreting the MIBCA. The rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under the laws of the Marshall Islands are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in the United States. The rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in the Marshall Islands may differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in the United States. While the MIBCA provides that it is to be interpreted according to the laws of the State of Delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions, there have been few, if any, court cases interpreting the MIBCA in the Marshall Islands and we cannot predict whether Marshall Islands courts would reach the same conclusions as United States courts. Thus, you may have more difficulty in protecting your interests in the face of actions by the management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a United States jurisdiction that has developed a relatively more substantial body of case law. Additionally, the Republic of the Marshall Islands does not have a legal provision for bankruptcy or a general statutory mechanism for insolvency proceedings. As such, in the event of a future insolvency or bankruptcy, our shareholders and creditors may experience delays in their ability to recover their claims after any such insolvency or bankruptcy. 34 The price of our common shares may be highly volatile. The price of our common shares may fluctuate due to factors such as: • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results and those of other public companies in our industry; • mergers and strategic alliances in the dry bulk shipping industry; • market conditions in the dry bulk shipping industry; • changes in government regulation; • the failure of securities analysts to publish research about us, or shortfalls in our operating results from levels forecast by securities analysts; • announcements concerning us or our competitors; and • the general state of the securities markets. The seaborne transportation industry has been highly unpredictable and volatile. The market for our common shares in this industry may be equally volatile. Consequently, you may not be able to sell the common shares at prices equal to or greater than those paid by you. Future sales of our common shares could cause the market price of our common shares to decline. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue common shares, of which 161,691,380 shares had been issued and were outstanding as of April 6, 2015. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, may depress the market price for our common shares. These sales could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity securities in the future. We intend to issue additional shares of our common shares in the future. Our shareholders may incur dilution from any future equity offering and upon the issuance of additional shares of our common shares upon the exercise of options we grant to certain of our executive officers or upon the issuance of additional common shares pursuant to our equity incentive plan. Certain shareholders hold registration rights, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. On September 20, 2011, we filed a registration statement on Form S-8 (File No. 333-176922) that covers the resale of up to 311,006 of our common shares that have been issued under our 2007, 2010 and 2011 equity incentive plans. We have included 485,783 common shares for resale in a universal shelf registration statement (File No. 333-180674), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) on July 17, 2012. A Form F-3 registration statement for 7,731,776 common shares was filed with the SEC pursuant to a registration rights agreement and declared effective on November 12, 2013 for shares held by Oaktree and Monarch. On July 11, 2014, we entered into the Registration Rights Agreement. For more information regarding the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we filed a Form F-3 registration statement (Registration No. 333-197886), registering the resale of 67,258,287 common shares to be sold by certain selling shareholders listed therein, which was declared effective on September 25, 2014. In addition, the Registration Rights Agreement also provides the Oaktree Seller and its affiliates with certain demand registration rights and the Oaktree Seller, Pappas Seller, Monarch, Angelo, Gordon and Excel and certain affiliates thereof with certain shelf registration rights in respect of any common shares held by them (including the 29,917,312 common shares to be issued as the Excel Vessel Share Consideration and the 37,250,418 common shares purchased by Oaktree, Angelo, Gordon, Monarch and affiliates of the family of Mr. Pappas in the 2015 Equity Offering), subject to certain conditions. As a result of the Excel Transactions and pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we filed another Form F-3 registration statement (Registration No. 333-198832) registering the resale of 29,917,312 common shares to be issued to Excel as the Excel Vessel Share Consideration, and the 37,250,418 common shares purchased by Oaktree, Angelo, Gordon, Monarch and affiliates of the family of Mr. Petros Pappas in the 2015 Equity Offering. This registration statement was declared effective on February 25, 2015. In addition, in the event that we register additional common shares for sale to the public following the closing of the Transactions, we will be required to give notice to the Oaktree Seller, Pappas Seller, Monarch, Angelo, Gordon and Excel, and certain affiliates thereof of its intention to effect such registration and, subject to certain limitations, we will be required to include common shares held by those holders in such registration. The resale of these common shares in addition to the offer and sale of the other securities included in such registration statements may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. 35 Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition, or could make it difficult for our shareholders to replace or remove our current board of directors, which could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. Several provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and our Bylaws could make it difficult for our shareholders to change the composition of our board of directors in any one year, preventing them from changing the composition of management. In addition, the same provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that shareholders may consider favorable. These provisions include: • authorizing our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock without shareholder approval; • providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms; • establishing certain advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings; • prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors; • limiting the persons who may call special meetings of shareholders; • authorizing the removal of directors only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common shares entitled to vote for the directors; and • establishing supermajority voting provisions with respect to amendments to certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and our Bylaws. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public shareholders to benefit from a change in control and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of our common shares and your ability to realize any potential change of control premium. Item
