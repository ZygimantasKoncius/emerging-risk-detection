ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS A variety of factors may affect our future results and the market price of our stock. We have included certain forward-looking statements in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We may also make oral and written forward-looking statements from time to time, in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and otherwise. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The following section lists some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 26 Table of Contents We cannot predict every event and circumstance that may impact our business and, therefore, the risks and uncertainties discussed below may not be the only ones you should consider. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are in addition to those that apply to most businesses generally. In addition, as we continue to operate our business, we may encounter risks of which we are not aware at this time. These additional risks may cause serious damage to our business in the future, the impact of which we cannot estimate at this time. RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS Our markets are very competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively. The markets for our solutions are very competitive. The intensity of competition in our markets has significantly increased in part as a result of the extended period of economic downturn and uncertainty. We expect this intensity of competition to increase in the future. Our current and potential competitors may make acquisitions of other competitors and may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties. Any significant consolidation among ERP or supply chain software companies could adversely affect our competitive position. Increased competition has resulted and in the future could result in price reductions, lower gross margins, longer sales cycles and the loss of market share. Each of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition. Many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and therefore, we may be at a disadvantage in competing with them. We directly compete with other supply chain software vendors, including SAP, I2 Technologies, Lawson Software, Inc., Oracle Corporation, QAD Inc., SAP AG and others. Some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, technical and other competitive resources than we do, as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed base of clients. The ERP software market has experienced significant consolidation. This consolidation has included numerous mergers and acquisitions, including takeovers such as the Oracle/Peoplesoft transaction. As a result, some prospective buyers are experiencing reluctance in purchasing applications that could have a short lifespan due to an acquisition resulting in the applications life being abruptly cut short. In addition, increased competition and consolidation in these markets is likely to result in price reductions, reduced operating margins and changes in market share, any one of which could adversely affect us. If customers or prospects want to reduce the number of their software vendors, they may elect to purchase competing products from a larger vendor than us since those larger vendors offer a wider range of products. Furthermore, certain of these larger vendors such as Oracle Corporation may be capable of bundling their software with their database applications, which underlie a significant portion of our installed applications. When we compete with these larger vendors for new customers, we believe that these larger businesses often attempt to use their size as a competitive advantage against us. Oracle Corporations purchase of Peoplesoft, Inc., Retek Inc., and Siebel Systems, Inc., and other consolidations in the software industry, have fueled uncertainty among customer prospects. In addition, many of our competitors have well-established relationships with our current and potential clients and have extensive knowledge of our industry. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can. Some competitors have become more aggressive with their prices and payment terms and issuance of contractual implementation terms or guarantees. We may be unable to continue to compete successfully with new and existing competitors without lowering prices or offering other favorable terms. Furthermore, potential customers may consider outsourcing options, including application service providers, data center outsourcing and service bureaus as alternatives to licensing our software products. Any of these factors could materially impair our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition. 27 Table of Contents In addition, we compete with a variety of more specialized software and services vendors, including:  Internet (on demand) software vendors;  single-industry software vendors;  merging enterprise resource optimization software vendors;  human resource management software vendors;  financial management software vendors;  merchandising software vendors;  services automation software vendors; and  outsourced services providers. As a result, the market for enterprise software applications has been and continues to be intensely competitive. Some competitors are increasingly aggressive with their pricing, payment terms and/or issuance of contractual warranties, implementation terms or guarantees. Third party service companies may offer competing maintenance and implementation services to our customers and thereby reduce our opportunities to provide those services. We may be unable to continue to compete successfully with new and existing competitors without lowering prices or offering other favorable terms to customers. We expect competition to persist and intensify, which could negatively impact our operating results and market share. The continuing uncertainty in U.S. and global markets may reduce demand for our software and related services, which may negatively affect our revenues and operating results. Our revenues and profitability depend on the overall demand for our software, professional services and maintenance. Regional and global economic change and uncertainty and political instability in key geographic areas have resulted in companies reducing their spending for technology projects generally and delaying or reconsidering potential purchases of our products and related services. The uncertainty posed by the long-term effects of the war in the Middle East, terrorist activities, related uncertainties and risks, and other geopolitical issues may adversely impact the purchasing decisions of current or potential customers. Future declines in demand for our products or services could adversely affect our revenues and operating results. We are dependent upon key personnel, and need to attract and retain highly qualified personnel in all areas. Our future operating results depend significantly upon the continued service of a relatively small number of key senior management and technical personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, James C. Edenfield. None of our key personnel are bound by long-term employment agreements. The loss of Mr. Edenfield or one or more other key individuals could have an adverse effect on us. Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain other highly qualified managerial and technical personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, and we have at times experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel. We may be unable to retain our key managerial and technical employees and we may not be successful in attracting, assimilating and retaining other highly qualified managerial and technical personnel in the future. The failure to attract, train, retain and effectively manage employees could negatively impact our development and sales efforts and cause a degradation of our customer service. In particular, the loss of sales personnel could lead to lost sales opportunities because it can take several months to hire and train replacement sales personnel. If our competitors increase their use of non-compete agreements, the pool of available sales and technical personnel may further narrow in certain areas, even if the non-compete agreements ultimately prove to be unenforceable. We may grant large numbers of stock options to attract and retain personnel, which could be highly dilutive to our stockholders. The volatility or lack of positive 28 Table of Contents performance of our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. The loss of key management and technical personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on us. We periodically have restructured our sales force, which can be disruptive. We continue to rely heavily on our direct sales force. In recent years, we have restructured or made other adjustments to our sales force in response to factors such as product changes, geographical coverage and other internal considerations. Change in the structures of the sales force and sales force management can result in temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity that may affect revenues in one or more quarters. Future restructuring of our sales force could occur, and if so we may again experience the adverse transition issues associated with such restructuring. We may be required to defer recognition of license revenue for a significant period of time after entering into an agreement, which could negatively impact our results of operations. We may have to delay recognizing license revenue for a significant period of time based on a variety of factors, including:  whether the license agreement relates to then-unavailable software products;  whether transactions include both currently deliverable software products and software products that are under development or other undeliverable elements;  whether the customer demands services that include significant modifications, customizations or complex interfaces that could delay products delivery or acceptance;  whether the transaction involves acceptance criteria that may preclude revenue recognition or if there are identified product-related issues, such as known defects; and  whether the transaction involves payment terms or fees that depend upon contingencies. These factors and other specific accounting requirements under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for software revenue recognition require that we have very precise terms in our license agreements to allow us to recognize revenue when we initially deliver software or perform services. Although we have a standard form of license agreement that we believe meets the criteria under GAAP for current revenue recognition on delivered elements, we negotiate and revise these terms and conditions in many transactions. Therefore, it is possible that from time to time we may license our software or provide services with terms and conditions that do not permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed. We are dependent upon the retail industry for a significant amount of our revenues. Historically, we have a significant portion of our revenues from the license of software products and the sale of collaborative applications that address vertical market opportunities with manufacturers and wholesalers that supply retail customers. The success of our customers is directly linked to economic conditions in the retail industry, which in turn are subject to intense competitive pressures and are affected by overall economic conditions. In addition, we believe that the licensing of certain of our software products involves a large capital expenditure, which is often accompanied by large-scale hardware purchases or other capital commitments. As a result, demand for our products and services could decline in the event of instability or potential downturns in our customers industries. We believe the retail industry remains cautious in its level of investment in information technology during the difficult economic cycle of the last few years, and the uncertainty related to the threat of future terrorist 29 Table of Contents attacks and any continued conflict in Iraq. We remain concerned about weak and uncertain economic conditions, consolidations and the disappointing results of retailers in certain markets. The retail industry will be negatively impacted if weak economic conditions or fear of additional terrorist attacks and wars persist for an extended period of time. Weak and uncertain economic conditions have in the past, and may in the future, negatively impact our revenues, including potential deterioration of our maintenance revenue base as customers look to reduce their costs, elongation of our selling cycles, and reduction in the demand for our products. As a result, it is difficult in the current economic environment to predict exactly when specific software licenses will close. In addition, weak and uncertain economic conditions could impair our customers ability to pay for our products or services. Any of these factors could adversely impact our business, our quarterly or annual operating results and our financial condition. We also believe that the retail industry may be consolidating, and that the industry is currently experiencing increased competition in certain geographic regions that could negatively impact the industry and our customers ability to pay for our products and services. Such consolidation has in the past, and may in the future, negatively impact our revenues, reduce the demand for our products and may negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition. We may derive a significant portion of our revenues in any quarter from a limited number of large, non-recurring license sales. We expect to continue to experience from time to time large, individual license sales, which may cause significant variations in quarterly license fees. We also believe that purchasing our products is relatively discretionary and generally involves a significant commitment of a customers capital resources. Therefore, a downturn in any customers business could result in order cancellations that could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and quarterly results. Moreover, declines in general economic conditions could precipitate significant reductions in corporate spending for information technology, which could result in delays or cancellations of orders for our products. Our lengthy sales cycle makes it difficult to predict quarterly revenue levels and operating results. Because license and implementation fees for our software products are substantial and the decision to purchase our products typically involves members of our customers senior management, the sales process for our solutions is lengthy and can exceed one year. Accordingly, the timing of our license revenues is difficult to predict, and the delay of an order could cause our quarterly revenues to fall substantially below our expectations and those of public market analysts and investors. Moreover, to the extent that we succeed in shifting customer purchases away from individual software products and toward more costly integrated suites of software and services, our sales cycle may lengthen, which could increase the likelihood of delays and cause the effect of a delay to become more pronounced. Delays in sales could cause significant shortfalls in our revenues and operating results for any particular period. Also, it is difficult for us to forecast the timing and recognition of revenues from sales of our products because our existing and prospective customers often take significant time evaluating our products before licensing them. The period between initial customer contact and a purchase by a customer may vary from nine months to more than one year. During the evaluation period, prospective customers may decide not to purchase or may scale down proposed orders of our products for various reasons, including:  reduced demand for enterprise software solutions;  introduction of products by our competitors;  lower prices offered by our competitors;  changes in budgets and purchasing priorities; and  reduced need to upgrade existing systems. Our existing and prospective customers routinely require education regarding the use and benefits of our products. This may also lead to delays in receiving customers orders. 30 Table of Contents We derive a significant portion of our services revenues from a small number of customers. If these customers were to discontinue the usage of our services or delay their implementation our total revenues would be adversely affected. We derive a significant portion of our services revenues, and total revenues, from a small number of customers using our services for product enhancement and other optional services. If these customers were to discontinue or delay the usage of these services, or obtain these services from a competitor, our services revenues and total revenues would be adversely affected. Customers may delay or terminate implementation of our services due to budgetary constraints related to economic uncertainty, dissatisfaction with product quality, the difficulty of prioritizing a surplus of information technology projects, changes in business strategy, personnel or priorities, or for other reasons. Such customers may be less likely to invest in additional software in the future and to continue to pay for software maintenance. Since our business relies to a large extent upon sales to existing customers and since maintenance and services revenues are key elements of our revenue base, any reduction in these sales or these maintenance and services payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Services revenues carry lower gross margins than license revenues and an overall increase in services revenues as a percentage of total revenues could have an adverse impact on our business. Because service revenues have lower gross margins than license revenues, an increase in the percentage of total revenues represented by service revenues could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results. As a result, an increase in services revenues as a percentage of total revenues and a change in the mix between services that are provided by our employees versus services provided by third-party consultants may negatively affect our gross margins. If our customers elect not to renew maintenance contracts after the initial maintenance period, and the loss of those customers is not offset by new maintenance customers, our maintenance revenues and total revenues would be adversely affected. Upon the purchase of a software license, our customers typically enter into a maintenance contract with a term from approximately one to three years. If, after this initial maintenance period, customers elect not to renew their maintenance contracts, and we do not offset the loss of those customers by new maintenance customers as a result of new license fees, our maintenance revenues and total revenues would be adversely affected. We may not be successful in convincing customers to migrate to current or future releases of our products, which may lead to reduced services and maintenance revenues and less future business from existing customers. Our customers may not be willing to incur the costs or invest the resources necessary to complete upgrades to current or future releases of our products. This may lead to our loss of services and maintenance revenues and future business from customers that continue to operate prior versions of our products or choose to no longer use our products. We may change our pricing practices, which could adversely impact operating margins or customer ordering patterns. The intensely competitive markets in which we compete can put pressure on us to reduce our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other products or services, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. For these and other reasons, in the future, we may choose to make changes to our pricing practices. For example, we may (i) offer additional discounts to customers, (ii) increase (or decrease) the use of pricing that involves periodic fees based on the number of users of a product, or (iii) change maintenance pricing. Such changes could reduce margins or inhibit our ability to sell our products. 31 Table of Contents If accounting interpretations relating to revenue recognition change or companies we acquire have applied such standards differently than we do or have not applied them at all, our reported revenues could decline or we could be forced to make changes in our business practices or we may incur the expense and risks associated with an audit or restatement of the acquired companys financial statements. There are several accounting standards and interpretations covering revenue recognition for the software industry. These pronouncements include Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, and SOP 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff has issued Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 101 and 104, which explain how the SEC staff believes existing revenue recognition rules should be applied to or interpreted for transactions not addressed by existing rules. These standards address software revenue recognition matters primarily from a conceptual level and do not include specific implementation guidance. We believe that we currently comply with these standards. The accounting profession and regulatory agencies continue to discuss various provisions of these pronouncements with the objective of providing additional guidance on their application and with respect to potential interpretations related to so-called multiple element arrangements in which a single contract includes a software license, a maintenance services agreement or other elements that are bundled together in a total offering to the customer. These discussions and the issuance of new interpretations, once finalized, could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices, which could change the timing of recognized revenue. They could also drive significant adjustments to our business practices which could result in increased administrative costs, lengthened sales cycles and other changes which could adversely affect our reported revenues and results of operations. In addition, companies we acquire may have historically interpreted software revenue recognition rules differently than we do or may not have been subject to US GAAP as a result of reporting under local GAAP in a foreign country. If we discover that companies we have acquired have interpreted and applied software revenue recognition rules differently than prescribed by US GAAP, we could be required to devote significant management resources, and incur the expense associated with an audit, restatement or other examination of the acquired companies financial statements. Serious harm to our business could result if our encryption technology fails to ensure the security of our customers online transactions. The secure exchange of confidential information over public networks is a significant concern of consumers engaging in on-line transactions and interaction. Some of our software applications use encryption technology to provide the security necessary to affect the secure exchange of valuable and confidential information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that these applications use to protect customer transaction data. If any compromise or breach were to occur, it could have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If our customers lose confidence in the security of data on the Internet, our revenues could be adversely affected. Maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is an issue of critical importance for our customers. Attempts by experienced computer programmers, or hackers, to penetrate client network security or the security of web sites to misappropriate confidential information are currently an industry-wide phenomenon that affects computers and networks across all platforms. Despite efforts to address these risks, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products (or the Internet in general) could lead some customers to seek to reduce or delay future purchases or to purchase competitors products which are not Internet-based applications. Customers may also increase their spending to protect their computer networks from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. Any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenues. 32 Table of Contents We depend on third-party technology which, if it should become unavailable or if it contains defects, could result in increased costs or delays in the production and improvement of our products. We license critical third-party software products that we incorporate into our own software products. We are likely to incorporate and include additional third-party software into and with our products and solutions as we expand our product offerings. If our relations with any of these third-party software providers are impaired, and if we are unable to obtain or develop a replacement for the software, our business could be harmed. The operation of our products would be impaired if errors occur in the third-party software that we utilize. It may be more difficult for us to correct any defects in third-party software because the software is not within our control. Accordingly, our business could be adversely affected in the event of any errors in this software. There can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the capabilities of their software. If the cost of licensing any of these third-party software products significantly increases, our gross margin levels could significantly decrease. Our future growth depends upon our ability to develop and sustain relationships with complementary vendors to market and implement our software products, and failure to develop and sustain these relationships could have a material adverse affect on our operating performance and financial condition. We are developing, maintaining and enhancing significant working relationships with complementary vendors, such as software companies, consulting firms, resellers and others that we believe can play important roles in marketing our products and solutions. We are currently investing, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources to develop and enhance these relationships, which could adversely affect our operating margins. We may be unable to develop relationships with organizations that will be able to market our products effectively. Our arrangements with these organizations are not exclusive and, in many cases, may be terminated by either party without cause. Many of the organizations with which we are developing or maintaining marketing relationships have commercial relationships with our competitors. There can be no assurance that any organization will continue its involvement with us and our products. The loss of relationships with important organizations could materially and adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition. We may be unable to retain or attract customers if we do not develop new products and enhance our current products in response to technological changes and competing products. As a software company, we have been required to migrate our products and services from mainframe to customer-server to web-based environments. In addition, we have been required to adapt our products to emerging standards for operating systems, databases and other technologies. We will be unable to compete effectively if we are unable to:  maintain and enhance our technological capabilities to correspond to these emerging environments and standards;  develop and market products and services that meet changing customer needs; or  anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis. A substantial portion of our research and development resources is devoted to product upgrades that address regulatory and support requirements. Only the remainder of our limited research and development resources is available for new products. New products require significant development investment. That investment is further constrained because of the added costs of developing new products that work with multiple operating systems or databases. We face uncertainty when we develop or acquire new products because there is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop for those products. If we do not attract sufficient customer interest in those products, we will not realize a return on our investment and our operating results will be adversely affected. Our core products face competition from new or revised technologies that may render our existing technology less competitive or obsolete, reducing the demand for our products. As a result, we must continually 33 Table of Contents redesign our products to incorporate these new technologies and to adapt our software products to operate on, and comply with evolving industry standards for hardware and software platforms. Maintaining and upgrading our products to operate on multiple hardware and database platforms reduces our resources for developing new products. Because of the increased costs of developing and supporting software products across multiple platforms, we may need to reduce the number of those platforms. In addition, conflicting new technologies present us with difficult choices of which new technologies to adopt. If we fail to anticipate the most popular platforms or fail to respond adequately to technological developments, or experience significant delays in product development or introduction, our business and operating results will be negatively impacted. In addition, to the extent we determine that new technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive, the development, acquisition and implementation of such technologies may require us to make significant capital investments. We may not be able to obtain capital for these purposes and investments in new technologies may not result in commercially viable technological products. The loss of revenue and increased costs to us from such changing technologies would adversely affect our business and operating results. If our products are not able to deliver quick, demonstrable value to our customers, our business could be seriously harmed. Enterprises are requiring their application software vendors to provide faster times for a return of their investments on their technology investments. We must continue to improve the speed of our implementations and the pace at which our products deliver value or our competitors may gain important strategic advantages over us. If we cannot successfully respond to these market demands, or if our competitors respond more successfully than we do, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. If we do not maintain software performance across accepted platforms and operating environments, our license and services revenue could be adversely affected. The markets for our software products are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. We continuously evaluate new technologies and implement into our products advanced technology. However, if in our product development efforts we fail to accurately address, in a timely manner, evolving industry standards, new technology advancements or important third-party interfaces or product architectures, sales of our products and services will suffer. Market acceptance of new platforms and operating environments may require us to undergo the expense of developing and maintaining compatible product lines. We can license our software products for use with a variety of popular industry standard relational database management system platforms using different programming languages and underlying databases and architectures. There may be future or existing relational database platforms that achieve popularity in the marketplace and that may or may not be architecturally compatible with our software product design. In addition, the effort and expense of developing, testing, and maintaining software product lines will increase as more hardware platforms and operating systems achieve market acceptance within our target markets. Moreover, future or existing user interfaces that achieve popularity within the business application marketplace may or may not be architecturally compatible with our current software product design. If we do not achieve market acceptance of new user interfaces that we support, or adapt to popular new user interfaces that we do not support, our sales and revenue may be adversely affected. Developing and maintaining consistent software product performance characteristics across all of these combinations could place a significant strain on our resources and software product release schedules, which could adversely affect revenues and results of operations. We currently do not compete in the software on demand or application service provider markets. Some businesses choose to access enterprise software applications through hosted on demand services or application service providers who distribute enterprise software through a hosted subscription service. We do not 34 Table of Contents currently have our own on demand hosting program for our products and have had limited success with channel partners who serve as application service providers for customers. If these alternative distribution models gain popularity, we may not be able to compete effectively in this environment. Our software products and product development are complex, which make it increasingly difficult to innovate, extend our product offerings, and avoid costs related to correction of program errors. The market for our software products is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. For instance, existing products can become obsolete and unmarketable when vendors introduce products utilizing new technologies or new industry standards emerge. As a result, it is difficult for us to estimate the life cycles of our software products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new products to the market in a timely and cost-effective manner, or that products, capabilities or technologies developed by our competitors will not render our products obsolete. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to:  continue to enhance and expand our core applications;  continue to sell our products;  continue to successfully integrate third-party products;  enter new markets and achieve market acceptance; and  develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments, including developments related to the Internet, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance. Despite testing by us, our software programs, like all software programs generally, may contain a number of undetected errors or bugs when we first introduce them or as new versions are released. We do not discover some errors until we have installed the product and our customers have used it. Errors may result in the delay or loss of revenues, diversion of software engineering resources, material non-monetary concessions, negative media attention, or increased service or warranty costs as a result of performance or warranty claims could lead to customer dissatisfaction, resulting in litigation, damage to our reputation, and impaired demand for our products. Correcting bugs may result in increased costs and reduced acceptance of our software products in the marketplace. The effort and expense of developing, testing and maintaining software product lines will increase with the increasing number of possible combinations of:  vendor hardware platforms;  operating systems and updated versions;  application software products and updated versions; and  database management system platforms and updated versions Developing consistent software product performance characteristics across all of these combinations could place a significant strain on our development resources and software product release schedules. If the open source community expands into enterprise application software, our license fee revenues may decline. The open source community is comprised of many different formal and informal groups of software developers and individuals who have created a wide variety of software and have made that software available for use, distribution and modification, often free of charge. Open source software, such as the Linux operating system, has been gaining in popularity among business users. If developers contribute enterprise application software to the open source community, and that software has competitive features and scale to support business 35 Table of Contents users in our markets, we will need to change our product pricing and distribution strategy to compete successfully. Implementation of our products can be complex, time-consuming and expensive; customers may be unable to implement our products successfully and we may become subject to warranty or product liability claims, which could be costly to resolve and result in negative publicity. Our products must integrate with the many existing computer systems and software programs of our customers. This can be complex, time-consuming and expensive, and may cause delays in the deployment of our products. Our customers may be unable to implement our products successfully or otherwise achieve the benefits attributable to our products. Although we test each of our new products and product enhancement releases and evaluate and test the products we obtain through acquisitions before introducing them to the market, there may still be significant errors in existing or future releases of our software products, with the possible result that we may be required to expend significant resources in order to correct such errors or otherwise satisfy customer demands. In addition, defects in our products or difficulty integrating our products with our customers systems could result in delayed or lost revenues, warranty or other claims against us by customers or third parties, adverse customer reaction and negative publicity about us or our products and services or reduced acceptance of our products and services in the marketplace, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure to maintain our margins and service rates for implementation services could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition. A significant portion of our revenues is derived from implementation services. If we fail to scope our implementation projects correctly, our services margins may suffer. Implementation services are predominately billed on an hourly or daily basis (time and materials) and sometimes under fixed price contracts. Implementation services billed on an hourly or daily basis and we generally recognize revenue from those services as work is performed. If we are not able to maintain the current service rates for our time and materials implementation services, without corresponding cost reductions, or if the percentage of fixed price contracts increases and we underestimate the costs of our fixed price contracts, our operating performance may suffer. The rates we charge for our implementation services depend on a number of factors, including the following:  perceptions of our ability to add value through our implementation services;  complexity of services performed;  competition;  pricing policies of our competitors and of systems integrators;  the use of globally sourced, lower-cost service delivery capabilities within our industry; and  economic, political and market conditions. An increase in sales of software products that require customization would result in revenue being recognized over the term of the contract for those products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition. Historically, we have been able to recognize software license revenue upon delivery of our solutions and contract execution. Recently, more of our customers and prospects have been asking for unique capabilities in addition to our core capabilities to give them a competitive edge in the market place. These instances could cause us to recognize more of our software license revenue on a contract accounting basis over the course of the delivery of the solution rather than upon delivery and contract execution. The period between initial contact and the completion of the implementation of our products can be lengthy and is subject to a number of factors (over many of which of which we have little or no control) that may cause significant delays. These factors include the 36 Table of Contents size and complexity of the overall project. As a result, a shift toward a higher proportion of software license contracts requiring contract accounting would have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition and cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. We sometimes experience delays in product releases, which can adversely affect our business. Historically, we have issued significant new releases of our software products periodically, with minor interim releases issued more frequently. As a result of the complexities inherent in our software, major new product enhancements and new products often require long development and testing periods before they are released. On occasion, we have experienced delays in the scheduled release date of new or enhanced products, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve future scheduled release dates. The delay of product releases or enhancements, or the failure of such products or enhancements to achieve market acceptance, could materially affect our business and reputation. We may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years. Developing and localizing software is expensive, and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle. Our future plans include significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all. Our past and future acquisitions may not be successful and we may have difficulty integrating acquisitions. We continually evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, products and technologies. We have in the past acquired and invested, and may continue to acquire or invest, in complementary companies, products and technologies, and enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies. Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and investments present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction. Risks commonly encountered in such transactions include:  the risk that the acquired company or assets may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the company or assets were worth;  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and retaining and motivating personnel of the combined companies;  the risk that we may not be able to integrate the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies;  the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the diversion of our managements attention from other business concerns;  the inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful integration of acquired businesses;  adverse impact on our annual effective tax rate;  dilution of existing equity holders caused by capital stock issuances to the stockholders of acquired companies or stock option grants to retain employees of the acquired companies;  difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies;  potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products; 37 Table of Contents  the impairment of relationships with employees and customers;  potential assumption of liabilities of our acquisition targets;  significant exit or impairment charges if products acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful; and  issues with product quality, product architecture, legal contingencies, product development issues, or other significant issues that may not be detected through our due diligence process. Recent changes in the law require the use of the purchase method of accounting in all new business acquisitions. The purchase method of accounting for business combinations may require large write-offs of any in-process research and development costs related to companies being acquired, as well as ongoing amortization costs for other intangible assets valued in combinations of companies. In addition, we will need to periodically measure goodwill for impairment that may result in large future write-offs. Such write-offs and ongoing amortization charges may have a significant negative impact on operating margins and net earnings in the quarter of the combination and for several subsequent years. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with such transactions. There may be an increase in customer bankruptcies due to weak economic conditions. We have in the past and may in the future be impacted by customer bankruptcies that occur in periods subsequent to the software license sale. During weak economic conditions there is an increased risk that some of our customers will file bankruptcy. When our customers file bankruptcy, we may be required to forego collection of pre-petition amounts owed and to repay amounts remitted to us during the 90-day preference period preceding the filing. Accounts receivable balances related to pre-petition amounts may in some of these instances be large due to extended payment terms for software license fees, and significant billings for consulting and implementation services on large projects. The bankruptcy laws, as well as the specific circumstances of each bankruptcy, may severely limit our ability to collect pre-petition amounts, and may force us to disgorge payments made during the 90-day preference period. We also face risk from international customers that file for bankruptcy protection in foreign jurisdictions, in that the application of foreign bankruptcy laws may be more difficult to predict. Although we believe that we have sufficient reserves to cover anticipated customer bankruptcies, there can be no assurance that such reserves will be adequate, and if they are not adequate, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. Our international operations and sales subject us to risks associated with unexpected activities outside of the United States. The global reach of our business could cause us to be subject to unexpected, uncontrollable and rapidly changing events and circumstances in addition to those experienced in locations within the United States. The following factors, among others, could have an adverse impact on our business and earnings:  failure to properly comply with foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign activities including, without limitation, software localization requirements;  failure to properly comply with U.S. laws and regulations relating to the export of our products and services;  compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulations in Europe, Asia and North America, including export requirements, tariffs, import duties and other trade barriers, as well as health and safety requirements;  difficulties in managing foreign operations and appropriate levels of staffing;  longer collection cycles;  tariffs and other trade barriers; 38 Table of Contents  seasonal reductions in business activities, particularly throughout Europe;  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;  proper compliance with local tax laws which can be complex and may result in unintended adverse tax consequences;  anti-American sentiment due to the war with Iraq and other American policies that may be unpopular in certain countries;  increasing political instability, adverse economic conditions and the potential for war or other hostilities in many of these countries;  difficulties in enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems;  fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided by us in foreign markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency;  changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate.  potential labor strikes, lockouts, work slowdowns and work stoppages at U.S. and international ports; and  restrictions on downsizing operations in Europe and expenses and delays associated with any such activities. It may become increasingly expensive to obtain and maintain liability insurance. We contract for insurance to cover a variety of potential risks and liabilities. In the current market, insurance coverage is becoming more restrictive, and when insurance coverage is offered, the deductible for which we are responsible is larger. In light of these circumstances, it may become more difficult to maintain insurance coverage at historical levels, or if such coverage is available, the cost to obtain or maintain it may increase substantially. This may result in our being forced to bear the burden of an increased portion of risks for which we have traditionally been covered by insurance, which could negatively impact our results of operations. We have limited protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights and may potentially infringe third-party intellectual property rights. We consider certain aspects of our internal operations, software and documentation to be proprietary, and rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws; confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties; and protective contractual provisions such as those contained in our license agreements with consultants, vendors, partners and customers and other measures to protect this information. Existing copyright laws afford only limited protection. We believe that the rapid pace of technological change in the computer software industry has made trade secret and copyright protection less significant than factors such as:  knowledge, ability and experience of our employees;  frequent software product enhancements;  customer education; and  timeliness and quality of support services. Our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. The laws of some countries in which our software products are or may be licensed do not protect our software products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. 39 Table of Contents We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, consultants, and vendors. These agreements control access to and distribution of our software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products, obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary, or develop similar technology through reverse engineering or other means. Preventing or detecting unauthorized use of our products is difficult. There can be no assurances that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our license agreements will be enforceable. In addition, we may resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of others proprietary rights, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity in the future. Such litigation could result in significant costs or the diversion of resources. This could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us. Although we do not believe that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not assert or prosecute infringement or invalidity claims against us. These assertions could distract management, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, and could result in costly and time consuming litigation, including damage awards. Such assertions or defense of such claims may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. In addition, such assertions could result in injunctions against us. Injunctions that prevent us from distributing our products would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. If third parties assert such claims against us, we may seek to obtain a license to use such intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that such a license would be available on commercially reasonable terms. We may experience liability claims arising out of the licensing of our software and provision of services. Our agreements normally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims. However, these provisions could be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal, state, local or foreign laws or ordinances. For example, we may not be able to avoid or limit liability for disputes relating to product performance or the provision of services. If a claim against us were to be successful, we may be required to incur significant expense and pay substantial damages. Even if we prevailed, the accompanying publicity could adversely impact the demand for our products and services. We also rely on certain technology that we license from third parties, including software that is integrated with our internally developed software. Although these third parties generally indemnify us against claims that their technology infringes on the proprietary rights of others, such indemnification is not always available for all types of intellectual property. Often such third-party indemnifiers are not well capitalized and may not be able to indemnify us in the event that their technology infringes on the proprietary rights of others. As a result, we may face substantial exposure in the event that technology we license from a third-party infringes on another partys proprietary rights. Defending such infringement claims, regardless of their validity, could result in significant cost and diversion of resources. Concerns that our products do not adequately protect the privacy of consumers could inhibit sales of our products. One of the features of our software applications is the ability to develop and maintain profiles of customers for use by businesses. Typically, these products capture profile information when customers and employees visit an Internet web site and volunteer information in response to survey questions concerning their backgrounds, interests and preferences. Our products augment these profiles over time by collecting usage data. Although we have designed our products to operate with applications that protect user privacy, privacy concerns may nevertheless cause visitors to resist providing the personal data necessary to support this profiling capability. If we cannot adequately address customers privacy concerns, these concerns could seriously harm our business, financial condition and operating results. 40 Table of Contents We face risks associated with the security of our products. We have included security features in certain of our Internet browser-enabled products that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of customer data. Despite these security features, our products may be vulnerable to break-ins and similar problems caused by Internet users. Such break-ins and other disruptions could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through the computer systems of our customers. Break-ins include such things as hackers bypassing firewalls and accessing confidential information. Addressing problems caused by such break-ins may have a material adverse effect on our business. Although our license agreements with our customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure as a result of the defects listed above, such provisions may not be effective. Existing or future Federal, state, or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions could affect their enforceability. To date, we have not experienced any such product liability claims, but there can be no assurance that this will not occur in the future. Because our products are used in essential business applications, a successful product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Additionally, defending such a suit, regardless of its merits, could entail substantial expense and require the time and attention of key management. We may choose to change our business practices or our earnings will likely be affected as a result of changes in the requirements relating to the recent accounting pronouncement requiring expensing of equity instruments issued to employees. Generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the implementation of a new accounting principle. We currently account for stock options in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and accordingly, we only record compensation expense related to stock options if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock option on the date of grant. On December 16, 2004, the FASB published FASB Statement No. 123(R) Share-Based Payment (FAS 123(R)) which was to be effective for public companies in periods beginning after June 15, 2005. On April 14, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced the adoption of a new rule that amends the compliance dates for FAS 123(R). The provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) require us to value equity instruments issued to employees and liability-classified awards at grant date fair value or based upon certain valuation methods that approximate grant date fair value, and to record those values as compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations. We will be required to implement FAS 123(R) beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Our earnings in fiscal 2007 will likely be significantly reduced as a result of changing our accounting policy in accordance with FAS 123(R). As a result, we could decide to reduce the number of stock options granted to employees or to grant options to fewer employees. This could affect our ability to retain existing employees or attract qualified candidates, and increase the cash compensation we pay to employees. Such a change could have a material effect on our operating performance. Growth in our operations could increase demands on our managerial and operational resources. If the scope of our operating and financial systems and the geographic distribution of our operations and customers increase dramatically, it may increase demands on our management and operations. Our officers and other key employees will need to implement and improve our operational, customer support and financial control systems and effectively expand, train and manage our employee base. 41 Table of Contents Further, we may be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other third parties. We may not be able to manage future expansion successfully, and our inability to do so could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Our business is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance. Because our common stock and the common stock of our subsidiary, Logility, are publicly traded, we and Logility are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ, have recently issued new requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted recently by Congress, most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. In particular, our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firms audit of that assessment have required, and continue to require, the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If in the future we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of the end of the then current fiscal year (or, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our managements report is fairly stated or they it is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting), we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have a negative market reaction It may become increasingly expensive to obtain and maintain insurance. We obtain insurance to cover a variety of potential risks and liabilities. In the current market, insurance coverage has become more restrictive, and when insurance coverage is offered, the deductible for which we are responsible is larger and premiums have increased substantially. As a result, it may become more difficult to maintain insurance coverage at historical levels, or if such coverage is available, the cost to obtain or maintain it may increase substantially. This may result in our being forced to bear the burden of an increased portion of risks for which we have traditionally been covered by insurance, which could have a material effect on our operating performance and financial condition. RISKS RELATED TO OUR STOCK PRICE We could experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results that could adversely impact our stock price. It is difficult to predict our revenues and operating results, which have varied widely from quarter to quarter in the past. We expect they will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. We base our expense levels, operating costs and hiring plans on projections of future revenues, and it is difficult for us to rapidly adjust when actual results do not match our projections. A failure to meet expectations of revenues could adversely affect the price of our stock. License revenues in any quarter depend substantially on the combined contracting activity of the American Software group of companies and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue 42 Table of Contents recognition policies. Our contracting activity is difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons, including the following:  we complete a significant portion of our license agreements within the last few weeks of each quarter;  our sales cycle is relatively long and variable because of the complex and mission-critical nature of our products;  the size of our license transactions can vary significantly;  the possibility of adverse global political conditions and economic downturns, both domestic and international, characterized by decreased product demand, price erosion, technological shifts, work slowdowns and layoffs, may substantially reduce customer demand and contracting activity;  customers may unexpectedly postpone or cancel anticipated system replacement or new system evaluations and implementation due to changes in their strategic priorities, project objectives, budgetary constraints, internal purchasing processes or company management;  customer evaluations and purchasing processes vary from company to company, and a customers internal approval and expenditure authorization process can be difficult and time consuming, even after selection of a vendor; and  the number, timing and significance of software product enhancements and new software product announcements by us and by our competitors may affect purchase decisions. Variances or slowdowns in our licensing activity in prior quarters may affect current and future consulting, training and maintenance revenues since these revenues typically follow license fee revenues. Our ability to maintain or increase services revenues primarily depends on our ability to increase the number and size of our licensing agreements. In addition, we base our budgeted operating costs and hiring plans primarily on our projections of future revenues. Because our expense levels are relatively fixed in the near term, if our actual revenues fall below projections in any particular quarter, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our stock price is volatile and there is a risk of litigation. The trading price of our common stock has in the past and may in the future be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following:  revenue or results of operations in any quarter failing to meet the expectations, published or otherwise, of the investment community;  reduced investor confidence in equity markets, due in part to corporate collapses in recent years;  speculation in the press or analyst community;  wide fluctuations in stock prices, particularly with respect to the stock prices for other technology companies;  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;  new products or the acquisition of significant customers by us or our competitors;  developments with respect to our copyrights or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;  changes in interest rates;  changes in investors beliefs as to the appropriate price-earnings ratios for us and our competitors;  changes in recommendations or financial estimates by securities analysts who track our common stock or the stock of other software companies; 43 Table of Contents  changes in management;  sales of common stock by our controlling stockholders, directors and executive officers;  rumors or dissemination of false or misleading information, particularly through Internet chat rooms, instant messaging, and other rapid-dissemination methods;  conditions and trends in the software industry generally;  the announcement of acquisitions or other significant transactions by us or our competitors;  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry;  general market conditions;  domestic or international terrorism and other factors; and  the other factors described in these Risk Factors. Fluctuations in the price of our common stock may expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits. Although no such lawsuits are currently pending against us and we are not aware that any such lawsuit is threatened to be filed in the future, there is no assurance that we will not be sued based on fluctuations in the price of our common stock. Defending against such suits could result in substantial cost and divert managements attention and resources. In addition, any settlement or adverse determination of such lawsuits could subject us to significant liability. Our principal shareholders may control our management decisions. James C. Edenfield, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Thomas L. Newberry, Chairman of the Board of Directors, own 100% of our outstanding Class B common stock between them, giving them the right to elect a majority of the Board of Directors. Mr. Edenfield and Dr. Newberry have reported in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that they constitute a group, for voting purposes. Current directors and executive officers as a group beneficially own approximately 7.4% of our Class A common stock. Mr. Edenfield, Dr. Newberry and members of their immediate families currently constitute four of the eight members of the Board and, thus, have significant influence in directing the actions of the Board of Directors and all other matters requiring approval by shareholders, including the approval of mergers and other business combinations. Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Current directors and executive officers of the Company as a group beneficially own approximately 7.4% of our Class A common stock as of June 30, 2006. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by these persons, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Both the Company and our subsidiary, Logility, are controlled companies within the meaning of NASDAQ rules and, as a result, qualifies for, and relies on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Because the Company is controlled by its Class B shareholders who act as a group, and the Company controls a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Logility, both the Company and Logility are controlled companies within the meaning of the rules governing companies with stock quoted on The NASDAQ National Market. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company is a controlled company and is exempt from certain corporate governance requirements, including requirements that (1) a majority of the board of directors consist of 44 Table of Contents independent directors, (2) compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and (3) director nominees be selected or recommended for selection by a majority of the independent directors or by a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors. The Companys and Logilitys Boards of Directors do not have a majority of independent directors, and their compensation committees are not required to consist entirely of independent directors. Neither the Company Board nor the Logility Board is required to have a nominating committee, and they have not chosen to establish nominating committees. According, the procedures for approving significant corporate decisions for the Company and for Logility are not subject to the same corporate governance requirements as non-controlled companies with stock quoted on The NASDAQ National Market.
