Item 1A. Risk FactorsAn investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Included below are risk factors arising from our recent Merger with Westwood, which closed on October 21, 2011. The risk factors below should be read in conjunction with other information contained in this report as our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these risks actually occur.Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryWe have significantly increased the amount of our indebtedness and have limited liquidity, which could adversely affect our operations, flexibility in running our business and our ability to service our debt if our future operating performance does not meet our financial projections. After the Merger, we have a $155,000 First Lien Credit Agreement; an $85,000 Second Lien Credit Agreement, and a $25,000 revolving credit facility under which $4,600 has been drawn as of December 31, 2011 (collectively our "New Credit Facilities") (not including $2,020 in letters of credit used as security on various leased properties and issued thereunder as of December 31, 2011). We also have $30,000 in aggregate principal amount of PIK Notes outstanding (with additional accrued PIK interest of $875), giving us a total of $264,217 of indebtedness, net of original issue discount of $11,258, as of December 31, 2011. Our ability to service our debt for the next twelve months will depend on our financial performance in an uncertain and unpredictable economic environment, competitive pressures and most significantly, our ability to achieve the cost-savings/synergies predicted as a part of the integration of the companies, which synergies are significant. Also, as was the case with our former indebtedness, our New Credit Facilities include substantial non-financial covenants, including one that restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness beyond certain minimum baskets. If our operating results decline and we do not meet our financial projections, and we are unable to obtain a waiver to increase our indebtedness and/or successfully raise funds through an issuance of equity, we would lack sufficient liquidity to operate our business in the ordinary course, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were then unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations under our New Credit Facilities, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our New Credit Facilities, which if uncured, would allow our lenders to declare all outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable and materially impair our financial condition and liquidity.We have a history of losses from continuing operations and there can be no assurance that our performance will improve, even after taking into account our Merger with Westwood, which had a history of operating losses. If we were to incur operating losses, we could lack sufficient funds to continue to operate our business in the ordinary course.Our operating results have been significantly affected by the economic downturn that commenced in 2008. During the economic downturn, advertisers and the agencies that represent them increased pressure on advertising rates, and in some cases, requested steep percentage discounts on ad buys, demanded increased levels of inventory, re-negotiated booked orders and released advertising funds as late as possible in the cycle. Although the economy has shown signs of improvement, the overall economic recovery, especially in the advertising marketplace, has been slower. Advertisers' demands and advertising budgets have not improved to pre-recession levels, and we cannot provide any assurance as to whether we will be able to continue to increase our operating performance. If a double-dip recession were to occur or if we do not generate advertising revenue to meet our projections, our financial position could worsen to the point where we would lack sufficient liquidity to continue to operate our business in the ordinary course. The cost of our indebtedness is substantial, which further affects our liquidity and could limit our ability to implement our business plan.As described above, after the Merger, we have a $155,000 First Lien Credit Agreement which currently bears interest at a variable rate of 8.0% per annum; an $85,000 Second Lien Credit Agreement which currently bears interest at a variable rate of 13.0% per annum, $30,000 in aggregate principal amount of PIK Notes outstanding which bear interest at 15.0% per annum and a $25,000 revolving credit facility under which $4,600 is drawn (not including $2,020 in letters of credit as of December 31, 2011) and currently bears interest at a variable rate of 8.75% per annum. As a result at current interest rates, the average annual interest expense on our current debt over the next four years is approximately $34,000 per year (compared to approximately $23,200 in interest expense in 2011 for our long-term debt, excluding prepayment penalties and accelerated amortization of deferred costs). Further, the interest on our debt that is variable such that at December 31, 2011, if interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points, annualized interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately $1,220 ($740 after tax), based on our exposure to interest rate changes on debt that is not covered by swaps. As required by the terms of the First Lien Credit Agreement, 8Table of Contentswe will pay down $3,875, $7,750, $11,625, and $15,500 of our first lien debt during 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, beginning in 2013 (within 5 business days of the delivery of our 2012 annual financial statements), under First Lien Credit Agreement, we will be required to pay down an amount equal to (x) 75% of the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the agreement) for the preceding fiscal year less (y) any voluntary (optional) prepayments during such fiscal year or voluntary prepayments of revolving loans and swing loans during such fiscal year to the extent the such loans were permanently and concurrently reduced thereby. If the economy does not continue to improve and if advertisers continue to maintain reduced budgets, if our financial results continue to come under pressure, or the variable interest rates on our debt increase, we may be required to delay the implementation or reduce the scope of our business plan and our ability to develop or enhance our services or programs will likely be impacted. Without additional revenue, we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities or securing rights to name-brand or popular programming (or developing new services), or respond to competitive pressures. If any of the foregoing should occur, this could have a material and adverse effect on our business.If our operating results do not achieve our financial projections, we may require additional funding, which if not obtained, would have a material and adverse effect on our business continuity and our financial condition.We are operating in an uncertain economic environment, where the pace of an advertising recovery is unclear and we are facing increased cost pressures as described above. We have approximately $264,217 in outstanding in indebtedness, as described above. If our operating results fall short of our financial projections, we may need additional funds. If further financing is limited or unavailable to us or if we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, these conditions could require us to curtail our business activities or increase our cost of financing, both of which could reduce our profitability or increase our losses. If we were to require additional financing, which could not then be obtained, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and on our ability to meet our obligations.The nature of the news talk format in network radio programming means our advertisers' commercials may air in or adjacent to programming that is not owned or represented by us, and, as demonstrated by recent events, may be sufficiently controversial that advertisers do not want to be associated with it or with news talk programming at all, which could ultimately have a material impact on our advertising revenue. Recent events surrounding a nationally syndicated talk personality employed by another company have created issues in news talk formats (like those provided by us) as certain ads by advertisers, not included in controversial programming, have become associated with such controversial talk programming as a result of their proximity to the broadcast. While these events have prompted us to review our internal systems and procedures to determine if processes exist that would allow us to better separate our advertisers' ads from certain controversial programming, such a process will take some time to fully develop and even if developed, advertisers may decide to exit news talk programming altogether. If advertisers in talk radio programming such as ours, reduce their advertising budgets with us as a result of recent events, this could have an adverse effect on our revenue, which if material, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.CBS Radio provides us with a significant portion of our commercial inventory and audience that we sell to advertisers. A material reduction in the audience delivered by CBS Radio stations or a material loss of commercial inventory from CBS Radio would have an adverse effect on our advertising sales and financial results.While we provide programming to all major radio station groups, we have affiliation agreements with most of CBS Radio's owned and operated radio stations which, in the aggregate, provide us with a significant portion of the audience and commercial inventory that we sell to advertisers, much of which is in the more desirable top 10 radio markets. Although the compensation we pay to CBS Radio under our arrangement is adjustable based on the audience levels and commercial clearance it delivers (i.e., the percentage of commercial inventory broadcast by CBS Radio stations), any significant loss of audience or inventory delivered by CBS Radio stations, including, by way of example only, as a result of a decline in station audience, commercial clearance levels or station sales that resulted in lower audience levels, would have a material adverse impact on our advertising sales and revenue. There can be no assurance that CBS Radio will maintain audience and clearance levels and these higher levels mean our station compensation payable to CBS Radio has been significantly increased. While our arrangement with CBS Radio is scheduled to continue through 2017, there can be no assurance that such arrangement will not be breached by either party prior to 2017. If our agreement with CBS Radio were terminated as a result of such breach, our results of operations could be materially impacted. Our business is subject to increased competition from new entrants into our business, consolidated companies and new technologies/platforms, each of which has the potential to adversely affect our business.Our business operates in a highly competitive environment. Our radio programming competes for audiences and advertising revenue directly with radio stations and other syndicated programming. We also compete for advertising dollars with other media such as television, satellite radio, Internet radio, newspapers, magazines, cable television, outdoor advertising, direct mail and, 9Table of Contentsincreasingly, digital media. While the overall radio audience has remained stable, these new media platforms have gained an increased share of advertising dollars and their introduction could lead to decreasing revenue for traditional media. Additionally, new or existing competitors may have resources significantly greater than our own. In particular, the consolidation of the radio industry has created opportunities for large radio groups, such as Clear Channel Communications, CBS Radio and Cumulus Media to gather information and produce radio programming on their own. If other content companies were to merge with companies with a distribution network, the demand for our programming could decrease if those content providers elect to broadcast more of their programming on their owned and operated radio stations instead of on stations affiliated with external radio networks, such as our network. While we believe that our recent Merger has provided us with a broader, more robust and more diverse range of programming and services, we do not own and operate radio stations, while each of the aforementioned competitors do, which provides them with a built-in distribution network for their programs and products. As a result, the Merger may not necessarily translate into our ability to increase our programming, services, ratings, reach or advertising revenue, particularly if we are unable to maintain pre-Merger relationships with our customers or if more content providers begin to partner with distributors. To the extent the audience for our programs declines, advertisers' willingness to purchase our advertising could be reduced.Our failure to obtain or retain the rights in popular programming could adversely affect our operating results.The operating results from our radio programming business depends in part on our continued ability to secure and retain the rights to popular programming and then to sell such programming at a profit. We obtain a significant portion of our programming from third parties. For example, some of our most widely heard broadcasts, including certain NFL and NCAA games, are made available based upon programming rights of varying duration that we have negotiated with third parties. Competition for popular programming that is licensed from third parties is intense, and due to increased costs of such programming or potential capital constraints, we may be outbid by our competitors for the rights to new, popular programming or to renew popular programming currently licensed by us. Even when we are able to secure popular programming, the fee therefor (particularly sports programs and high-profile talent) is often significantly increased as a result of the competitive bidding process, which requires that we sell the advertising in this programming at a sufficiently higher volume and rate to offset the increased fees. While the Merger has diversified our business and provided us with a wider array of programming and services, our failure to obtain or retain rights to popular content could adversely affect our operating results. If we are not able to integrate future merger and acquisition ("M&A") activity successfully, our operating results could be harmed.We evaluate M&A opportunities, including acquisitions and dispositions, on an ongoing basis and intend to pursue opportunities in our industry and related industries that can assist us in achieving our growth strategy. The success of our future strategy will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate M&A opportunities and, if necessary, to obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing to fund such opportunities. M&A is inherently risky, and any M&A transactions we do complete may not be successful.Even if we are able to consummate the M&A transactions we pursue, such transactions may involve certain risks, including, but not limited to, the following: •diversion of our management's attention from normal daily operations of our business;•responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we sell, merge with and/or acquire;•insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with the M&A transactions we consummate or inability to realize the synergies we identify;•inability to maintain the key business relationships and reputations in connection with such M&A;•potential loss of key employees in connection with any M&A we undertake;•difficulty in integrating and managing the operations, technologies and products of the companies we merge with and/or acquire;•uncertainty of entry into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience or in which competitors have stronger market positions; and•dependence on unfamiliar affiliates and partners of the companies we merge with and/or acquire.Any future M&A transaction would require the consent of our lenders under the New Credit Facilities.Our success is dependent upon audience acceptance of our content which is difficult to predict.Revenue from our radio business is dependent on our continued ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behavior on a timely basis. Because consumer preferences are consistently evolving, the commercial success of a radio program is difficult to predict. It depends on the quality and acceptance of other competing programs, the availability of alternative forms 10Table of Contentsof entertainment, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which are difficult to predict. An audience's acceptance of programming is demonstrated by rating points which are a key factor in determining the advertising rates that we receive. Low ratings can lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising revenue. Consequently, low public acceptance of our content could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Risks Related to Our Common StockOur common stock may not maintain an active trading market which could affect the liquidity and market price of our common stock.Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market. However, there can be no assurance that an active trading market on the NASDAQ Global Market will be maintained, that our common stock price will increase or that our common stock will continue to trade on the exchange for any specific period of time. If we are unable to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Global Market, we may be subject to a loss of confidence by customers and investors and the market price of our shares may be affected.Sales of additional shares of common stock by Triton, Gores or our other significant equity holders (former holders of Westwood's Senior Notes) could adversely affect the stock price, particularly given the thin daily trading volume in our Class A common stock. Triton and Gores own approximately 59% and 31%, respectively, of our common stock on a combined basis (i.e., Class B common stock and Class A common stock, respectively). There can be no assurance that at some future time Triton, Gores, or our other former holders of our Senior Notes, will not, subject to the applicable requirements under the Securities Act, sell additional shares of our common stock, which could adversely affect our share price, particularly because so much of our Class A common stock is closely held which means we have a low public float and the daily trading volume is light. The perception that these sales might occur could also cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Such sales could also make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. Triton and Gores are able to exert significant influence over us and our significant corporate decisions and may act in a manner that advance their best interest and not necessarily those of other stockholders. As a result of their collective beneficial ownership of 90% of our common stock, Triton and Gores have voting control over our corporate actions. Gores owns 76% of the Class A common stock (which accounts for 41% of our common stock on a combined basis), which votes as a separate class on certain actions; and Triton owns 100% of the Class B common stock (which accounts for 59% of our common stock on a combined basis), which also votes as a separate class on certain actions. For so long as Triton and Gores continue to beneficially own shares of common stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, they will be able to elect the members of our Board of Directors and determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including matters involving mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or other equity securities and the payment of dividends on common stock (subject to the covenants and limitations set forth in our New Credit Facilities). Each of Triton and Gores may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders by, among other things:•delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control;•impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination;•discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control; or•causing us to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all of our stockholders.Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock. Provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that stockholders could receive a premium for their common stock in an acquisition. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. This provision of the Delaware 11Table of ContentsGeneral Corporation Law could delay or prevent a change of control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our available cash, if any, for use as working capital and for other general corporate purposes. Any payment of future cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, our New Credit Facilities restrict the payment of dividends. Any further issuance of shares of preferred stock by us could delay or prevent a change of control of our company, further dilute the voting power of the common stockholders and adversely affect the value of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 200,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. To the extent we choose to issue preferred stock, any such issuance may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares. In connection with the Merger, we issued 9,691.374 shares of Series A Preferred Stock leaving 190,308.626 shares of preferred stock available for future issuance.The further issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock.The issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock (as was the case with the Series A Preferred Stock) could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive. For example, investors in the common stock may not wish to purchase common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of common stock.Risks Related to the MergerThe anticipated operational benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully and may take longer to realize than expected.The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of Westwood One and Verge, which prior to the closing of the Merger, operated as two independent companies, and realize the anticipated benefits, including innovation, operational efficiencies and growth opportunities, from the combination. As an example, we may not be able to eliminate the duplicative costs we have planned to eliminate or we may incur expenses not presently contemplated by us as a result of the integration of the two businesses.The Merger involves the integration of two businesses, which is a complex and time-consuming process and could result in material challenges, including, without limitation: •the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls as a result of the devotion of management's attention to the Merger;•unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; •the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; •making any necessary modifications to internal financial control standards to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder;•retaining existing clients and attracting new clients; •consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; •coordinating geographically separate organizations and facilities; •managing a larger combined company; •maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;12Table of Contents•integrating two unique corporate cultures, which may prove to be incompatible;•unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; and •managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating operations.Some of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are able to successfully integrate the companies, there is a possibility that the Merger will not further our business strategy.Due to legal restrictions, prior to the closing of the Merger, we undertook only general and limited planning regarding the integration of the two companies. The actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized when anticipated. Delays encountered in the integration process could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition.Our financial results depend on our ability to maintain our relationships with advertisers, stations, customers and vendors, which relationships could potentially be affected by the Merger.A substantial portion of the revenue we receive is a result of relationships with clients, customers and vendors and our future success will depend in part of our ability to maintain these client relationships and resolve potential conflicts that may arise. Our clients and vendors may have termination or other rights that may be triggered by the Merger, or these clients or vendors may decide not to maintain their level of business or to renew their existing relationships with us. If we are unable to maintain these relationships, our business, financial results and financial condition could be adversely affected. The market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the Merger.The market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the Merger if, among other things, (1) we are unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings, (2) if the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the integration of the businesses are not realized or (3) if the transaction costs related to the Merger are greater than expected. The market price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by investors or analysts or if the effect of the Merger on our financial results is not consistent with their expectations.The Merger substantially reduced the percentage ownership interests of the pre-Merger Westwood stockholders; it may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.In connection with the Merger, we issued 34,237,638 shares of our Class B common stock to Verge's stockholders, which represent approximately 59% of our common stock after the Merger. We could encounter additional integration-related costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the Merger, or unforeseen liabilities or other issues resulting from the Merger. All of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Merger and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock.The foregoing risk factors that appear above may affect future performance. The accuracy of the forward-looking statements included in the risk factors above are illustrative, but are by no means all-inclusive or exhaustive. Accordingly, all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone. 13Table of Contents
