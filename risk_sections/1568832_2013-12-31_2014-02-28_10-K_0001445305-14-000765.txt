Item 1a. Risk FactorsYou should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to invest in shares of our Class A common stock. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price of your shares could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, including “Forward-Looking Statements.”12RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013Risks Related to the Pending AcquisitionsThe pending acquisitions are subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied, and may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all.Completion of each of the pending acquisitions is conditioned on certain closing conditions specific to each pending acquisition, which include, among other things, as set forth in the applicable acquisition agreement, FINRA having approved an application under FINRA (NASD) Rule 1017 for a change in the indirect ownership of the acquired businesses’ broker-dealer subsidiaries, in the case of ICH and Summit, the SEC having declared effective the registration statement on Form S-4 that we intend to file to register the shares of our Class A common stock to be issued in connection with the ICH merger and the Summit merger and the stockholders of ICH and Summit having approved the ICH merger and the Summit merger and other customary closing conditions. Also, any of the parties to any of the related agreements have termination rights if the transactions have not been completed by a specified date, during 2014. The First Allied acquisition is subject to a non-binding letter of intent.If the pending acquisitions are not completed on a timely basis, or at all, our business could be adversely affected, and we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:•we may be required to pay termination fees or reimburse expenses if certain of the merger agreements are terminated under specified circumstances, as described in the merger agreements;•time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the pending acquisitions (including integration planning) could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities;•the Bank commitment, could be subject to automatic reduction or the facilities contemplated by the Bank commitment, or the bank facilities, could be subject to mandatory prepayment; and•the market price of our Class A common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the pending acquisitions will be completed.Moreover, if any, or all, of the pending acquisitions is, or are, not completed on a timely basis, or at all, we also will not realize any of the benefits expected from its, or their, completion. This loss of benefits, or the increase in risks, could have a material adverse effect on our business.Cetera is the largest component of our independent retail advice platform, and we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our independent retail advice platform if we fail to complete the Cetera merger.Our independent retail advice platform will consist of Cetera, First Allied, ICH, J.P. Turner and Summit, but Cetera will be, by far, the largest component. Assuming all of the pending acquisitions are completed, Cetera is expected to represent a substantial portion of our revenues from our independent retail advice platform. Completing the Cetera merger is a key element of our growth strategy and an important element of our ability to realize benefits from our independent retail advice platform. There can be no assurance that we will complete the Cetera merger in a timely manner, or at all, and any failure to do so would have a material and adverse effect on our business and future prospects.Our ability to complete the Cetera merger and some or all of the other pending acquisitions is dependent on the consummation of the Cetera financings.While we have commitments for the Cetera financings, there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing or will be able to consummate them or arrange and obtain additional or alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to complete the Cetera merger and the other pending acquisitions. In addition, if we are able obtain alternative financings, we may incur increased interest and fees, and become subject to different terms and conditions generally.On February 13, 2014, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 for a public offering of our Class A common stock, but there can be no assurance that the offering will be consummated.If we are unable to obtain adequate funding for the cash consideration and other costs of the Cetera merger and the other pending acquisitions, we will be unable to consummate the Cetera merger and may be unable to consummate some or all of the other pending acquisitions, and we may be in default under one or more of the related agreements.In addition, failure to consummate the Cetera financings or obtain alternative financing could give rise to an obligation for us to pay Cetera a $75.0 million reverse termination fee.Our failure to consummate the Cetera financings for any reason would have a material and adverse effect on our business and future prospects.13RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013If the Cetera merger does not occur, we may incur payment obligations to Cetera.If the Cetera merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay Cetera a $75.0 million reverse termination fee, $55.0 million of which has been paid by us already into escrow. Payment of this termination fee could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Uncertainty regarding the completion of the pending acquisitions may adversely affect our business and the acquired businesses.The pending acquisitions will be completed only if certain conditions specific to each pending acquisition are met, which may cause uncertainty regarding the future structure and prospects of our company or the acquired businesses. This uncertainty may cause clients, prospects and financial advisors of our company or the acquired businesses to delay or defer the decision to do business with our company or the acquired businesses during the pendency of the pending acquisitions.Similarly, uncertainty regarding the completion of the pending acquisitions may foster uncertainty among financial advisors and employees of the acquired businesses about their future roles. This may adversely affect the ability of the acquired businesses to attract and retain key management, sales, marketing, trading and technical personnel.Restrictions on the operations of the acquired businesses may limit their ability to make acquisitions or dispositions, make capital expenditures, hire new employees and financial advisors and take other specified actions without our consent and also may impair the acquired businesses’ ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel and financial advisors and prevent the acquired businesses from executing their business plans, pursuing attractive business opportunities or addressing other strategic developments that may arise prior to the completion of the pending acquisitions.If uncertainty regarding the completion of the pending acquisitions, or any other risk or uncertainty, adversely affects the acquired businesses prior to the completion of the pending acquisitions, the acquired businesses may not be as valuable as we expected they would be following the completion of the pending acquisitions, and we may not realize the expected benefits of the pending acquisitions. Similarly, uncertainty regarding the completion of the pending acquisitions could also affect our ability to enter into future transactions including acquisitions, and otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.An adverse judgment in a lawsuit challenging any of the pending acquisitions may prevent it from becoming effective within the expected timeframe, or at all.Stockholders of the acquired businesses have filed lawsuits and may file additional lawsuits challenging the pending acquisitions, which name and may name us as a defendant.Summit, its board of directors, our company and a wholly owned subsidiary formed by our company in connection with the Summit merger are named as defendants in two purported class action lawsuits (now consolidated) filed by alleged Summit shareholders on November 27, 2013 and December 12, 2013 in Palm Beach County, Florida challenging the Summit merger. These lawsuits allege, among other things, that: (i) each member of Summit’s board of directors breached his fiduciary duties to Summit and its shareholders in authorizing the Summit merger; (ii) the Summit merger does not maximize value to Summit shareholders; and (iii) the defendants aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duty allegedly committed by the members of Summit’s board of directors. These shareholder lawsuits seek class action certification and equitable relief, including an injunction against consummation of the Summit merger on the agreed-upon terms.On January 13, 2014, a lawsuit was filed in state court in North Carolina by plaintiffs claiming to be minority and non-managing members of Hatteras against Hatteras and certain of its affiliates alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Hatteras acquisition. The plaintiffs claim certain of the defendants: (i) breached certain inter-company agreements by entering into the Hatteras purchase agreement, including through the sale of the Hatteras’ assets without plaintiffs’ consent; (ii) breached their fiduciary duties; and (iii) placed unreasonable restrictions on plaintiffs’ access to certain information. Among other remedies, the plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment that the Hatteras acquisition agreement is invalid and unenforceable. On January 28, 2014, Hatteras and the other defendants answered the complaint and filed counterclaims against the plaintiffs alleging that they: (i) breached the operating agreement; (ii) breached their fiduciary duties; (iii) committed a tort by using Hatteras’ confidential information to set up a competing fund; and (iv) interfered with the Hatteras purchase agreement by attempting to derail the sale. Hatteras and the other defendants also filed a motion for prompt hearing, requesting that the court promptly address the minority shareholders’ claim that Hatteras is prohibited from completing the sale.We cannot assure you as to the outcome of these lawsuits, or any similar lawsuit that may be filed in connection with any of the other pending acquisitions, including the costs associated with defending these claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation or settlement of these claims. If the plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction or other similar remedy prohibiting the parties from completing one of the pending acquisitions on the agreed-upon terms, it may not be completed in the expected time frame, or at all. Whether or not any plaintiff’s claims are successful, this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect the operation of our business.14RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013Integration of the acquired businesses into our business will be challenging and difficult, and we may be unable to profitably operate the acquired businesses and realize the expected benefits of the pending acquisitions.Our success will depend in large part on the success of our management in integrating the operations, strategies, technologies and personnel of the acquired businesses following the completion of the pending acquisitions. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the pending acquisitions if the integration process takes longer or is more costly than expected or otherwise fails to meet our expectations. In addition, we anticipate that the overall integration of the acquired businesses will be a time-consuming and expensive process that could significantly disrupt our business, even if it is effectively and efficiently planned and implemented, particularly given the size of Cetera relative to our size and the fact that we have made multiple acquisitions in a short period of time.Potential difficulties and challenges we may encounter in the integration process include the following:•the integration of management teams, strategies, technologies and operations, products and services;•the disruption of ongoing businesses and distraction of our management team and the management teams of the other acquired businesses from ongoing business concerns;•the creation of a need for additional compliance, documentation, risk management and internal control procedures, which could involve the hiring of additional personnel to implement and monitor such procedures;•the retention of clients, key employees and financial advisors of our business or the acquired businesses;•our ability to maintain the appropriate level of compliance and operational oversight over the acquired businesses, which will continue to operate independently under their existing brands and management, and financial advisors, who will continue to operate through small and decentralized branch offices;•the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;•the consolidation and rationalization of information technology platforms and administrative infrastructures;•the integration of corporate cultures and maintenance of employee morale; and•the integration of the acquired businesses’ accounting, human resources and other administrative systems, and coordination of trading, sales and marketing functions.Other factors may also prevent us from profitably operating the acquired businesses and realizing the expected benefits of the pending acquisitions:•during the year ended December 31, 2013, 90% of our revenues were derived from direct investment programs distributed by Realty Capital Securities, and there can be no assurance that this level of sales will be maintained or will increase following the completion of the pending acquisitions;•incurrence of substantial debt required to finance the pending acquisitions and the independent retail advice platform may place strains on our operations;•our failure to successfully further develop the acquired businesses;•inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of the acquired businesses;•harm to our existing business relationships, brand and reputation;•litigation for activities of the acquired businesses, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;•costs necessary to establish and maintain effective internal controls for the acquired businesses; and•increased fixed costs.Integration difficulties, or any other factors that make operating the acquired businesses or our business more challenging following the completion of the pending acquisitions, may prevent us from realizing the benefits from pending acquisitions to the extent, or in the time frame, anticipated by us. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or cash flows.To the extent we continue to expand our businesses following the completion of the pending acquisitions through new offerings and services or additional complementary acquisitions, we will face similar risks and uncertainties.15RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013The pending acquisitions may expose us to unknown liabilities.Following the completion of the pending acquisitions, we will be subject to all of the liabilities of the acquired businesses, other than certain liabilities not assumed pursuant to the agreements related to the pending acquisitions. If there are unknown liabilities or other obligations, including contingent liabilities, our business could be materially affected. We may learn additional information about the acquired businesses that adversely affects us, such as unknown liabilities or other issues that could affect our ability to comply with other applicable laws.Moreover, we do not have the right to be indemnified under all of the agreements related to the pending acquisitions, and, to the extent there is indemnification against such losses and liabilities in certain of the merger agreements, the amount of such indemnification is limited and may not be sufficient to cover the actual losses we may suffer.We have incurred, and expect to continue incurring, substantial expenses related to the pending acquisitions.We have incurred, and expect to continue incurring, substantial expenses in connection with completing the pending acquisitions and integrating the operations of the acquired businesses with our operations. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses would be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of our transaction and integration expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. As a result, the transaction and integration expenses associated with the pending acquisitions could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of the acquired businesses following the completion of the pending acquisitions.Risks Related to the Acquired BusinessesAny decrease in assets under administration or assets under management may decrease our revenue.Management fees are primarily based on assets under management. The results of operations of our independent retail advice platform will also depend on our level of assets under administration. Assets under management and assets under administration balances are impacted by both the flow of client assets in and out of accounts and changes in market values. Poor investment performance by financial products and financial advisors could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors. If the independent retail advice platform or the investment management platform experiences a reduction in assets under administration or assets under management, our revenues may decline.The independent retail advice platform will face significant competition for financial advisors.If the independent retail advice platform fails to attract new financial advisors or to retain and motivate existing financial advisors, its results of operations may suffer. The market for experienced and productive financial advisors is highly competitive, and significant resources must be devoted to attracting and retaining the most qualified financial advisors. If the independent retail advice platform is not successful in retaining highly qualified financial advisors, it may not be able to retain its clients or recover the expense involved in attracting and training these individuals. It also may be unable to recruit suitable replacements. A loss of a materially large group of financial advisors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Financial advisors face significant competition for their clients, who are critical to their success.Poor service or performance of the financial products that the independent retail advice platform offers may result in the loss of accounts for its financial advisors. In addition, the independent retail advice platform must monitor the pricing of its services and financial products in relation to competitors and periodically may need to adjust commission and fee schedules to remain competitive. Competitive pressures on the pricing of services or products can also cause clients to shift their accounts and investments to a different financial advisor or financial product. If the independent retail advice platform or the investment management platform experiences losses of managed accounts, or fails to attract new ones, our revenues would decline.Our success depends upon the continued services of key senior management personnel of the acquired businesses, including executive officers and senior managers.We expect the acquired businesses will continue to be operated independently under their existing brands and management following the completion of the pending acquisitions, and our success depends upon the continued services of key senior management personnel of the acquired businesses, including executive officers and senior managers. The loss of one or more of the key senior management personnel of the acquired businesses, and the failure to recruit a suitable replacement or replacements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.We have entered into agreements and offer letters with certain executive officers and senior managers pursuant to which they will remain employed by us following the completion of the pending acquisitions, which is consistent with our plan to have each of the acquired businesses continue to operate independently under our oversight following the completion of the pending acquisitions.16RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013The relationships of the independent retail advice platform with sponsors of financial products may be disrupted.The independent retail advice platform will have relationships with most of the industry-leading sponsors of financial and insurance products under selling agreements, which may include strategic partnership arrangements, that may be terminated upon notice. These relationships will be driven by many factors, such as the ability of the independent retail advice platform to facilitate sufficient sales volume through its distribution networks. It is possible that our ownership and control of the independent retail advice platform could create the perception that its financial advisors might favor products sponsored by American Realty Capital over products sponsored by other sponsors, which could affect the willingness of other sponsors to enter into new, or maintain existing, selling agreements with the acquired businesses. Any loss or damages to a relationship with a product sponsor, resulting in termination of a selling agreement or otherwise, could adversely affect our company.The independent retail advice platform will compete based on highly specialized and, in many cases, proprietary technologies that are difficult and costly to maintain.Highly specialized and, in many cases, proprietary technologies are required to support certain essential operational functions of the independent retail advice platform, including portfolio management, client service, accounting and internal financial processes and controls, and regulatory compliance and reporting. These technology platforms are also necessary to enable the independent retail advice platform to serve the needs of, and attract, financial advisors and enable it to serve the needs of its clients. Moreover, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and will enable the independent retail advice platform to reduce costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively adopt or develop new or adapt existing technologies to meet client, industry and regulatory demands made upon the independent retail advice platform, and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.Moreover, we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive technology and retain skilled information technology employees, although there can also be no assurance that we can retain such skilled information technology employees or that our investments in staff and technology will successfully meet the needs of financial advisors and their clients. Additionally, if the emergence of new industry standards and practices render our existing systems obsolete or uncompetitive, any upgrades or expansions may also require significant expenditures of funds and may also cause us to suffer system degradations, outages and failures. If our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could lead to a loss of financial advisors and their clients and could harm our business reputation. A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our financial advisors and their clients.There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage based on our technology.A change in the “independent contractor” status of financial advisors would adversely affect us.The independent retail advice platform relies on the treatment of financial advisors as independent contractors. Financial advisors operate from their own offices and are responsible in large part for the costs and expenses involved in their operations. The enactment of any legislation that would affect the eligibility requirements for independent contractor status could have a significant effect on this business model and lead to additional costs and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on the independent retail advice platform and our results of operations.We will be exposed to significant legal liabilities from the operations of our independent retail advice platform.We will be subject to claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business for our independent retail advice platform resulting from, among other things, alleged and actual errors and omissions, breach of fiduciary or other duties owed to clients, or misconduct in effecting securities transactions, rendering investment advice and placing insurance. These activities involve substantial amounts of money. Since claims may allege liability for all or part of the amounts in question, claimants may seek large damage awards. These claims can involve significant defense costs.Bases for such legal liability could include, but are not limited to:•recommending transactions that are not suitable for the client or in the client’s best interests;•engaging in fraudulent or otherwise improper activity;•binding us to transactions that exceed authorized limits;•hiding unauthorized or unsuccessful activities, resulting in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses;•improperly using or disclosing confidential information;•failure, whether negligent or intentional, to effect securities transactions on behalf of clients;•failure to perform reasonable diligence on a security, product or strategy;•failure to supervise a financial advisor;17RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013•failure to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information;•engaging in unauthorized or excessive trading to the detriment of clients; or•otherwise not complying with laws or control procedures.There can be no assurance that past or future activities of the acquired businesses exposing them to legal liability, on the bases described above or otherwise, will not lead to a material adverse effect on the business of our independent retail advice platform and our results of operations.Misconduct and errors by employees and financial advisors, who operate in a decentralized environment, could harm the independent retail advice platform.The businesses of our independent retail advice platform generally operate through small, decentralized offices, largely with financial advisors who are not our direct employees. We cannot always prevent misconduct and errors by financial advisors, and the precautions taken to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective in all cases. Additionally, SEC and FINRA rules require the broker-dealer entities on the independent retail advice platform to supervise the activities of their financial advisors. A substantial number of the offices are supervised by registered principals off-site.Misconduct by financial advisors on the independent retail advice platform, in connection with their direct interaction with clients or otherwise, and any failure to adequately supervise them, could subject us to liability and result in violations of law, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm to us.The independent retail advice platform will be dependent on third parties to provide clearing services.All of the acquired businesses rely on third parties to provide clearing services, as well as other operations and support functions that they cannot provide internally. In the event one or several of these relationships were to be terminated, there can be no assurance that the functions previously provided could be replaced on comparable terms, or at all. In the event a clearing broker was to cease doing business with any of the acquired businesses, their ability to execute transactions on behalf of, and provide a full range of services to, its clients could be negatively impacted, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on both its revenues and earnings.Furthermore, clearing agreements generally require introducing brokers, like the acquired businesses (other than Cetera Financial Institutions LLC), to indemnify the clearing broker against losses from securities transactions. Because the introducing broker is liable to the extent of the net loss on any unsettled trades, introducing brokers are customarily required to post a clearing deposit. However, there can be no assurance that the amount of any indemnified loss will not exceed the amount of any clearing deposit. Furthermore, in periods of extreme market volatility, it is possible that there may be an increase in the number of unsettled trades, which could cause the loss of clearing deposits as well as additional amounts.Our investment management platform will be dependent on the performance and popularity of the mutual funds it sponsors, which will be dependent on the performance of the investment funds it invests in and the investment policies and decisions of fund advisors chosen by those investment funds, which are outside our control.As an investment management platform, Hatteras is dependent on the performance of the mutual funds it sponsors, which can be adversely impacted by many factors, including adverse opinions by third parties, including rating agencies or industry analysts, and poor short-term performance, which may decrease sales and increase redemptions, irrespective of longer-term success.Moreover, because our investment management platform will primarily involve fund-of-funds investments, its performance will be affected by the investment policies and decisions of fund advisors which are outside its control. The Hatteras funds generally invest their assets in other investment funds, which in turn allocate assets to fund advisors. There can be no assurance that the allocation and investment decisions of the investment funds and their chosen fund advisors will be successful. Anything that adversely affects the investment funds could adversely affect our investment management platform and have a negative impact on our results of operations.There are risks involved in acting as a “fiduciary” under ERISA.The acquired businesses are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA or the Code with respect to benefit plan clients or otherwise deal with benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Code impose duties on persons who are considered fiduciaries, prohibit specified transactions involving benefit plan clients (including, without limitation, with respect to ERISA, employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) and, with respect to the Code, individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans) and impose monetary penalties (including excise taxes) for violations of these duties and restrictions. Any failure to comply with these requirements could result in significant liabilities, or, in a worst case, severely limit the extent to which the acquired businesses could act as fiduciaries for any plans.18RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013The SEC may limit 12b-1 fees.Certain of the acquired businesses receive 12b-1 fees, or trail commissions, related to the sale of mutual fund shares. The SEC has proposed certain measures that would establish a new framework to replace Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act with respect to how mutual funds collect and pay fees to cover the costs of selling and marketing their shares. Any adoption of such measures would likely be phased in over a number of years. As these measures are neither final nor undergoing implementation throughout the financial services industry, the impact of changes such as those currently proposed cannot be predicted at this time. In the event the SEC limited the ability of any of the acquired businesses to receive such fees, its revenues and earnings could be negatively impacted.Additionally, the U.S. Department of Labor (the "DOL"), which promulgates rules related to retirement plans, is considering eliminating commissions and 12b-1 fees on qualified retirement accounts, including IRAs.Risks Related to Our BusinessSubstantially all our revenues are derived from American Realty Capital, which is under common control with us.American Realty Capital, which is controlled, directly or indirectly, by our principals who, directly or indirectly control RCAP Holdings, has accounted for 80% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013. For example, all of the $28.1 billion in value of mergers and acquisitions transactions, all of the $22.7 billion in purchase price of equity capital markets transactions and all of the $10.3 billion of debt capital markets transactions on which our investment banking and capital markets business advised in 2013 related to transactions involving direct investment programs or entities which had been sponsored or managed by American Realty Capital. Moreover, $713.5 million of our $886.5 million in revenues in 2013 resulted from sales of equity capital of direct investment programs or other entities sponsored or managed by American Realty Capital. Sales of equity capital from programs sponsored or managed by American Realty Capital excludes one investment program co-sponsored by American Realty Capital and in which an affiliate of American Realty Capital is an advisor, but in which none of the executive officers are affiliates of American Realty Capital and in which the sub-advisor, which is unaffiliated with American Realty Capital is responsible for selection of investments on behalf of the advisor.As a result of our dependence upon American Realty Capital, any adverse impact on the results of operations of American Realty Capital would have an adverse impact on our results of operations.We may fail to manage our future growth effectively.We have significantly expanded our operations since they commenced with the inception of Realty Capital Securities in 2007, and we will continue to expand our operations through the completion of the pending acquisitions to include an independent retail advice platform and an investment management platform. The completion of the pending acquisitions will increase our revenues. It is also anticipated that we will continue our plan to expand and grow our business through additional complementary acquisitions and the exchange transactions.This future growth, if it occurs, will place significant demands on our management, infrastructure and other resources. To manage any future growth, we will need to:•hire, integrate and retain highly skilled and motivated employees, including the senior management of the acquired businesses who are retained following the completion of the pending acquisitions;•retain and maintain our relationships with clients, financial advisors and retail broker-dealers;•expand our financial and management controls, reporting and operational systems and procedures;•effectively integrate regulatory compliance functions of the independent retail advice platform and an investment management platform and any other complementary businesses acquired;•expand our marketing infrastructure and capabilities;•make capital expenditures on information technology, personnel, office space and tangible assets;•provide adequate training and supervision to maintain high quality standards; and•devote management’s attention to any unforeseen issues that may arise related to our growth.If we do not effectively manage our growth we may not be able to meet the needs of our clients and our financial advisors, which could adversely affect our revenues and operations.19RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013We have a limited operating history, and our past performance may not be indicative of our future results.Realty Capital Securities commenced operations August 2007. Our investment banking, capital markets and transaction management services platform was launched during the period from November 2012 through January 2013, and has a limited operating history. Following the completion of the pending acquisitions, a significant percentage of our revenue will be derived from our independent retail advice platform, a business we have not previously operated. Accordingly, you should not rely on our past performance to predict our future results.There can be no assurance that we will be successful in pursuing our long-term strategy of expanding into complementary businesses.Our long-term strategy includes expanding into complementary businesses. As part of this strategy we entered into the pending acquisitions. See “Item 1. Business - The Pending Acquisitions” for more details. There are also risks associated with acquisitions, including the pending acquisitions, which may be costly and may not result in their intended benefits. See “- Risks Related to the Pending Acquisitions” for a more detailed discussion of these risks.In addition, regulators may put restrictions on the ability of broker-dealers and investment advisers to add new financial advisors and/or branch offices which would be complementary to our business. Furthermore, any transaction similar to the pending acquisitions involving a change in ownership and control of a broker-dealer will require an application to FINRA for approval of such change of ownership, which approval may not be granted. Accordingly, even if we are able to negotiate a transaction with an acquisition candidate, we may not be able to consummate such transaction, thereby inhibiting our ability to fully execute our growth strategy.If we fail to acquire and integrate complementary businesses, our results of operations and future prospects would be adversely affected.There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our long-term strategy of expanding our service offerings to clients other than American Realty Capital.A key component of our long-term business strategy is to expand our wholesale distribution platform and our investment banking, capital markets and transaction management services platform to sponsors and other participants in the management and sale of direct investment programs, other than American Realty Capital. Other direct investment sponsors may not want to retain us for a variety of reasons, including our common ownership with American Realty Capital. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that such strategy will be successful.If we fail to increase or diversify our market share of direct investment programs, our results of operations and future prospects may be adversely affected.Extensive or frequent changes in regulations could adversely affect our business.The securities industry is subject to extensive and frequently changing requirements under federal and state securities and other applicable laws and self-regulatory organization rules. The SEC, FINRA, various securities exchanges and other U.S. governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislation and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations may be complex, and we may not have the benefit of regulatory or federal interpretations to guide us in compliance. Changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws also could have an adverse effect on our methods and costs of doing business.For example, with respect to direct investment programs, FINRA has proposed amendments to its rules that govern disclosure of a per share estimated value of a direct investment program security. Under one of the proposed amendments, the share value of a direct investment program security may be shown as the offering price per share less dealer manager fees, selling commissions, organization and offering expenses and potentially certain distributions, paid per share. The proposed amendments could adversely impact direct investment programs if investors or financial advisors react negatively to the new disclosure regime, and such an adverse impact on direct investment programs may harm our results of operations.In addition, state securities regulators require that investors in direct investment programs meet certain minimum income and/or net worth standards. These standards may vary from state to state and change frequently. Changes to suitability standards may require us to expend resources familiarizing ourselves, as well as the financial advisors with whom we do business, with the new standards. If a financial advisor does not satisfy the requirements with regards to suitability standards, we could be subject to substantial liability, including fines, penalties and possibly rescission.Along with suitability requirements, state regulators have also imposed limitations on an investor’s exposure to direct investment programs. The breadth and scope of these limitations have varied considerably and may operate to limit the exposure that a resident of a certain state has to a product, sponsor or direct investment programs generally. These concentration limitations have been applied with increasing frequency and have increasingly targeted all direct investment programs.20RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013The DOL is preparing an amendment to the definition of “fiduciary” for purposes of ERISA. The proposed rule would broaden the scope of persons who could be ERISA fiduciaries and the activities that could require fiduciary treatment. The proposed rule could have consequences on the securities industry that are difficult to predict. The uncertainty surrounding the proposed DOL rulemaking may cause broker-dealers to delay their decision to sell products that our clients are offering, which could reduce demand for our services. If we were deemed fiduciaries or if our activities were deemed to be fiduciary activities, or if the same were true for the broker‑dealers with whom we do business, or whom we may acquire through the pending acquisitions or otherwise, we and they may be subject to additional regulation and, potentially, liability, and our results of operations could suffer as a result.These risks, as well as the additional risks described under “- Risks Related to Our Industry - The acquired businesses are exposed to regulatory, compliance and legal risks that are different from those we currently face,” will also apply to our independent retail advice platform following the completion of the pending acquisitions.Realty Capital Securities is prohibited from raising money for U.S. Net Lease REITs sponsored by American Realty Capital.During 2013, 38% of Realty Capital Securities’ sales of interests in non-traded REITs consisted of sales of interests in U.S. Net Lease REITs sponsored by American Realty Capital. In connection with the merger between ARCP, and Cole, RCAP Holdings and Mr. Schorsch agreed that neither RCAP Holdings nor any of its affiliates, including Realty Capital Securities, will be permitted to sponsor or raise capital for any U.S. Net Lease REITs sponsored by American Realty Capital. Mr. Schorsch and other persons affiliated with RCAP Holdings are directors and executive officers of ARCP.Although this restriction does not prohibit Realty Capital Securities from raising money for U.S. Net Lease REITs that are not affiliates of RCAP Holdings, Mr. Schorsch or any of their affiliates, there can be no assurance that Realty Capital Securities will be able to sell interests in other types of REITs or U.S. Net Lease REITs sponsored by unaffiliated sponsors to replace the loss of sales in U.S. Net Lease REITs sponsored by American Realty Capital. Furthermore, although Cole’s wholesale broker-dealer has not to date distributed interests in REITs other than U.S. Net Lease REITs, it could in future do so and could compete with Realty Capital Securities.Our ability to attract and retain qualified professionals is critical to our success, and our failure to do so may materially impair the value of your shares of our Class A common stock.We depend on the skills and expertise of the qualified professionals who work for our operating subsidiaries and our success depends on our ability to retain existing and attract new qualified professionals. The professionals and senior marketing personnel of our operating subsidiaries have direct contact with our clients, financial advisors and retail broker-dealers, and with other key individuals, and the loss of these personnel could jeopardize those relationships and result in the loss of such accounts. If we lose the services of any key personnel, we may not be able to manage and grow our operations effectively, enter new markets, develop new products or effectively integrate businesses we acquire, including but not limited to the acquired businesses, into our operations.We also anticipate that it will be necessary for us to hire additional professionals as we further diversify our products and strategies. Competition for employees with the necessary qualifications is intense and we may not be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel. Our ability to retain and attract these personnel will depend heavily on the amount of compensation we can offer. Compensation levels in the securities industry are highly competitive. Consequently, our profitability could decline as we compete for personnel. An inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could affect our ability to provide acceptable levels of service to our clients and funds and hinder our ability to attract new clients, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.We may require additional financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.In order for us to have the opportunity for future success and profitability, we periodically may need to obtain additional financing, either through borrowings, public offerings, private offerings, or some type of business combination, including pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-1 we filed with the SEC on February 13, 2014 related to the potential sale and issuance of shares of our Class A common stock in a public offering. We may need to seek to raise additional capital through other available sources, which may include borrowing additional funds or raising additional capital from third parties in addition to the Cetera financings, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining required funds on favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, the issuance of new securities to raise capital will cause the dilution of shares held by current stockholders.If we are unable to generate adequate cash from our operations, or from financing activities, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely impacted.21RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013Our future indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and may limit our ability to use debt to fund future capital needs.Concurrently with the execution of the Cetera merger agreement, we entered into the Cetera commitments which comprise of (i) the Bank commitment, which provides for a commitment for an aggregate of $725.0 million in indebtedness under the bank facilities in connection with the completion of the Cetera merger; and (ii) the Luxor commitment, pursuant to which Luxor has committed to purchase shares of our Class A common stock under certain circumstances, which we refer to as the Luxor common stock, and certain other securities in connection with the completion of the Cetera merger, which we refer to as the Luxor securities. The Luxor securities include $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of newly issued 5% convertible notes due 7.5 years from the issue date (the "convertible notes") to Luxor in connection with the completion of the Cetera merger.Our level of indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. It could also require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. In addition, our level of indebtedness may limit our flexibility in planning for changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, and limit our ability to borrow additional funds.We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, we are limited in the amount of capital that we can draw from any broker-dealer subsidiary. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful or feasible and may not be on as favorable terms. The bank facilities and the indenture governing the convertible notes will restrict our ability to sell assets. Even if we could consummate those sales, the proceeds that we realize from them may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Furthermore, if an event of default were to occur with respect to our outstanding indebtedness, our creditors could, among other things, accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness.The bank facilities and the indenture governing the convertible notes will permit us to incur additional indebtedness. Although the bank facilities and the indenture governing the convertible notes will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions will be subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, these restrictions will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute “indebtedness” as defined in the bank facilities and the indenture governing the convertible notes. To the extent new debt or other obligations are added to our currently anticipated debt levels, the substantial indebtedness risks described above would increase.The bank facilities and the indenture governing the convertible notes will contain restrictions that may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business.The bank facilities and the indenture governing the convertible notes will contain customary restrictions on our activities, including covenants that may restrict us from:•incurring additional indebtedness or issuing disqualified stock or preferred stock;•paying dividends on, redeeming or repurchasing our capital stock;•making investments or acquisitions;•creating liens;•selling assets;•receiving dividends or other payments to us;•guaranteeing indebtedness;•engaging in transactions with affiliates; and•consolidating, merging or transferring all or substantially all of our assets.We will also be required to comply with financial covenants of a maximum total leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum regulatory net capital. These restrictions may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants will depend on our future performance, which may be affected by events beyond our control.22RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013If we violate any of these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, we would be in default under the bank facilities or indenture and payment of our indebtedness could be accelerated. The acceleration of our indebtedness under one agreement may permit acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay that indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our indebtedness is in default for any reason, our business could be materially and adversely affected.In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of our Class A common stock and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.Increases in interest rates, by potentially adversely impacting the performance of direct investment programs, including net lease programs, may negatively impact us.As with other yield-oriented securities, shares of direct investment programs, particularly those marketed to “mass affluent” investors, who we believe seek products with “durable income” characteristics, are impacted by their level of distributions to their stockholders. The distribution rate is often used by investors to compare and rank similar yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the level of distributions that direct investment programs may make and influence the decisions of investors who are considering investing in their common stock. A rising interest rate environment, due to recently announced changes in the monetary policy of the United States Federal Reserve or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on the common stock price of direct investment programs, their ability to issue additional equity and the cost to them of any such issuance. Because we rely on direct investment programs, any macroeconomic conditions affecting them adversely may negatively impact us.Rising interest rates may also have adverse effects on financial products sold through the independent retail advice platform, which could cause our results of operations to suffer.We are exposed to risks due to our investment banking activities.Participation in an underwriting syndicate or a selling group involves both economic and regulatory risks. An underwriter may incur losses if it is unable to resell the securities it is committed to purchase, or if it is forced to liquidate its commitment at less than the purchase price. In addition, under federal securities laws, other statutes and case law with respect to underwriters’ liabilities and limitations on the indemnification of underwriters by issuers, an underwriter is subject to substantial potential liability for misstatements or omissions of material facts in prospectuses and other communications with respect to such offerings. Acting as a managing underwriter increases these risks. Underwriting commitments constitute a charge against net capital and our ability to make underwriting commitments may be limited by the requirement that we must at all times be in compliance with the net capital rule.Our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified risks or an unanticipated level of risk.The policies and procedures we employ to identify, monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective. Some methods of risk management are based on the use of observed historical market behavior. As a result, these methods may not accurately predict future risk exposures, which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate. Other risk management methods depend on evaluation of information regarding markets, clients or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. This information may not be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to properly record and verify a large number of transactions and events. There can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively and accurately record and verify this information.Our ability to manage risk exposure can never be completely or accurately predicted or fully assured. For example, unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in one or more markets or other unforeseen developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The consequences of these developments can include losses due to adverse changes in inventory values, decreases in the liquidity of trading positions, higher volatility in earnings, increases in our credit risk to clients as well as to third parties and increases in general systemic risk.Realty Capital Securities is subject to risks that are particular to its role as dealer manager for direct investment program offerings.In connection with its role as dealer manager for direct investment program offerings, Realty Capital Securities provides substantial promotional support to the broker-dealers selling a particular offering, including by providing sales literature, forums, webinars, press releases and other forms of mass communication. Due to the volume of materials that Realty Capital Securities may provide throughout the course of an offering, much of which may be scrutinized by regulators, Realty Capital Securities may be exposed to significant liability under federal and state securities laws, and subject to fines by the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators, or even suspension from the securities industry.23RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013Failure to comply with the net capital requirements could subject us to sanctions imposed by the SEC or FINRA.Realty Capital Securities is, and any other broker-dealer acquired by us will be, required to maintain certain levels of minimum net capital subject to the SEC’s net capital rule. The net capital rule is designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of a broker-dealer. Compliance with the net capital rule limits those operations of broker-dealers that require the intensive use of their capital, such as underwriting commitments and principal trading activities. The rule also limits the ability of securities firms to pay dividends or make payments on certain indebtedness, such as subordinated debt, as it matures. FINRA may enter the offices of a broker-dealer at any time, without notice, and calculate the firm’s net capital. If the calculation reveals a deficiency in net capital, FINRA may immediately restrict or suspend certain or all the activities of a broker-dealer. Realty Capital Securities, and any other broker-dealer acquired by us, may not be able to maintain adequate net capital, or its net capital may fall below requirements established by the SEC, and may subject us to disciplinary action in the form of fines, censure, suspension, expulsion or the termination of business altogether. In addition, if these net capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital, operations that require the intensive use of capital would be limited. A large operating loss or charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our present levels of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may become subject to net capital requirements in other foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or which we may enter. We cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing.Our business could be adversely affected by a downturn in the financial markets.Our business is materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Many factors or events could lead to a breakdown in the financial markets, including war, terrorism, natural catastrophes and other types of disasters. These types of events could cause people to begin to lose confidence in the financial markets and their ability to function effectively. If the financial markets are unable to effectively prepare for these types of events and ease public concern over their ability to function, our revenues are likely to decline and our operations are likely to be adversely affected.Unfavorable financial or economic conditions may reduce the number and size of the transactions in which we provide underwriting services, merger and acquisition consulting and other services. Our investment banking revenues, in the form of financial advisory, placement agent and underwriting fees, are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which we participate and would therefore be adversely affected by a sustained market downturn. Additionally, a downturn in market conditions could lead to a decline in the volume of transactions that we execute for our clients and, therefore, to a decline in the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads.Market fluctuations and volatility may reduce our revenues and profitability.Our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected by declines in the volume of securities transactions and in market liquidity. Additionally, our profitability may be adversely affected by losses from the underwriting of securities or the failure of third parties to meet commitments.Lower securities price levels may also result in a reduced volume of transactions. During periods of declining volume and revenue, our profitability would be adversely affected. Declines in market values of common stocks and the failure of issuers and third parties to perform their obligations can result in illiquid markets.We face competition from other financial firms.We compete directly with national and regional full-service broker-dealers and a broad range of other financial services firms, including banks, investment advisers and insurance companies. Competition has increased as smaller securities firms have either ceased doing business or have been acquired by or merged into other firms. Mergers and acquisitions have increased competition from these firms, many of which have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Many of these firms offer their clients more products and research than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies and client requirements. These competitors may have lower costs or provide more services, and they may offer their clients more favorable commissions, fees or other terms than those offered by us. The acquired businesses are subject to similar competition.If we do not continue to develop and enhance our services in a timely manner, our business may be harmed.Our future success will depend on our ability to develop and enhance our services and add new services. We operate in a very competitive industry in which the ability to develop and deliver advanced services through the Internet and other channels is a key competitive factor. There are significant risks in the development of new or enhanced services, including the risks that we will be unable to effectively use new technologies, adapt our services to emerging industry or regulatory standards or market new or enhanced services.24RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013If we are unable to develop and introduce new or enhanced services quickly enough to respond to market or client requirements or to comply with emerging industry standards, including regulatory standards, or if these services do not achieve market acceptance, our business could be seriously harmed.We face significant competition for wholesalers.We are dependent upon our employees who recruit and manage retail broker-dealers for the offerings of direct investment programs for which Realty Capital Securities serves as dealer manager, whom we refer to as our wholesalers. We are exposed to the risk that our wholesalers could leave or decide to affiliate with one of our competitors and that we would be unable to recruit suitable replacements. A loss of a large group of wholesalers could have a material adverse impact on Realty Capital Securities business.Providing transaction management services involves providing services that meet the legal needs of our clients and, as a result, is subject to a variety of complex and evolving laws and regulations.Providing transaction management services involves providing services that meet the legal needs of our clients, which may subject us to allegations of unauthorized practice of law ("UPL"). UPL generally refers to an entity or person giving legal advice who is not licensed to practice law. However, laws and regulations defining UPL, and the governing bodies that enforce UPL rules, differ among the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We are unable to acquire a license to practice law in the United States, or employ licensed attorneys to provide legal advice to our clients, because we do not meet the regulatory requirement of being exclusively owned by licensed attorneys. We also may be subject to laws and regulations that govern business transactions between attorneys and non-attorneys, including those related to the ethics of attorney fee-splitting and the corporate practice of law. We may incur costs associated with responding to, defending and settling proceedings related to UPL, and the provision of our services more generally. We can give no assurance that we will prevail in such regulatory inquiries, claims, suits and prosecutions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Responding to, defending and/or settling regulatory inquiries, claims, suits and prosecutions may be time-consuming and divert management and financial resources or have other adverse effects on our business. A negative outcome in any of these proceedings may result in changes to or discontinuance of some of our services, potential liabilities or additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.Internet and internal computer system failures or security breaches could damage our reputation and harm our business.A portion of our business is conducted through the Internet and through our internal computer system, either of which could experience system failures and degradations in the future due to circumstances beyond our control, which include, but are not limited to:•human error;•subsystem, component or software failure;•a power or telecommunications failure;•an earthquake, fire, or other natural disaster or act of God;•hacker attacks or other intentional acts of vandalism; or•acts of terror or war.Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Failure to adequately protect the integrity of our computer systems and safeguard the transmission of confidential information could harm our business.The secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations. We rely on encryption and authentication technology to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet. We cannot assure you that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments will not result in a compromise of the technology or other algorithms used by our vendors and us to protect client transaction and other data. Any compromise of our systems or security could harm our business.25RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013Our brands may not achieve broad recognition.We believe that broader recognition and positive perception of our brands and the brands of our operating subsidiaries, and the brands of any businesses we or they may acquire are essential to our future success. Our successful positioning of our brands will depend in a large part on the success of our advertising and promotional efforts, an increase in the number of users and page views of our websites, and the ability to continue to provide a website and services useful to our clients. Accordingly, we intend to continue to pursue an aggressive brand enhancement strategy, which includes multimedia advertising, promotional programs and public relations activities. These initiatives require significant expenditures. If our brand enhancement strategy is unsuccessful, these expenses may never be recovered and we may be unable to increase future revenues.The preservation and enhancement of the brands of the acquired businesses is essential to their success. We expect that the acquired business will continue to be operated independently under their existing brands and management following the completion of the pending acquisitions, subject to our oversight. Any failure of the brand enhancement strategy or other marketing efforts of any of the acquired businesses could have an adverse impact on us.A failure to protect our reputation could adversely affect our businesses.Our ability to attract and retain clients, investors, employees and financial advisors is highly dependent upon external perceptions of us and our operating subsidiaries. Damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects and may arise from numerous sources, including litigation or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, compliance failures, any perceived or actual weakness in our financial strength or liquidity, unethical behavior and the misconduct of our employees, financial advisors and counterparties. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing and potential clients, investors, employees and financial advisors. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us.The preservation of the reputations for independence of the independent broker-dealer subsidiaries that will make up our independent retail advice platform will also be important to our success. We expect the independent broker-dealer subsidiaries will continue to be operated independently under their existing brands and management following the completion of the pending acquisitions, subject to our oversight. Currently, the independent broker-dealer subsidiaries which will comprise our independent retail advice platform offer interests in direct investment programs and other products sponsored by American Realty Capital, and we expect they will continue to do so following the completion of the pending acquisitions. There is a risk that continuing, or increasing, this level of sales following the completion of the pending acquisitions could affect the independent broker-dealer subsidiaries’ reputation for independence, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Risks Related to Our IndustryWe are subject to various risks associated with the securities industry.We are subject to uncertainties that are common in the securities industry. These uncertainties include:•the volatility of domestic and international financial, bond and stock markets;•extensive governmental regulation;•litigation;•intense competition;•substantial fluctuations in the volume and price level of securities; and•dependence on the solvency of various third parties.As a result, revenues and earnings may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. In periods of low volume, profitability is impaired, because certain expenses remain relatively fixed. In the event of a market downturn, our business could be adversely affected in many ways. Our revenues are likely to decline in such circumstances and, if we are unable to reduce expenses at the same pace, our profit margins would erode.Broker-dealers and other financial services firms are subject to extensive regulations and increased scrutiny.The financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal, state and international government agencies, as well as various self-regulatory agencies. Recent turmoil in the financial markets has contributed to significant rule changes, heightened scrutiny of the conduct of financial services firms and increasing penalties for rule violations. We may be adversely affected by new laws or rules or changes in the interpretation of existing rules or more rigorous enforcement. Significant new rules are developing under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). Some of these rules could impact our businesses, including through the potential implementation of a more stringent fiduciary standard for brokers and enhanced regulatory oversight over incentive compensation.26RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013We also may be adversely affected by other evolving regulatory standards, such as those relating to suitability and supervision. Legal claims or regulatory actions against us also could have adverse financial effects on us or harm our reputation, which could harm our business prospects.Realty Capital Securities is, and any acquired broker-dealer will be, registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and a member of FINRA, and subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the SEC, FINRA, other self-regulatory organizations and state securities regulators. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales practices, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, record-keeping and the conduct and qualification of officers, employees and independent contractors. As part of the regulatory process, broker-dealers and investment advisers are subject to periodic examinations by the SEC, the purpose of which is to determine their compliance with securities laws and regulations. Broker-dealers are also subject to routine and for-cause examinations by FINRA. It is not uncommon for the regulators to assert, upon completion of an examination, that the broker-dealer being examined has violated certain of these rules and regulations. Depending on the nature and extent of the violations, the broker-dealer may be required to pay a fine and/or be subject to other forms of disciplinary action. Additionally, the adverse publicity arising from the imposition of sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients.The SEC and self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA, have the authority to bring administrative proceedings against firms under their jurisdiction, whether arising out of examinations or otherwise, for violations of the securities laws. Administrative sanctions can include cease-and-desist orders, censure, fine, civil monetary penalties and disgorgement and may even result in the suspension or expulsion of the firm from the securities industry. In June 2013, Realty Capital Securities entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent ("AWC"), with FINRA that included findings that certain violations of SEC and FINRA rules, including Rule 10b-9 under the Exchange Act and FINRA Rule 2010, had occurred in connection with its activities as a co-dealer manager for a public offering, as further described under Note 7 -Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Similar sanctions may be imposed upon officers, directors, representatives and employees. Judicial proceedings also may be initiated by the SEC or state regulators where the misconduct warrants such action and may result in injunctive relief, civil monetary penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions. Financial services firms are subject to numerous conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest. The SEC and other federal and state regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest. We have adopted, and regularly review and update, various policies, controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts. However, appropriately addressing conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to appropriately address conflicts of interest. Our policies and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts may also result in increased costs and additional operational personnel. Failure to adhere to these policies and procedures may result in regulatory sanctions or litigation against us.Financial services firms are also subject to rules and regulations relating to the prevention and detection of money laundering. The PATRIOT Act mandates that financial institutions, including broker-dealers and investment advisors, establish and implement anti-money laundering ("AML"), programs reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 and the rules thereunder. Financial services firms must maintain AML policies, procedures and controls, designate an AML compliance officer to oversee the firm’s AML program, implement appropriate employee training and provide for annual independent testing of the program. We have established AML programs but there can be no assurance of the effectiveness of these programs. Failure to comply with AML requirements could subject us to disciplinary sanctions and other penalties.Financial services firms must also comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including SEC Regulation S-P and applicable provisions of the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 and the 2003 Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. Any violations of laws and regulations relating to the safeguarding of private information could subject us to fines and penalties, as well as to civil action by affected parties.The acquired businesses are exposed to regulatory, compliance and legal risks that are different from those we currently face.In the same manner as Realty Capital Securities, the registered broker-dealer or investment adviser subsidiaries of Cetera and the other acquired businesses must comply with applicable regulations or risk serious adverse consequences to their businesses. In addition, the acquired businesses engage in regulated activities that are different from those currently undertaken by our operating subsidiaries and thus will expose us to different risks. The independent retail advice platform deals with retail clients through networks of financial advisors that operate through multiple separate branch offices. We will be responsible for the conduct of a retail business, including the management and supervision of branch office operations and the supervision of retail activities. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries, employees and agents will have significant obligations to clients. As we expand our independent retail advice platform, we will likely increase our exposure to claims and litigation resulting from, among other things, alleged and actual errors and omissions, breach of fiduciary or other duties owed to clients, or misconduct in effecting securities transactions, rendering investment advice and placing insurance. 27RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013The registered broker-dealer or investment adviser subsidiaries of Cetera and the other acquired businesses will also be engaged in the sale of certain products that are different from those currently sold by Realty Capital Securities, such as insurance products, including annuities and life insurance. Significant risk management and supervisory systems and controls and surveillance protocols are required to oversee these businesses. To the extent that our systems and controls are ineffective in assuring compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, we could be exposed to significant regulatory sanctions. It is not uncommon for registered broker-dealers or investment advisers to be subject to assertions of violations of the rules and regulations of FINRA and the SEC. Certain of the acquired businesses and their financial advisors have been subject to investigations and administrative complaints by FINRA and the SEC, some of which are ongoing and some of which have resulted in fines, settlements and orders to pay restitution. While each of the acquired businesses maintains insurance designed to lessen the cost of defending and/or settling such matters and paying for any fines imposed, these insurance policies have limitations and deductibles and do not fully insulate the acquired businesses from such costs. There can be no assurance that the findings of any regulatory agencies will not result in subjecting us (and possibly certain of our principals and/or financial advisors) to some form of disciplinary action, including fines.The independent retail advice platform includes subsidiaries that are SEC-registered investment advisers, which are subject to different compliance and oversight regimes than SEC-registered broker-dealers.The SEC oversees all activities of registered investment advisers under the Advisers Act. Subsidiaries of the acquired businesses that are registered as investment advisers with the SEC will be subject to the requirements of the Advisers Act, including examination by the SEC’s staff. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, performance fees, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation arrangements, conflicts of interest, advertising, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between the adviser and advisory clients, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements and general anti‑fraud provisions.The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Failure to comply with the Advisers Act or other federal and state securities and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, profit disgorgement, fines or other similar consequences.We rely on direct investment programs for a substantial portion of our revenues.During the period from 2008 to 2013, a substantial portion of our revenues came from services provided to direct investment programs, and it is anticipated that a substantial portion of our revenues will come from direct investment programs in the future as well. Our exposure to direct investment programs leaves us vulnerable to adverse developments including, but not limited to:•a reduction in the popularity of direct investment programs among retail investors;•rising interest rates, which could have the effect of reducing investor demand for higher‑yielding securities;•a determination by the Federal Reserve that asset bubbles in certain investment product categories may require a policy response;•continued or increasing negative publicity concerning non-traded REITs;•changes in tax law;•increased, costly or burdensome regulation from the SEC, state securities regulators or FINRA; and•malfeasance by sponsors or broker-dealers of direct investment programs, including by our competitors.More particularly, recent scrutiny from FINRA, the SEC and state securities regulators has caused, and could continue to cause, negative publicity about direct investment programs.In 2011, FINRA filed a complaint against a broker-dealer charging it, among other things, with soliciting investors to purchase non-traded REIT shares without fully investigating suitability, and for marketing non-traded REITs on its website with misleading returns. On October 22, 2012, the case was settled and FINRA ordered the broker-dealer to pay approximately $12.0 million in restitution to affected clients, and to clients who were charged excessive markups. The founder of the broker-dealer was personally fined $250,000 and suspended for one year from the securities industry and two years from acting as a principal.On November 22, 2011, FINRA entered into a settlement with a second broker-dealer for using misleading, unwarranted or exaggerated marketing materials in the sale of a non-traded REIT. The broker-dealer was ordered to pay a fine of $300,000, and has neither admitted nor denied the charges.28RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013On December 12, 2012, the Massachusetts Securities Division (the ''Division"), filed an administrative complaint against a third broker-dealer, accusing it of violating Massachusetts securities laws in the sale of non‑traded REIT shares. On February 6, 2013, the Division and the broker-dealer entered into a consent order that required, among other things, a $2.0 million payment by the broker-dealer to Massachusetts investors, payment of a $500,000 fine and an agreement by the broker-dealer to reform its selling practices. On May 22, 2013, the Division announced settlements with five broker-dealers requiring them to make $6.0 million in restitution to investors and pay fines totaling $975,000 over the improper sale of shares of non-traded REITs.The proceedings outlined above, none of which involved us or our affiliates, have received substantial publicity, much of it negative. In addition, both the SEC and FINRA issued bulletins in 2011 and 2012, respectively, urging investors to conduct careful reviews before investing in non-traded REITs, which has also generated negative publicity.An adverse development relating to direct investment programs, including but not limited to negative publicity or any of the foregoing, could reduce our sources of revenue and negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock.Our ability to raise capital in a timely manner in the amount that we may require is limited by the operation of FINRA’s (NASD) Rule 1017.FINRA’s (NASD) Rule 1017 requires that any member of FINRA file an application for approval of any change in ownership that would result in one person or entity directly or indirectly owning or controlling 25% or more of member firm’s equity capital. The application must be filed at least 30 days prior to effecting a change. The approval process under FINRA (NASD) Rule 1017 can take six months or more to complete.The required FINRA process under FINRA (NASD) Rule 1017, including the required 30-day notice period before effecting a change in ownership, could hinder or delay us in any effort to raise capital, where, as a result of the capital raised, any person or entity would own or control 25% of more of any of our broker-dealer subsidiaries.While we may effect a change in ownership 30 days after submitting notice to FINRA, FINRA may place interim restrictions on the firm pending final approval, and there is no guarantee that FINRA would ultimately approve any such change in ownership or control.Difficult market conditions for investment products can adversely affect our business.Demand for investment products, such as direct investment programs and mutual funds, is materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world. The future market and economic climate may deteriorate because of many factors beyond our control, including rising interest rates, the rate of inflation, currency exchange rates, changes in the regulatory environment, wars, acts of terrorism or political uncertainty. Difficult market and economic conditions, the level and volatility of interest rates, investor sentiment and political events have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our business and profitability in many ways. For example, our revenues are directly related to the volume and value of investment banking and brokerage transactions in which we are involved. During periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions, the volume and size of these transactions may decrease, thereby reducing the demand for our services and increasing price competition among financial services companies seeking available engagements. Our results of operations would also be adversely affected by any reduction in the volume or size of corporate finance transactions. Similarly, weakness in equity markets and diminished trading volume of securities could adversely impact retail brokerages, which are the clients of Realty Capital Securities. Our profitability may also be adversely affected by the possibility that we would be unable to scale back other costs quickly enough to match any decreases in revenue relating to changes in market and economic conditions.29RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013Significantly expanded corporate governance and public disclosure requirements may result in fewer public offerings and discourage companies from engaging in capital markets transactions, which may reduce the number of investment banking opportunities available for us to pursue.Highly publicized financial scandals in recent years have led to investor concerns over the integrity of the U.S. financial markets, and have prompted the U.S. Congress, the SEC and NYSE to significantly expand corporate governance and public disclosure requirements. To the extent that private companies, in order to avoid becoming subject to these new requirements, decide to forego public offerings or elect to be listed on foreign markets, our underwriting business may be adversely affected. In addition, provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley, the Dodd-Frank Act, and the corporate governance rules imposed by self-regulatory organizations and stock exchanges have diverted the attention of many companies away from capital markets transactions, including securities offerings and acquisition and disposition transactions. In particular, companies that either are or are planning to become public companies are incurring significant expenses in complying with the SEC reporting requirements relating to internal controls over financial reporting, and companies that disclose material weaknesses in such controls may have greater difficulty accessing the capital markets. The Dodd-Frank Act contains several provisions that will have a direct impact on the operations of our investment banking and capital markets business. The legislation contains changes to the laws governing, among other things, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments, mortgage originations, holding company capital requirements and risk retention requirements for securitized loans. The full impact of the Dodd‑Frank Act on our business and operations will not be known for years until all of the regulations implementing the statute are written and adopted. However, the Dodd-Frank Act may have a material impact on our operations, particularly through an increased regulatory burden and increased compliance costs. These factors, in addition to adopted or proposed accounting and disclosure changes, may have an adverse effect on our business.Our exposure to legal liability is significant, and damages and other costs that we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and regulatory inquiries, and the reputational harm that could result from legal action against us, could adversely affect our businesses.We face significant legal risks in connection with our businesses and, in recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have been increasing. These risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions, employment claims, potential liability for advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions and disputes over the terms and conditions of complex trading arrangements.Moreover, our role as advisor to clients on important underwriting or mergers and acquisitions transactions involves complex analysis and the exercise of professional judgment. These activities may subject us to the risk of significant legal liabilities to our clients and aggrieved third parties, including our clients’ stockholders who could bring securities class action suits against us. There can be no assurance that indemnities from our clients and provisions to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services will protect us or be enforceable in all cases. As a result, we may incur significant legal and other expenses in defending against litigation and may be required to pay substantial damages for settlements and adverse judgments. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against our investment banking business could harm our results of operations or harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.Employee misconduct, which is difficult to detect and deter, could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subjecting us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.Recently, there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry, and there is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, we often deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients. If our employees were to improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position, current client relationships and ability to attract future clients. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. If our employees engage in misconduct, our business could be adversely affected.If we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have an adverse effect on our business.We are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, and we intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and would harm our business and the price of our Class A common stock.30RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013Risks Related to our StructureThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control over us in RCAP Holdings and, indirectly, in those who control RCAP Holdings.Holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share, and pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, so long as any of our Class B common stock remains outstanding, the holders of our Class B common stock always will have a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. After giving effect to the exchange transactions that occurred on February 11, 2014, RCAP Holdings holds our sole outstanding share of Class B common stock and thereby controls us. RCAP Holdings’ retention of this single share of our Class B common stock following the exchange transactions will also allow it to retain the majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock and, thereby, retain effective control of our board of directors and the ability to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. In addition, even if the share of Class B common stock were not outstanding, RCAP Holdings owns 90.76% of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock, as of February 28, 2014 and would still control us through its ownership of such shares. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters and RCAP Holdings has the ability to control all matters affecting us, including:•the composition of our board of directors and, through our board of directors, any determination with respect to our business plans and policies;•any determinations with respect to mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations;•our acquisition or disposition of assets;•our financing activities;•certain changes to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation;•amendments to any agreements between us and RCAP Holdings;•corporate opportunities that may be suitable for us and RCAP Holdings;•determinations with respect to enforcement of rights we may have against third parties;•the payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock; and•the number of shares available for issuance under our stock plans for its prospective and existing employees.If RCAP Holdings does not provide any requisite consent allowing us to conduct such activities when requested, we will not be able to conduct such activities and, as a result, our business and our operating results may be harmed. The individuals who control RCAP Holdings, Messrs. Schorsch and Kahane, also control RCS Capital Management, which means that these individuals may have an even greater influence over our affairs than their control over RCAP Holdings alone would dictate.RCAP Holdings’ ability to control our board of directors may also make it difficult for us to recruit high-quality independent directors. Persons who would otherwise have accepted an invitation to join our board of directors may decline to do so, which makes the recruitment of the most qualified independent directors more difficult.In the event RCAP Holdings is acquired or otherwise undergoes a change of control, any acquirer or successor will be entitled to exercise the voting control and contractual rights of RCAP Holdings, and may do so in a manner that could vary significantly from that of RCAP Holdings.It may be difficult to favorably resolve any disputes that arise between us and RCAP Holdings.Disputes may arise between RCAP Holdings and us in a number of areas relating to our ongoing relationships, including:•employee retention and recruiting;•business combinations involving us;•our ability to engage in activities with certain potential clients;•sales or dispositions by RCAP Holdings of all or any portion of its ownership interest in us; and•business development or marketing activities by us which may require the consent of RCAP Holdings.We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if the conflict were between two unaffiliated parties. The agreements we have entered into with RCAP Holdings may only be amended upon agreement between the parties. While we are controlled by RCAP Holdings, we may not have the leverage to negotiate amendments to these agreements, if required, on terms as favorable to us as those we would negotiate with an unaffiliated third party.31RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013We have elected to take advantage of the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies, which could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.Because we qualify as a “controlled company” under the corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies, we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. In light of our status as a controlled company, our board of directors has determined not to have an independent nominating function or to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board of directors, and we have elected not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent and not to have a compensation committee. Accordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all the corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.We are dependent on RCS Capital Management and its officers, who provide services to us through the services agreement.We rely heavily on RCS Capital Management to conduct day-to-day business operations of our company, and to provide strategic planning and consulting services to us and our operating subsidiaries. Accordingly, the success of our businesses depends to a significant extent upon the efforts, experience, diligence, judgment, skill and network of business contacts of the officers of RCS Capital Management. The departure of any of the officers of RCS Capital Management could have a material adverse effect on our performance and slow our future growth.RCS Capital Management is not obligated to dedicate any of its officers exclusively to us. In addition, none of our officers or the officers of RCS Capital Management is obligated to dedicate any specific portion of his time to our business. Each of these individuals has significant responsibilities for other business segments currently managed by affiliates of American Realty Capital, including as a result of being part of the senior management or key personnel of other American Realty Capital-sponsored entities and their advisors. For example, five of the American Realty Capital-sponsored REITs have registration statements that became effective within the last 12 months. Additionally, one American Realty Capital-sponsored program is currently in registration. As a result, these individuals may not always be able to devote sufficient time to the management of our business. Further, when there are turbulent conditions in the real estate markets or distress in the credit markets that affect American Realty Capital, the attention of RCS Capital Management’s principals and executive officers will also be required by the other entities and businesses managed by affiliates of American Realty Capital. In such situations, we may not receive the level of support and assistance that we might receive if we were internally managed.In addition, no assurance can be given that RCS Capital Management will continue to provide services to us. The initial term of the services agreement between RCAP and RCS Capital Management extends until June 10, 2033, with automatic five-year renewals, subject to termination by nonrenewal upon a 180-day prior written notice. If the services agreement is terminated and no suitable replacement is found to provide the services needed by us under that agreement, we may not be able to execute our business plan.The services agreement was not negotiated on an arm’s-length basis and may not be as favorable as a services agreement negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.Four of our five executive officers and five of our nine directors are also principals of RCAP Holdings and all of our executive officers and four of our nine directors are executive officers of RCS Capital Management, all of whom are also executive officers of American Realty Capital. Our services agreement with RCS Capital Management was negotiated between related parties and its terms, including amounts payable thereunder, may not be as favorable as if it had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.Termination of the services agreement by us without cause would be difficult to effect. During the initial term, we, together with RCS Holdings, may terminate the services agreement only for cause. Effective at the expiry of the initial 20-year term or any subsequent five-year renewal term, we, together with RCS Holdings, may terminate the services agreement without cause, upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors based upon: (1) RCS Capital Management’s unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to us; or (2) a determination that the quarterly fees, incentive fees or performance-based awards payable to RCS Capital Management are not fair, subject to RCS Capital Management’s right to prevent termination based on unfair fees or awards by accepting a reduction of quarterly fees, incentive fees or awards agreed to by at least two-thirds of our independent directors. RCS Capital Management will be provided 180 days’ prior written notice of any such termination. These provisions may adversely affect our ability to terminate RCS Capital Management without cause.RCS Capital Management is not contractually committed to serve us beyond June 10, 2033. Thereafter, the services agreement will be renewable for five-year terms; provided, however, that RCS Capital Management may terminate the services agreement before the end of any five-year term at will upon 180 days’ prior written notice. If the services agreement is terminated and no suitable replacement is found, we may not be able to execute our business plan.32RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013Pursuant to the services agreement, RCS Capital Management does not assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder and is not responsible for any action of our board of directors in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations. RCS Capital Management maintains a contractual as opposed to a fiduciary relationship with us. Under the terms of the services agreement, none of RCS Capital Management or any of its respective officers, members or personnel, any person controlling or controlled by RCS Capital Management or any person providing sub-advisory services to RCS Capital Management will be liable to us, any subsidiary of ours, our directors, our stockholders or any of our subsidiaries’ stockholders or partners for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the services agreement, except because of acts constituting bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify RCS Capital Management and each of its officers, stockholders, members, managers, directors and personnel, any person controlling or controlled by RCS Capital Management and any person providing sub-advisory services to RCS Capital Management with respect to all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims arising from acts or omissions of RCS Capital Management not constituting bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence. Payment of fees to RCS Capital Management reduces cash available for business investment and stockholder distribution.RCS Capital Management provides certain services to us pursuant to a services agreement. RCS Capital Management is paid substantial fees for these services, which reduces the amount of cash available for investment in our business or distribution to our stockholders. Such fees consist of (i) a quarterly fee; (ii) an incentive fee; and (iii) performance-based awards to RCS Capital Management. Also, in the future we may contract with RCAP Holdings and/or RCS Capital Management to perform other services for us for which we will pay additional fees.In general, we and our subsidiaries are permitted to deduct all ordinary and necessary business expenses incurred in the operation of our businesses. The quarterly fee payable by us and RCS Holdings to RCS Capital Management, a related party, is allocated among us and RCS Holdings based on any reasonable method determined by our independent directors, such as the relative value of the services provided during the relevant period or the relative amount of time spent by RCS Capital Management providing management services to us, on the one hand, and RCS Holdings and to operating subsidiaries, on the other hand. The Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), could challenge the allocation of the quarterly fee among us and RCS Holdings or the deductibility of the quarterly fee by us or RCS Holdings if, for example, the amount of the quarterly fee is not reasonable relative to the services provided. If the deduction were successfully denied, in whole or in part, we or RCS Holdings, as applicable, would compute taxable income without deducting the quarterly fee, thereby increasing taxable income (or reducing losses) despite the reduction in our or RCS Holdings’ cash due to the payment of the quarterly fee to RCS Capital Management.There are various conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with RCAP Holdings and RCS Capital Management, which could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders.We are subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with RCAP Holdings and RCS Capital Management. Specifically, Mr. Schorsch, the executive chairman of our board of directors, Mr. Kahane, our chief executive officer and one of our directors, Mr. Budko, our executive vice president, chief investment officer and one of our directors, Mr. Block, one of our directors, and Mr. Weil, our president, treasurer, secretary and one of our directors, are executives and/or members of both RCAP Holdings and RCS Capital Management. These individuals have conflicts between their duties to us and their duties to, and interests in, RCAP Holdings, RCS Capital Management and other affiliates of RCAP Holdings and RCS Capital Management, and these conflicts may not be resolved in our favor.Conflicts may arise with respect to the interpretation, continuation, renewal or enforcement of our agreements with RCS Capital Management, RCAP Holdings and their affiliates, including the agreements described under “Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” The resolution of any such conflict in favor or RCAP Holdings, RCS Capital Management or any of their affiliates may materially harm our results of operations and the value of your shares of our Class A common stock.33RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013The quarterly fees payable to RCS Capital Management under the services agreement may cause RCS Capital Management to engage in risky behavior in order to increase its compensation.Under the services agreement, RCS Capital Management is entitled to receive (i) quarterly fees based on our GAAP pre-tax income; and (ii) incentive fees based on our Core Earnings (as defined below). RCS Capital Management is also entitled to receive performance-based awards based on Total Return as measured against a peer group of companies, as further described under “Management - 2013 Manager Multi-Year Outperformance Agreement.” In providing services to us under the terms of the services agreement, the opportunity to earn compensation based on our GAAP pre-tax income and based on Core Earnings may lead RCS Capital Management to place undue emphasis on the maximization of our aggregate GAAP pre-tax income and Core Earnings at the expense of other criteria that would be beneficial to our business, such as preservation of capital, in order to obtain more compensation. Additionally, RCS Capital Management might engage in risky or speculative behavior in order to maximize Total Return, even if such behavior might put us at risk. Core Earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as our after-tax GAAP net income (loss), before the incentive fee plus non-cash equity compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income (loss). The amount may be adjusted to include one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash charges after discussions between RCS Capital Management and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of our independent directors.We are an “emerging growth company” under the federal securities laws and subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the "JOBS Act") and are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from, or reduced disclosure obligations relating to, various reporting requirements that are normally applicable to public companies. We could remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of: (1) the last day of the first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more; (2) December 31 of the fiscal year that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million, measured as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months); or (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.We expect that we will cease to be an “emerging growth company” on December 31, 2014, assuming the completion of the pending acquisitions.Under the JOBS Act, “emerging growth companies” are not required to (1) provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, pursuant to Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley; (2) comply with new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB"), which may require mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor must provide additional information about the audit and the issuer’s financial statements; (3) comply with new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012 (unless the SEC determines otherwise); (4) provide certain disclosures relating to executive compensation generally required for larger public companies; or (5) hold stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation. Other than as set forth in the following paragraph, we have not yet made a decision as to whether to take advantage of any or all the JOBS Act exemptions that are applicable to us. If we avail ourselves of any of the remaining exemptions from various reporting requirements, it may be more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us and we do not know if some investors will find shares of our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, which may result in a less active trading market for shares of our Class A common stock or a more volatile stock price.Additionally, the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies. This means that an “emerging growth company” can delay adopting certain accounting standards until such standards are otherwise applicable to private companies. However, we have elected to “opt out” of such extended transition period, and will therefore comply with new or revised accounting standards on the applicable dates on which the adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of such extended transition period for compliance with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.We would be required to pay to RCAP Holdings most of the tax benefit of any depreciation or amortization deductions we may claim as a result of any step up in tax basis we would receive if the exchange by RCAP Holdings of substantially all of its Operating Subsidiaries Units is characterized as a taxable exchange.If the exchange by RCAP Holdings of substantially all of its Operating Subsidiaries Units for shares of our Class A common stock (and cancellation of its corresponding shares of our Class B common stock) through the exchange transactions qualifies as a tax-free contribution to us under Section 351 of the Code, we would obtain carryover tax basis in the tangible and/or intangible assets of our operating subsidiaries connected with such Operating Subsidiaries Units. Accordingly, we would not be required to make any payments under the tax receivable agreement we have entered into with RCAP Holdings.34RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013However, if this exchange were treated as a taxable exchange, each of our operating subsidiaries intends to have an election under Section 754 of the Code which would result in us receiving a step up in the tax basis in the tangible and intangible assets of our operating subsidiaries connected with such Operating Subsidiaries Units. The increase in tax basis would be expected to reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be liable for in the future. Pursuant to the tax receivable agreement we have entered into with RCAP Holdings, we would be required to pay RCAP Holdings 85% of the amount of the reduction, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax liabilities that we realize as a result of this increase in tax basis resulting from the exchange. The amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement would vary depending on a number of factors, including the extent to which the exchange is taxable, the amount and timing of our income and the tax rates then applicable. See “Relationships and Related Party Transactions - Tax Receivable Agreement.”Risks Related to our Class A Common Stock The market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.The market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume on Class A common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our Class A common stock declines significantly, you may be unable to resell your shares of our Class A common stock at or above your purchase price, if at all. There can be no assurance that the market price of our Class A common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our Class A common stock, or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of Class A common stock, include:•adverse publicity about direct investment programs, generally, or individual scandals specifically;•general market and economic conditions;•variations in our quarterly operating results;•our failure to meet the market’s earnings expectations;•departures of principals or additions/departures of other key personnel;•adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;•actions by our stockholders;•changes in market valuations of similar companies;•actual or anticipated poor performance in our underlying investment strategies;•publication of research reports about us or the securities industry, or the failure of securities analysts to cover our Class A common stock;•changes or proposed changes in laws or regulation, or differing interpretations thereof, affecting our business, or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters; and•litigation and governmental investigations.Public perceptions of the actual or expected risks or benefits of the pending acquisitions could also affect the price of our Class A common stock. If we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the pending acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts, or the effect of the pending acquisitions on our financial results is otherwise not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts, the market price of our Class A common stock may decline as a result of the pending acquisitions. Similarly, uncertainty about the completion of the pending acquisitions, which are subject to conditions, may also affect the market price of our Class A common stock.Future sales of our Class A common stock in the public market or future issuances in connection with acquisitions of businesses could lower our stock price.The market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock by RCAP Holdings or the perception that such sales could occur. We have also filed with the SEC on February 13, 2014, a Registration Statement on Form S-1 related to the potential sale and issuance of shares of our Class A common stock in a public offering. Sales and issuances of our Class A common stock may also occur in connection with the concurrent private offering contemplated in the Registration Statement on Form S-1, the issuance of the Luxor securities, the issuance of additional shares of our Class A common stock or to pay consideration at the completion of the Summit merger, the First Allied acquisition, the ICH merger and the J.P. Turner acquisition. These sales or issuances, or the possibility that these sales or issuances may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future, at a time and price that we deem appropriate.35RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013Pursuant to the registration rights agreement entered into with RCAP Holdings and RCS Capital Management, we have agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to file registration statements from time to time for the sale of the shares of our Class A common stock, including our Class A common stock upon exchange of Operating Subsidiaries Units upon completion of the exchange transactions, and any equity-based awards granted to RCS Capital Management under our equity plan. Pursuant to the Luxor commitment, we have agreed to file with the SEC a continuously effective resale registration statement for the shares of our Class A common stock and other securities issued to Luxor in the concurrent private offering and in connection with the Cetera financings within 45 days of their issuance. There can be no assurance as to the size or price of future issuances of our Class A common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A common stock may have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.You will suffer dilution in connection with future issuances of our Class A common stock.Any public and private offerings of our Class A common stock, the issuance of the Luxor securities and the issuance of additional shares of our Class A common stock to pay consideration at the completion of the Cetera merger, the First Allied acquisition, the ICH merger and the J.P. Turner acquisition as well as any additional capital that we raise through sale of equity or convertible securities or any equity or convertible securities issued as consideration in future acquisitions, could also dilute your ownership in us. Furthermore, if we issue equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our Class A common stock, such as the convertible preferred stock to be issued to Luxor in connection with the Cetera financings. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering may depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our Class A common stock and diluting their interest in us.We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue paying dividends at the current rate.We currently pay cash dividends to our Class A stockholders on a quarterly basis as approved by our board of directors. However, our stockholders may not receive the same dividends following the completion of the Cetera merger and the other pending acquisitions, for various reasons, including the following:•as a result of the issuance of shares of our Class A common stock in connection with the ICH merger, the J.P. Turner acquisition and the Summit merger, if those transactions are completed, and the potential issuance of the Luxor securities in connection with the Cetera financings, and in connection with any public and private offerings of our Class A common stock, the total amount of cash required for us to pay dividends at our current rate will increase;•we may not have enough cash to pay such dividends due to changes in our cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flow or financial position;•we have agreed with Luxor that prior to the date the Luxor securities are issued in connection with the completion of the Cetera merger, we will not directly or indirectly cause our operating subsidiaries to pay any dividend to any member except to the extent that such dividends do not exceed $5.0 million in the aggregate per fiscal quarter, which limits our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders prior to the date the Luxor securities are issued in connection with the completion of the Cetera merger;•our ability, and the ability of our operating subsidiaries, to pay dividends is expected to be limited by customary negative covenants that will be contained in agreements we will enter into if we consummate the Cetera financings; and•we may desire to retain cash to maintain or improve our credit rating.Our stockholders also may not receive the same dividends for other reasons, including the following:•our stockholders have no contractual or other legal right to dividends that have not been declared and decisions on whether, when and in which amounts to make any future distributions will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of our board of directors, which reserves the right to change our dividend practices at any time and for any reason; and•the amount of dividends that our operating subsidiaries may distribute to us may be subject to restrictions imposed by state law, or regulators and restrictions imposed by the terms of any current or future indebtedness that these subsidiaries may incur.As a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our Class A common stock.36RCS Capital Corporation and SubsidiariesDecember 31, 2013Anti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws could discourage a change of control that our stockholders may favor, which could negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock.Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt. In addition, the holders of our Class B common stock always will have a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. The market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected to the extent that the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws will discourage potential takeover attempts that our stockholders may favor. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.The trading market for our Class A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us. If few or no securities or industry analysts cover us, the market price of our Class A common stock could be negatively impacted. If securities or industry analysts cover us and if one or more of such analysts downgrades our Class A common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our Class A common stock may decline. If one or more of the analysts covering us fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A common stock could decline, which could cause the price and trading volume of our Class A common stock to decline.All of our debt obligations, and any future indebtedness we may incur, will have priority over our Class A common stock with respect to payment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up.In any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, our Class A common stock would rank below all debt claims against us. In addition, any convertible or exchangeable securities or other equity securities that we may issue in the future, such as the Luxor securities, may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our Class A common stock. As a result, holders of our Class A common stock will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets upon the liquidation or dissolution until after our obligations to our debt holders and holders of equity securities that rank senior to our Class A common stock have been satisfied.Item 1B.
