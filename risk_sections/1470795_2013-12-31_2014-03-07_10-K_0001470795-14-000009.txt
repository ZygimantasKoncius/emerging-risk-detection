ITEM 1A. Risk FactorsOur loan portfolio has greater risk than those of many savings banks due to the substantial number of automobile and other consumer loans in our portfolio.We have a diversified loan portfolio with a substantial number of loans secured by collateral other than owner-occupied one- to four-family residential real estate. Our loan portfolio includes a substantial number of indirect automobile loans which are automobile loans referred to us by participating automobile dealerships. At December 31, 2013, our consumer loans totaled $311.6 million, or 37.7% of our total loan portfolio, and indirect automobile loans were the largest category of consumer loans, representing 32.0% of total loans at December 31, 2013. At that date, we had consumer loans 60 days or more past due of $1.3 million, or 37.5% of total loans 60 days or more past due. Indirect automobile loans represented $1.2 million, or 35.0% of total loans 60 days or more past due at December 31, 2013. Our consumer loan portfolio also includes direct automobile loans, unsecured loans, and loans secured by other personal property. Consumer loans generally have greater risk of loss or default than one- to four-family residential real estate loans, particularly in the case of loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles, or loans that are unsecured. In these cases, we face the risk that any collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. Thus, the recovery and sale of such property could be insufficient to compensate us for the principal outstanding on these loans. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit our ability to recover on such loans. Finally, because indirect automobile loan applications are completed by automobile dealerships, we assume the risks associated with a dealership properly complying with federal, state, and local consumer protection laws.As a result of our relatively large portfolio of consumer loans, it may become necessary to increase our provision for loan losses in the event our losses on these loans increase, which would reduce our profits. In addition, a portion of our automobile loans are made to borrowers with credit scores that would cause such loans to be considered subprime. At December 31, 2013, $32.5 million, or 11.0% of our total automobile loan portfolio, consisted of automobile loans where the borrower’s credit score was 660 or less (a possible indication of a credit-impaired borrower). See “Item 1. Business — Lending Activities — Consumer Lending.”A portion of our loan portfolio consists of loans made to persons with impaired credit or with reduced documentation, which presents greater risk of loss or delinquency.As of December 31, 2013, $48.1 million, or 19.7% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans, were to borrowers with no credit score or a credit score of 660 or less (a possible indication of a credit-impaired borrower) and an additional credit weakness. Weakened credit characteristics of a borrower may include prior loan payment delinquencies, foreclosure of prior loans, bankruptcies, or prior non-payment of loans. Loans to such borrowers may also present a greater credit risk to us based upon the borrower’s debt to income ratio, the results of a credit review, or other criteria that indicate that the borrower may have an insufficient or impaired credit history.We also have loans to borrowers who provide limited or no documentation of assets or income, known as stated income loans. At December 31, 2013, we had $7.7 million of one- to four-family residential real estate stated income loans, or 3.2% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans. As of December 31, 2013, we had $3.3 million of interest-only one- to four-family residential real estate loans. This amount represents 1.4% of our total one- to four-family residential real estate loans, with $2.7 million of our interest-only loans comprised of adjustable-rate loans. The interest rate on these loans is initially fixed 38Table of Contentsfor three, five, or seven year terms and then adjusts in accordance with the terms of the loan to require payment of both principal and interest in order to amortize the loan for the remainder of the term.In 2008, we began purchasing one- to four-family residential real estate loans, which included subprime, stated income, and interest-only loans, at a discount to the original principal balance of the mortgage loan. As of December 31, 2013, the total outstanding balance of all purchased one- to four-family residential real estate loans was $13.6 million, or 5.2% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans and 1.7% of our total loans, while the carrying value of such loans, net of purchase discounts, was $11.9 million. Our purchased one- to four-family residential real estate loans included $3.1 million of subprime loans as of December 31, 2013. In addition, these purchased one- to four-family residential real estate loans included $7.3 million of stated income loans and $2.7 million of interest-only loans (of which $1.7 million were also stated income loans). At December 31, 2013, the purchased subprime, stated income, and interest-only loans represented 1.2%, 2.8%, and 1.0%, respectively, of our total one- to four-family residential real estate loans. We may purchase subprime, stated income, and interest-only loans, as market conditions permit, provided we are able to obtain the loans at a sufficient discount to the loan balance to compensate us for the added risk associated with such loans.These types of one- to four-family residential real estate loans are generally considered to have a greater risk of delinquency and foreclosure than conforming loans and may require greater provisions for loan losses. Although we have not experienced large increases in delinquencies or foreclosures in this portfolio in relation to our other residential real estate loans, our residential real estate loan portfolio may be adversely affected in the event of a continued downturn in regional or national economic conditions. In addition, the value of the real estate securing these loans may become less than any remaining loan balance if local property values deteriorate further. Consequently, we could sustain loan losses and be required to establish a higher provision for loan losses.Our exposure to credit and regulatory risk is increased by our commercial real estate, real estate construction, and commercial business lending.Commercial real estate, real estate construction, and commercial business lending have historically had higher credit risk than single-family residential lending. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or related borrowers. At December 31, 2013, our portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaled $106.6 million, or 12.9% of our total loans, our portfolio of real estate construction loans totaled $59.6 million, or 7.2% of our total loans, and our portfolio of commercial business loans totaled $69.3 million, or 8.4% of our total loans. At December 31, 2013, commercial real estate loans that were delinquent 60 days or more totaled $120,000. We had no real estate construction loans or commercial business loans that were delinquent 60 days or more at December 31, 2013. We intend to continue to emphasize the origination of these types of loans consistent with safety and soundness standards.Commercial real estate loans, real estate construction loans, and commercial business loans generally have a greater risk of loss than owner-occupied one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Repayment of commercial real estate, real estate construction, and commercial business loans generally depends, in large part, on sufficient income from the property or the borrower’s business to cover operating expenses and debt service. These types of loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Changes in economic conditions that are beyond the control of the borrower and lender may affect the value of the security for the loan, the future cash flow of the affected property or business, or the marketability of a construction project with respect to loans originated for the acquisition and development of property.We emphasize business lending and marketing our products and services to small and medium-sized businesses. These small and medium-sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively affect these businesses, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.Protecting our business from identity theft and the theft of other customer data increases our cost of operations. To the extent that we, or our third-party providers, are unable to prevent the loss of customer information, our operations may become disrupted and our net income may be adversely affected.We must protect our computer systems and network from physical break-ins, security breaches, and other disruptive problems caused by the Internet or other users. Moreover, third-party providers, such as payment processing centers, must also take similar actions to protect customer information. We rely on encryption and authentication technology to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmissions of confidential information, as do our third-party providers. However, security measures implemented by us or our third-party providers may not prevent cyber-fraud. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to protect customer transaction data. If any compromise 39Table of Contentsof our security or the security of our third-party providers were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.If our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease.We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio, requiring us to make additions to our allowance for loan losses. While our allowance for loan losses was 0.78% of total loans at December 31, 2013, material additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income.In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Future changes in interest rates could reduce our profits.Our ability to make a profit depends largely on our net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between: •the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and•the interest expense we incur on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.As a result of our focus on one- to four-family residential real estate loans, the interest rates on our loans are generally fixed for a longer period of time than the interest rates on our deposits. Additionally, many of our investment securities have lengthy maturities with fixed interest rates. Like many savings institutions, our focus on deposit accounts as a source of funds, which have either no stated maturity or shorter contractual maturities than mortgage loans, results in our liabilities having a shorter average duration than our assets. For example, as of December 31, 2013, 20.9% of our loans had maturities of 15 years or longer, while 52.8% of our certificates of deposit had maturities of one year or less. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because market interest rates change over time. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest we earn on our assets, such as loans and investments, may not increase as rapidly as the interest we pay on our liabilities, such as deposits. In a period of declining interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may decrease more rapidly than the interest expense we incur on our liabilities, as borrowers prepay mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities and callable investment securities are called or prepaid, thereby requiring us to reinvest these cash flows at lower interest rates.In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average lives of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. A reduction in interest rates generally results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities, as borrowers refinance their debt in order to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Conversely, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans.Changes in interest rates also affect the current fair value of our interest-earning securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2013, the fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, consisting of mortgage-backed securities and CMOs issued by U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, agency bonds, municipal obligations, and equity securities totaled $430.8 million with $4.4 million in total gross unrealized gains and $7.2 million in total gross unrealized losses on these securities at December 31, 2013.We evaluate interest rate sensitivity using an internal calculation that estimates the change in our net portfolio value over a range of interest rate scenarios, also known as a “rate shock” analysis. Net portfolio value is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. As of December 31, 2013, our “rate shock” analysis indicated that our net portfolio value would increase by $53,000 if there was an instantaneous 200 basis point increase in market interest rates and would decrease by $11.4 million if there was an instantaneous 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates. See “Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk — Management of Market Risk.”40Table of ContentsA return of recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and/or reduced demand for our products and services, which would lead to lower revenue, higher loan losses and lower earnings.A return of recessionary conditions and/or continued negative developments in the U.S. economic and credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate values and sales volumes and increased unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in our levels of non-performing and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and financial condition. Strong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability.Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market areas, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a long-term basis. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans in order to remain competitive, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected.Financial reform legislation enacted by Congress will result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations.Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. This law significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading, and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years.The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments. The legislation also directs the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not.The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive, or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance by their applicable bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws.It remains difficult to predict what specific impact the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks. Moreover, significant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are not yet effective, and the legislation requires various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations over the next several years. Although, the substance and scope of these regulations cannot be determined at this time, it is expected that at a minimum they will increase our operating and compliance costs and could increase our interest expense.We operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Such regulators govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors, consumers, and investors. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operations of a bank, the classification of assets by a bank, and the adequacy of a bank’s allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on our results of operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules, and applicable regulations are subject to regular modification and change. There can be no assurance that proposed laws, rules, and regulations, or any other 41Table of Contentslaws, rules, or regulations, will not be adopted in the future, which could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or prospects.ITEM 1B.
