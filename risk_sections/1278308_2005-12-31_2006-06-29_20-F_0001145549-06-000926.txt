D. RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to our Business We are substantially dependent on two online games, which accounted for approximately 63.4% of our net revenues in 2005 and which may have a finite commercial lifespan. We are dependent upon The Legend of Mir II, or Mir II, and The World of Legend, or Woool, for the majority of our revenue. In 2005, Mir II and Woool accounted for approximately 35.3% and 28.1% of our net revenues, respectively. These and other online games may, however, have finite commercial lifespans. We believe that Mir II, which we commercially launched in the fourth quarter of 2001, has already entered the mature stages of its lifecycle. Woool, which we commercially 8 Table of Contents launched in the fourth quarter of 2003, may also be entering the mature stages of its lifecycle. We believe that the revenue generated by Mir II and Woool will generally continue to decline but may fluctuate in absolute amounts as the games continue to age and as we and our competitors release new games on the market. Nonetheless, we expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from Mir II and Woool through at least 2006. Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected by any occurrence that leads to a more rapid decline in revenue generated by Mir II and Woool, including but not limited to:  any reduction in purchases of in-game items or value-added services by Mir II or Woool users or any decrease in the popularity of either game in the China market due to intensifying competition or other factors;  loss of our rights to operate either of these games due to a termination of necessary licenses or other reasons;  failure to make improvements, updates or enhancements to Mir II or Woool in a timely manner; or  any lasting or prolonged server interruption due to network failures or other factors or any other adverse developments specific to Mir II or Woool. If we are unable to consistently license or develop additional successful online games, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In order to maintain our long-term profitability and operational success, we must continually license or develop new online games that are attractive to our users to replace our existing online games as they reach the end of their commercial lifespan, which we believe is typically four to five years for successful online games, and two to three years for most other online games. Our ability to license successful online games will depend on our ability to identify games that will appeal to our users, the availability of such games at acceptable costs, our ability to compete effectively to attract the licensors of such games, and our ability to obtain government approvals required for the licensing and operation of such games. It is, however, difficult at the testing phase to determine which online games will appeal to our users. In addition, many of the games that are licensed by overseas developers were not designed specifically for Chinas online game market, further complicating the task of identifying or implementing games that will appeal to our users. Moreover, due to increased competition among online game operators in China, upfront license fees for licensed games have increased and some licensors are demanding guaranteed minimum royalty payments. We may be unable to fully recover upfront and minimum royalty licensing costs if a licensed game is not popular among users. In 2006, for example, we expect to commercially launch Dungeons and Dragons Online, an MMORPG based upon a well-known American role playing board game. Dungeons and Dragons Online is not, however, as well-known in China as in the United States and the online version of the game, which was designed primarily for the North American market, may not be popular among Chinese online game players. Our ability to internally develop successful online games will depend on our ability to anticipate changing consumer tastes and preferences, to adopt new technologies, to attract, retain and motivate talented online game developers and to effectively execute online game development plans. Internal online game development requires substantial initial investment prior to commercial launch of the games as well as a significant commitment of future resources to produce 9 Table of Contents upgrades and expansion packs. As with the licensing costs for third-party games, we may be unable to fully recover development costs if the games are not popular among users. We cannot be certain that the games we license from third parties or internally develop will be attractive to users, will be viewed by the regulatory authorities as complying with content restrictions, will be launched as scheduled or will be able to compete with games operated by our competitors. If we are not able to consistently license or develop online games with continuing appeal to users, our future profitability and growth prospects will decline. If we are unable to maintain stable relationships with the overseas licensors of our online games, we may experience difficulties in the continued operation of our existing licensed games, the extension of existing licenses and the granting of licenses for new games. We need to maintain stable working relationships with our overseas licensors in order to ensure the continued smooth operation of our licensed online games and our continued access to new online game licenses. In 2005, we derived approximately 55.1% of our net revenues from online games that were licensed from third parties. We are dependent upon our licensors for the provision of technical support necessary for the operation of the licensed games as well as expansion packs and upgrades that help to sustain interest in a game among online users. In addition, certain marketing activities often require the consent of our licensors. Moreover, certain of our licenses may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events, such as our material breach of the license. If a licensed game is successful during its initial term of operation, we may be required to negotiate with our licensors to extend that term of operation. Our ability to maintain stable working relationships with our overseas licensors also influences our ability to license new online games developed by the same or other licensors. If we are unable to maintain stable relationships with our overseas licensors, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We or our licensors may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may force us to incur substantial legal expenses and, if determined adversely against us or our licensors, may materially disrupt our business. In particular, we are currently subject to copyright infringement and unfair competition claims by Wemade and Actoz with respect to Woool, which if determined adversely against us, could cause us to stop operating Woool. We cannot be certain that internally developed or licensed online games and other interactive entertainment content do not and will not infringe upon patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. Of the twelve games that we commercially operated as of December 31, 2005, six are internally developed and six are licensed form third parties. In connection with our EZ initiative, we also cooperate with numerous service and content providers that supply interactive entertainment content, such as movies, music, news and information. We or any of our licensors may become subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others. If we or our licensors are found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others, we may be required to pay damages and be enjoined from using such intellectual property, and we may incur new or additional licensing fees if we wish to continue using the infringing content, or be forced to develop or license alternatives. In addition, we may incur substantial expenses in defending against these third party infringement claims, regardless of their merit. 10 Table of Contents On October 8, 2003, Wemade Entertainment Co., Ltd. (Wemade) filed claims against us in the Beijing First Intermediate Peoples Court, or the Beijing Court, with respect to our operation of Woool. Wemade has alleged, among other things, that Woool copied Mir II and elements of the Legend of Mir III, or Mir III, which is another online game that Wemade developed, thereby infringing Wemades copyrights in these games. In addition, Wemade has alleged that our operation of Woool violates the PRC Anti-Unfair Competition Law. In particular, Wemade has alleged that the Chinese name for Woool, which includes two characters from the Chinese name for Mir II, misleads users and that we previously encouraged users to switch from Mir II to Woool by permitting the transfer of game characters developed in Mir II to Woool. Wemade has requested the Beijing Court to, among other things, order us to stop our operation of Woool, and to pay its legal fees and related costs incurred in connection with this litigation. On May 24, 2004, the Beijing Court informed us that Actoz Soft Co., Ltd. (Actoz) had been joined as a co-plaintiff in these proceedings. On October 14, 2005, the Beijing Court completed a series of hearings in connection with this matter and the parties are now awaiting a decision from the Beijing Court. If the Beijing court determines that we have violated the Mir II or Mir III copyrights, we may be required to pay damages as well as the plaintiffs legal fees and related costs, each of which may be material. In addition, we may be required to modify portions of Woool or to completely cease operation of Woool, which accounted for approximately 28.1% of our net revenues in 2005. Furthermore, if the Beijing Court determines that we have violated the PRC Anti-Unfair Competition Law, we may be required to modify the Chinese name for Woool. Any lapse in our right to operate Woool in China, or any modifications to the game itself, as a result of this litigation, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Negative publicity in China regarding online games could lead to additional government regulations that may have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The media in China has reported incidents of violent crimes allegedly inspired by online games, including theft of online game virtual items among users. In addition, incidences of excessive online game playing and allegations that online games distract students and interfere with their education have also been reported in the media. This negative publicity regarding the online game industry has led to several regulatory initiatives and could lead to additional regulation in the future. For example, in July 2005, the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Information Industry jointly issued an opinion which requires online game operators to develop systems and softwares for indentity certification, to implement anti-addiction modifications to game rules and to restrict players under eighteen years of age from playing certain games. In August 2005, for example, the State Administration of Press and Publications, or SAPP, proposed an online game anti-addiction system that would have reduced and eliminated experience points that a user can accumulate after three and five hours of consecutive playing, respectively. In March 2006, SAPP amended its proposal to require players to register with their real names and identity card numbers and to apply the anti-addiction system only to players under eighteen years of age. Although the proposal has not yet been formally adopted and compliance is not yet compulsory for online game operators, these and other regulations may be implemented in response to negative publicity and such regulations could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We face significant competition which could reduce our market share and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The online game market in China is increasingly competitive. Our results of operations to date may be a result, in part, of a first-mover advantage which may not continue to be available to us. A significant number of competitors have 11 Table of Contents entered the online game business in China. We expect more companies to enter the market and we expect a wider range of online games to be introduced to the China market. Competition from other online game operators, both based in China as well as overseas, is likely to increase in the future. Other online game operators or developers, such as China-based Netease and The9, as well as overseas-based Electronic Arts and NCsoft, are current, or potential future, competitors. As the online game industry in China is relatively new and constantly evolving, our current or future competitors may compete more successfully as the industry matures. In particular, any of these competitors may offer products and services that provide significant performance, price, creativity or other advantages over those offered by us. These products and services may weaken the market strength of our brand name and achieve greater market acceptance than ours. Furthermore, any of our current or future competitors may be acquired by, receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with, larger, well-established and well-financed companies and therefore obtain significantly greater financial, marketing and game licensing and development resources than we have. In addition, increased competition in the online game industry in China could make it difficult for us to retain existing users and attract new users. Moreover, game consoles that have achieved significant successes in markets other than China have not yet formally entered the market in China due to regulatory and other concerns. If these game consoles, many of which are strengthening their online game features, formally enter the market in China, we would face additional competition. We also compete with other forms of entertainment, such as television and movies. If we are unable to compete effectively in Chinas online game market as well as Chinas entertainment market, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategies, including our EZ initiative, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In 2005, as part of our transition from a pure online game operator to an interactive entertainment media company, we introduced the EZ initiative as an integral part of our home strategy. The EZ initiative involves broadening our interactive entertainment services and content offerings as well as introducing new media platforms over which to deliver our expanded service and content offerings to end users. Our EZ initiative includes introducing new products and services for which there are no established markets. Our ability to successfully implement our EZ initiative will depend upon our success in educating consumers on the value of these new products and services. Many consumers in China may, nonetheless, regard some of the new products as too expensive. In addition, we lack experience and expertise with respect to some of the EZ series products and services. For example, we do not have experience or expertise in distribution, marketing, inventory management or warranty support for consumer electronic products. Although in executing the EZ initiative we will cooperate with consumer electronics manufactures that do have such experience and expertise, our lack of such knowledge internally may prove to be a material disadvantage. We cannot assure you that we will be able to deliver the new EZ series products and services on a commercially viable basis or in a timely manner, or at all. Moreover, execution of the EZ initiative requires a significant amount of managerial time and energy. Pursuit of the EZ initiative, and other growth strategies, may divert senior managements focus away from our core online game business to the detriment of such business. If we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategies, our revenue and profitability will not grow as we expect, which may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The recent change to the revenue model for our leading MMORPGs may reduce the amount of revenue that otherwise would have been generated by these games, thereby negatively affecting our financial condition and results of operations. In late November 2005, we replaced the pay-to-play revenue model with a free-to-play and pay-for in-game value-added services revenue model for three of our leading MMORPGs: Mir II, Woool and Magical Land. Going forward, 12 Table of Contents we will consider adopting this new revenue model for our other existing MMORPGs, depending on the game type and lifecycle. We have also adopted this revenue model for our casual games. Under the new model, end users are able to play the basic functions of these MMORPGs for free and may choose to purchase in-game value-added services, including certain in-game items and premium features, which enhance the game experience. Unaudited revenue generated by these three MMORPGs declined from RMB 320.2 million in the third quarter of 2005, to RMB 220.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, to RMB 216.8 million in the first quarter of 2006. Unaudited deferred revenues, which represents cash received from the purchase of pre-paid cards that have not yet been used to play our games or purchase in-game items and value-added services, declined from RMB 267.2 million in the third quarter of 2005, to RMB 172.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and increased to RMB 206.0 million in the first quarter of 2006. Although we believe that adopting this new revenue model will benefit our company in the long run, we cannot assure that the new revenue model will be successful, or that it will not have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Any material reduction in revenue would have a material and adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations. There are risks associated with our pursuit of growth through acquisitions and strategic investments. In recent years we have pursued, and in the future we may continue to pursue, growth through acquisitions and strategic investments. We acquired or invested in eight businesses in 2004 and 2005 with a total value of US$421.0 million. In May 2005, we completed the second step of a two-step acquisition of Shanghai Haofang Online Information Technology Co., Ltd., or Haofang, at a total purchase price of US$56.0 million. In February 2005, we completed our purchase of an approximately 19.5% stake in Sina Corp, or Sina, at a total purchase price of US$227.6 million. In February 2005, we also completed the purchase of a 29% stake in Actoz, increasing our total stake to approximately 38.1%, at a total purchase price at US$106.1 million. In July 2004, we acquired Hangzhou Bianfeng Software Co., Ltd., or Bianfeng, at a total purchase price of US$20.0 million. For more information on our acquisitions, see Recent Acqusitions in Item 5 Operating and Financial Review and Prospects and  History and Development of the Company  in Item 4 Information on the Company. These acquired or invested companies operate businesses that complement our core online game business or represent related but new lines of business. We may, however, fail to realize the synergies contemplated at the time of executing these transactions, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we completed the purchase of our controlling stake in Actoz, the co-owner of Mir II, in February 2005, for a total consideration of RMB878.0 million (US$106.1 million), which represented an 81% premium over the open market price at the time that we entered into the purchase agreement in October 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2005, however, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of RMB521.5 million (US$64.6 million) to reflect the fair value of our 38.1% stake in Actoz. We recognized the impairment charge primarily as a result of the continued decline in royalties payable to Actoz from our operation of Mir II in China. The decision to recognize impairment was also influenced by the decline in market price for shares of Actoz, which in the fourth quarter of 2005 was determined to be other than temporary, mainly due to the continued decline in Mir II royalties. Additional risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments include the following:  It may be difficult to assimilate the operations and personnel of an acquired business into our own business;  Management information and accounting systems of an acquired business must be integrated into our current systems;  Our management must devote its attention to assimilating the acquired business, which diverts attention from other business concerns; and 13 Table of Contents  We may be unable to complete transactions that we initiate. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to effectively integrate the operation of the acquired companies into our own and achieve the synergies contemplated at the time of entering into these transactions. If we are unable to achieve the synergies contemplated at the time of acquiring these businesses, the carrying value of the acquired companies may not be recoverable. We are required by U.S. GAAP to review the impairment at least on an annual basis. If an impairment is determined and charged to the earnings in our financial statements, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. There have been historical deficiencies with our internal controls, including material weaknesses, and our internal controls require significant improvement. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud or restatement of previously reported financial results, and investor confidence and the market price of our ADSs may be adversely impacted. In the course of their audit of our 2005 operating results, our auditors identified a number of control deficiencies. The substantial majority of these control deficiencies constituted material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in the design or operation of our internal controls that, in our management and independent auditors judgment, could adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data consistent with the assertions of management in the financial statements. For a description of these deficiencies and material weaknesses, see Item 15 Controls and Procedures. We must continue to improve our internal controls. If we fail to timely implement solutions to these control deficiencies and other weaknesses in our internal controls or fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud or prevent potential restatements of or adjustments to previously reported or announced operating results and investor confidence and the market price of our ADSs may be adversely impacted. In addition, at the end of 2006, we will become subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 with respect to the evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and any remedial actions with respect to our internal control over financial reporting or the impact of the same on our operations. If we fail to implement the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, our independent auditors may be unable to provide a written attestation as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs in improving our internal control system and the hiring of additional personnel. Any such action could increase our costs relative to our revenues, thereby reducing our operating margins and could negatively affect the market price of our ADSs. 14 Table of Contents Operation of pirate game servers and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business. We continue to face challenges from pirate game servers, which are game servers that operate unauthorized copies of our online games and permit users to play those games without purchasing pre-paid game cards from us. We have detected the operation by pirate servers of unauthorized copies of various of our leading games. In September 2002, for example, we discovered that the server-end software of Mir II was unlawfully released into the China market. This software leak enabled unauthorized third parties to set up local server networks to operate Mir II, which we believe continue to divert a significant number of users of one of our most popular online games away from us. Although we have made efforts to shutdown pirate servers across China, the intellectual property enforcement regime in China is not as robust as that of the United States, and we continue to face considerable challenges when attempting to enforce our intellectual property rights. Enforcement actions generally require cooperation from local authorities, which are not always willing to use their limited resources to enforce the intellectual property rights of national corporations against individuals or companies in their districts. In addition, detailed comparisons of software codes and litigation proceedings are often necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, which sometimes result in substantial costs. Despite our efforts to shutdown pirate servers, we believe that a significant number of pirate game servers continue to operate unauthorized copies of our online games. The continued operation of our leading games by pirate game servers, or the operation of any new games that we may introduce by pirate servers, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Undetected programming errors or defects in our games and the proliferation of cheating programs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our games may contain undetected programming errors or other defects. In addition, parties unrelated to us may develop Internet cheating programs that enable our users to acquire superior features for their game characters that they would not have otherwise. Furthermore, certain cheating programs could cause the loss of a characters superior features acquired by a user. The occurrence of undetected errors or defects in our games, and our failure to discover and disable cheating programs affecting the fairness of our game environment, could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and detract from the game experience of our users. As a result, such errors, defects and cheating programs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unexpected network interruptions, security breaches or computer virus attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to maintain the satisfactory performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure may cause significant harm to our reputation and our ability to attract and maintain users. We maintain a distributed server network architecture with third party service providers hosting servers in more than one hundred cities throughout China. Most of the servers handling log in, and all servers handling billing and data backup matters for us, are hosted and maintained by third party service providers in Shanghai. We do not maintain full backup for our server network hardware. Major risks involved in such network infrastructure include:  any break-downs or system failures resulting in a sustained shutdown of all or a material portion of our servers, including failures which may be attributable to sustained power shutdowns, or efforts to gain unauthorized access to our systems causing loss or corruption of data or malfunctions of software or hardware; and  any disruption or failure in the national backbone network, which would prevent our users outside Shanghai from logging on to any of our games or other content, or playing the games, for which the servers are all located in Shanghai. 15 Table of Contents In the past, our server network has experienced unexpected outages for several hours and occasional slower performance in a number of locations in China as a result of failures by third party service providers. Our network systems are also vulnerable to damage from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer virus, hackings and similar events. Any network interruption or inadequacy that causes interruptions in the availability of our games or deterioration in the quality of access to our games could reduce our users satisfaction. In addition, any security breach caused by hacking, which involve efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not maintain insurance policies covering losses relating to our systems and we do not have business interruption insurance. Any failure to maintain a stable and efficient distribution and payment network could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Online payment systems in China are in a developmental stage and are not as widely available or acceptable to consumers in China as in the United States. As a result, we rely heavily on a multi-layer distribution and payment network composed of third party distributors for our sales to, and collection of payment from, our users. As we do not enter into long-term agreements with any of our distributors, we cannot assure you that we will continue to maintain favorable relationships with them. If we fail to maintain a stable and efficient distribution and payment network, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The limited use of personal computers in China and the relatively high cost of Internet access with respect to per capita gross domestic product may limit the development of the Internet in China and impede our growth. Although the use of personal computers in China has increased in recent years, the penetration rate for personal computers in China is much lower than in the United States. In addition, despite a decrease in the cost of Internet access in China due to a decrease in the cost of personal computers and the introduction and expansion of broadband access, the cost of personal Internet access, in contrast with Internet access through Internet cafes, remains relatively high in comparison to the average per capita income in China. The limited use of personal computers in China and the relatively high cost of personal Internet access may limit the growth of our business. Furthermore, any Internet access or telecommunications fee increase could reduce the number of users that play our online games. Our business could suffer if we do not successfully manage our growth. Our recent growth has placed significant strain on our management, operational, financial and other resources. For example, the total number of our employees increased from 562 as of December 31, 2003 to 1429 as of December 31, 2004, and to 2392 as of December 31, 2005. In addition, certain of our directors, officers and key employees that have recently joined our company will need time to learn our business and successfully integrate themselves into our company. In addition, as a result of our growth we need to continue to develop and expand our financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to efficiently or effectively manage the growth of our operations, and any failure to do so may limit our future growth and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 16 Table of Contents We depend on our key personnel, and our business and growth prospects may be severely disrupted if we lose their services. Our future success is heavily dependent upon the continued service of our key executives and other key employees. In particular, we rely on the expertise, experience and leadership ability of Tianqiao Chen, our founder, controlling shareholder and chief executive officer, in our business operations, and rely on his personal relationships with our employees, the relevant regulatory authorities, our game and service suppliers and Shanda Networking. We also rely on a number of key technology officers and staff for the development and operation of our online games. In addition, as we expect to focus increasingly on the development of our own online games, we will need to continue attracting and retaining skilled and experienced online game developers to maintain our competitiveness. If one or more of our key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to easily replace them and may incur additional expenses to recruit and train new personnel, our business could be severely disrupted, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, since our industry is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent, we may need to offer higher compensation and other benefits in order to attract and retain key personnel in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain the key personnel that we will need to achieve our business objectives. Furthermore, we do not maintain key-man life insurance for any of our key personnel. The discontinuation of any of the preferential tax treatments or the government financial incentives currently available to us in the PRC could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certain of our PRC companies, including Shengqu, Shanda Networking, Hangzhou Bianfeng and Nanjing Shanda, enjoy preferential tax treatments, in the form of reduced tax rates or tax holidays, provided by the PRC government or its local agencies or bureaus. These four subsidiaries, Shengqu, Shanda Networking, Hangzhou Bianfeng and Nanjing Shanda benefit from a 15% preferential income tax rate. In addition, Shengqu was granted an income tax exemption for 2003 and 2004, followed by a three year tax holiday during which it is subject to a 7.5% preferential income tax rate; Hangzhou Bianfeng was granted an income tax exemption in the second quarter of 2006 for 2005; and Nanjing Shanda was granted an income tax exemption in the third quarter of 2005 for 2005 and 2006. After receiving approval for tax exemption treatment, income tax already paid in 2005 by Hangzhou Bianfeng and Nanjing Shanda prior to receipt of approval has been refunded in the second quarter of 2006 and in the third quarter of 2005, respectively. As a result of these preferential tax treatments, our effective income tax rate for 2005 was 12.1%. Nanjing Shanda must continue to meet a number of financial and non-financial criteria to qualify as a new high technology company for its current and future tax holidays. In 2004 and 2005 we also received aggregate government financial incentives of RMB88.1 million and RMB137.3 million (US$17.0 million), respectively, which were calculated with reference to taxable revenue and taxable income. For Shengqu and Shanda Networking, these incentives have a term of 3 years with respect to incentives granted with reference to taxable revenue on which we pay business tax and 8 years for incentives granted with reference to taxable income on which we pay income tax. Eligibility for the government financial incentives we receive requires that we continue to meet a number of financial and non-financial criteria and our continued qualification is further subject to the discretion of the municipal government. Moreover, the central government or municipal government could determine at any time to immediately eliminate or reduce these government financial incentives, generally with prospective effect. If we had not received these government financial incentives in 2004, our income before income tax expenses, equity in loss of affiliated companies, and minority interests would have been RMB566.2 million, a decrease of 13.5% from the reported amount. If 17 Table of Contents we had not received these government financial incentives in 2005, our income before income tax expenses, equity in loss of affiliated companies, and minority interests would have been RMB664.1 million (US$82.3 million), a decrease of 17.1% from the reported amount. As the receipt of these government financial incentives are subject to periodic time lags and inconsistent municipal government practice on payment times, for so long as we continue to receive these government financial incentives, our net income in a particular quarter may be higher or lower relative to other quarters based on the potentially uneven receipt by us of these government financial incentives in addition to any business or operating related factors we may otherwise experience. We cannot assure you that we will continue to enjoy these preferential tax treatments or government financial incentives in the future. The discontinuation of these preferential tax treatments or government financial incentives could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please see Item 5 for a discussion of the duration of these preferential tax treatments or government financial incentives. The PRC government is now reviewing Chinas tax policies and it is possible that in the near future, the different income tax rates imposed on enterprises of different ownership natures (i.e. state owned, collectively owned, privately owned and foreign-invested) may be unified, which reform may result in higher income tax rates applicable to our PRC companies and therefore could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may become a passive foreign-investment company, or PFIC, which could result in adverse U.S. tax consequences to U.S. investors. Depending upon the value of our ordinary shares and ADSs and the nature of our assets and income over time, we could be classified as a passive foreign-investment company, or PFIC, by the United States Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If we are classified as a PFIC in any taxable year in which you hold our ADSs and you are a U.S. investor, you would generally be taxed at higher ordinary income, rather than lower capital gain rates, if you dispose of ADSs at a gain in a later year, even if we are not a PFIC in that year. In addition, a portion of the tax imposed on your gain would be increased by an interest charge. Moreover, if we were classified as a PFIC in any taxable year, you would not be able to benefit from any preferential tax rate with respect to any dividend distribution that you may receive from us in that year or in the following year. Finally, you would also be subject to special U.S. tax reporting requirements. We believe that we were not a PFIC for the taxable year 2005. Although in the past we have operated our business, and in the future we intend to operate our business, so as to minimize the risk of being classified as a PFIC, there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for the taxable year 2006 and/or later taxable years, as PFIC status is re-tested each year and depends on our assets and income in such year. For example, we would be a PFIC for the taxable year 2006 if the sum of our average market capitalization, which is our share price multiplied by the total amount of our outstanding shares, and our liabilities over that taxable year is not more than twice the value of our cash, cash equivalents, and other assets that are readily converted into cash. We could also be a PFIC for any taxable year if the gross income that we and our subsidiaries earn from investing the portion of the cash raised in our initial public offering and debt offerings that exceed the immediate capital needs of our active online business is substantial in comparison with the gross income from our business operations. We cannot assure you that we will not be a PFIC for 2006 or any future taxable year. For more information on the U.S. tax consequences to you that would result from our classification as a PFIC, please, see the subsection Taxation included in Item 10 Additional Information. 18 Table of Contents We may be required to take significant actions that are contrary to our business objectives to avoid being deemed an investment company as defined under the Investment Company Act. Generally, the Investment Company Act provides that a company is not an investment company and is not required to register under the Investment Company Act as an investment company if:  the company is primarily engaged, directly or through a wholly-owned subsidiary or subsidiaries, in a business or businesses other than those of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities; and  40% or less of the fair market value of the companys assets is represented by investment securities. We believe that we are engaged primarily in the businesses of, among other things, developing and operating online games. In addition, less than 40% of the fair market value of our assets is represented by investment securities. As a result, we believe, that we are not an investment company as that term is defined under the Investment Company Act. We may, however, be required to take significant actions that are contrary to our business objectives to avoid being deemed an investment company in the future. We may, for example, need to hold a significant portion of our assets and invest portions of our cash flows in low-yielding investments or we may need to acquire additional income or loss generating assets that we might not otherwise have acquired. In addition, we may need to sell all or a portion of our minority investments in Actoz or Sina, or forego opportunities to acquire minority interests in other companies that could be important to our strategy. The Investment Company Act also contains substantive regulations with respect to investment companies including restrictions on their capital structure, operations, transactions with affiliates and other matters which would be incompatible with our operations. If we were to be deemed an investment company in the future, we would, among other things, effectively be precluded from making public offerings in the United States. We could also be subject to other adverse consequences. Changes to existing accounting pronouncements, including SFAS 123R, or practices may adversely affect our reported results of operations or how we conduct our business. A change in accounting pronouncements or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. Pursuant to SEC rules, we are required to implement the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Accounting for Share Based Compensation (SFAS 123R) starting in the first quarter of 2006. SFAS 123R requires us to measure compensation costs for all share-based compensation at fair value and take compensation charges equal to that value. The requirement to measure compensation costs for all share-based compensation under SFAS 123R could negatively affect our profitability and the trading price of our ADSs. SFAS 123R and the impact of expensing on our reported results could also limit our ability to continue to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool, which could, in turn, hurt our ability to recruit employees and retain existing employees. Other new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. This change to existing rules, future changes, if any, or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. 19 Table of Contents We have limited business insurance coverage in China. The insurance industry in China is still at an early stage of development. In particular, PRC insurance companies do not offer extensive business insurance products. As a result, we do not have any business liability or disruption insurance coverage for our operations in China. Any business disruption, litigation or natural disaster might result in our incurring substantial costs and the diversion of resources. Risks Relating to Regulation of the Internet and to Our Structure If the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our China business do not comply with PRC government restrictions on foreign investment in the online game industry, we could be subject to severe penalties. PRC regulations currently limit foreign ownership of companies that provide Internet content services, which includes operating online games, to 50%. In addition, foreign and foreign-invested enterprises are currently not able to apply for the licenses required to operate online games in China or to provide Internet information content, such as online advertising. We are a Cayman Islands exempted company and we conduct our operations in China primarily through Shengqu, our indirectly wholly owned subsidiary. We and Shengqu are foreign or foreign-invested enterprises under PRC law and accordingly are ineligible to apply for a license to operate online games or to sell online advertising. In order to comply with foreign ownership restrictions, we operate our online game business in China through Shanda Networking, which is wholly owned by Tianqiao Chen, our chairman and chief executive officer, and Danian Chen, our executive senior vice president, both of whom are PRC citizens, and through Nanjing Shanda and Hangzhou Bianfeng, which are subsidiaries of Shanda Networking. Shanda Networking, Nanjing Shanda, Hangzhou Bianfeng, or our PRC operating companies, and other subsidiaries of Shanda Networking hold the licenses and approvals that are required to operate our online game business and to sell online advertising on our web pages and Shengqu owns the substantial majority of physical assets. Shengqu has entered into a series of contractual arrangements with Shanda Networking and its shareholders. As a result of these contractual arrangements, we are considered the primary beneficiary of Shanda Networking and accordingly we consolidate the results of operations of Shanda Networking and its subsidiaries in our financial statements. For a description of these contractual arrangements, see Organizational Structure in Item 4, Information on the Company and Item 7 Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions. We believe that (1) the ownership structures of our company, Shengqu, and our PRC operating companies are in compliance with existing PRC laws and regulations; (2) our contractual arrangements with Shanda Networking and its shareholders are valid, binding and enforceable, and will not result in any violation of PRC laws or regulations currently in effect; and (3) the business operations of our company, Shengqu, and our PRC operating companies, as described in this annual report, are in compliance with existing PRC laws and regulations in all material aspects. There are, however, substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current or future PRC laws and regulations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the PRC regulatory authorities will not ultimately take a view that is contrary to our view. If we, Shengqu, or any of our PRC operating companies are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, the relevant regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including:  revoking Shengqus or any of our PRC operating companies business and operating licenses;  discontinuing or restricting our, Shengqus or our PRC operating companies operations; 20 Table of Contents  imposing conditions or requirements with which we, Shengqu or our PRC operating companies may not be able to comply;  requiring us, Shengqu or our PRC operating companies to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations; or  taking other regulatory or enforcement actions, including levying fines, that could be harmful to our business. Any of these actions could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer and the price of our ADSs to decline. The contractual arrangements related to critical aspects of our operations with Shanda Networking and its shareholders, Tianqiao Chen and Danian Chen, may not be as effective in providing operational control as direct ownership. We rely on contractual arrangements with Shanda Networking and its shareholders, Tianqiao Chen and Danian Chen, to operate our business. These contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us control over PRC operating companies. Direct ownership would allow us, for example, to directly exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect changes in the board of Shanda Networking, which, in turn, could effect changes, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations, at the management level. However, under the current contractual arrangements, as a legal matter, if Shanda Networking or Tianqiao Chen or Danian Chen fails to perform its, his or her respective obligations under these contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend significant resources to enforce those arrangements and rely on legal remedies under PRC law. These remedies may include seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages, any of which may not be effective. All of these contractual arrangements are governed by PRC laws and provide for the resolution of disputes through either arbitration or litigation in the PRC. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC laws and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal environment in the PRC is not as developed as in other jurisdictions, such as the United States. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. In the event we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, we may be unable to exert effective control over our PRC operating companies, and our ability to conduct our business may be negatively affected. The entire share capital of Shanda Networking is held by our controlling shareholders, who may cause the agreements between our company and Shanda Networking to be amended in a manner that is adverse to us. We conduct substantially all of our operations, and generate substantially all of our revenues, through our PRC operating companies. Our control over these entities is based upon contractual arrangements with Shanda Networking and its shareholders that provide us with the substantial ability to control Shanda Networking. The two shareholders of Shanda Networking, Tianqiao Chen and Danian Chen, are also our controlling shareholders. As a result, Tianqiao Chen and Danian Chen may be able to cause these agreements to be amended in a manner that will be adverse to our company, or may be able to prevent these agreements from being renewed, even if their renewal would be beneficial for us. Although we have entered into an agreement that prevents the amendment of these agreements without the approval of our audit committee, which is comprised of independent directors, we can provide no assurances that these agreements will not be amended in the future to contain terms that may be adverse to our interests. 21 Table of Contents Our arrangements with our PRC operating companies may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities for transfer pricing adjustments. We also could face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that our contracts with our PRC operating companies were not entered into based on arms length negotiations. Although we based our contractual arrangements on those of similar businesses, if the PRC tax authorities determine that these contracts were not entered into on an arms length basis, they may adjust our income and expenses for PRC tax purposes in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. A transfer pricing adjustment could result in a reduction, for PRC tax purposes, of deductions recorded by our PRC operating companies, which could adversely affect us by:  increasing our PRC operating companies tax liability without reducing Shengqus tax liability, which could further result in late payment fees and other penalties to our PRC operating companies for under-paid taxes; or  limiting Shengqus ability to maintain preferential tax treatments and government financial incentives, which if the transfer pricing adjustment is significant, could result in Shengqu failing to qualify for those preferential tax treatments and government financial incentives. As a result, any transfer pricing adjustment could have a material and adverse impact upon our financial condition. Our corporate structure may restrict our ability to receive dividends from, and transfer funds to, our PRC subsidiary and our PRC operating companies, which could restrict our ability to act in response to changing market conditions and reallocate funds from one Chinese affiliated entity to another in a timely manner. We are a Cayman Islands holding company and substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiary, Shengqu, and our PRC operating companies. We rely principally on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by Shengqu for our cash requirements, including the funds necessary to allow us to pay dividends on the shares underlying our ADSs and the funds necessary to service any debt we may incur, or financing we may need for operations other than through Shengqu. If Shengqu incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict Shengqus ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to the intermediate holding company and thus to us. We generate substantially all of our revenues through contractual arrangements with our PRC operating companies. However, PRC governmental authorities may require us to amend these contractual arrangements in a manner that would materially and adversely affect Shengqus ability to pay dividends and other distributions to us. Furthermore, PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividends by Shengqu only out of its retained earnings, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Under PRC law, Shengqu is also required to set aside a portion of its net income each year to fund certain reserve funds. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. As a result of these and other restrictions under PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiary and our affiliated PRC entities are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to us in the form of dividends, loans or advances, which restricted portion amounted to approximately RMB1,081.6 million (US$134.0 million), or 66.0%, of our total consolidated net assets as of December 31, 2005. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiary and our affiliated PRC entities to transfer funds to 22 Table of Contents us in the form of dividends, loans or advances could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our businesses, pay debt or dividends, and otherwise fund and conduct our business. In addition, any transfer of funds from us to our PRC subsidiary, either as a shareholder loan or as an increase in registered capital, is subject to registration or approval of Chinese governmental authorities, including the relevant administration of foreign exchange and/or the relevant examining and approval authority. It is not permitted under PRC law for our PRC subsidiary and our PRC operating companies to directly lend money to each other. Therefore, it is difficult to change our capital expenditure plans once the relevant funds have been remitted from our company to our PRC subsidiary and PRC operating companies. These limitations on the free flow of funds between us and our PRC entities could restrict our ability to act in response to changing market conditions and reallocate funds from one Chinese entity to another in a timely manner. Recent PRC regulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC residents may increase the administrative burden we face and create regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our overseas and cross border investment activity, and a failure by our shareholders who are PRC residents to make any required applications and filings pursuant to such regulations may prevent us from being able to distribute profits and could expose us and our PRC resident shareholders to liability under PRC law. Regulations were recently promulgated by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, that require registration with local SAFE offices in connection with direct or indirect offshore investment by PRC residents, including PRC individual residents and PRC corporate entities. These regulations apply to our shareholders who are PRC residents and also apply to our prior and future offshore acquisitions. In particular, the SAFE regulations require PRC Residents to file with competent SAFE offices information about offshore companies in which they have directly or indirectly invested and to make follow-up filings in connection with certain material transactions involving such offshore companies, such as increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, mergers or divisions, long-term equity or debt investments, or external guarantees, or other material events that do not involve return investment. The SAFE regulations retroactively require registration by March 31, 2006 of direct or indirect investments previously made by PRC residents in offshore companies. If a PRC resident with a direct or indirect stake in an offshore parent company fails to make the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of such offshore parent company may be prohibited from making distributions of profit to the offshore parent and from paying the offshore parent proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation in respect of the PRC subsidiaries. Further, failure to comply with various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for foreign exchange evasion. Our major shareholders who are PRC residents, or whose shares are beneficially owned by PRC residents, have completed foreign exchange registration with the local Shanghai Foreign Exchange Bureau according to these SAFE regulations. As a result of the newness of the regulations and uncertainty concerning the reconciliation of the new regulations with other approval requirements, it remains unclear how the regulations, and any future legislation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions, will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant government authorities. We are committed to complying and to ensuring that our shareholders who are subject to the regulations comply with the relevant rules. However, we cannot assure you that all of our shareholders who are PRC residents will comply with our request to make or obtain any applicable registrations or approvals required by the regulations or other related legislation. The failure or inability of our PRC resident shareholders to receive any required approvals or make any required registrations may subject us to fines and legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross border investment activities, limit our 23 Table of Contents PRC subsidiary, Shengqu, to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, as a result of which our acquisition strategy and business operations and our ability to distribute dividend to you could be materially and adversely affected. The laws and regulations governing the online game industry and related businesses in China are developing and subject to future changes. If we or any of our PRC operating companies fail to obtain or maintain all applicable permits and approvals, our business and operations would be materially and adversely affected. The Internet industry, including the operation of online games, in China is highly regulated by the PRC government. Various regulatory authorities of the central PRC government, such as the State Council, the Ministry of Information Industry, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Culture, the State Press and Publication Administration, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, and the Ministry of Public Security, are empowered to issue and implement regulations governing various aspects of the Internet and online game industries. Our PRC operating companies are required to obtain applicable permits or approvals from different regulatory authorities in order to provide their services. For example, an Internet content provider, or ICP, must obtain an ICP license from the Ministry of Information Industry in order to engage in any commercial ICP operations within China. An online game operator must also obtain a license from the Ministry of Culture and a license from the State Press and Publication Administration in order to distribute games through the Internet. In addition, in connection with our launch of certain EZ series products, which offer video and audio content, such as music and movies, our PRC operating companies may need to obtain a license from the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television. We understand, however, that companies that are not state-owned may not be able to obtain such license. If any of our PRC operating companies fails to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals, they may be subject to various penalties, including fines and the discontinuation or restriction of their operations. Any such disruption in business operations would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We currently operate a large number of websites, the domain names of which are registered under the names of Shengqu and our other PRC-incorporated affiliates. In order to streamline and optimize our Internet publication businesses, we have started to put all of our Internet publication businesses, including our editing, content supervision, publication, and other related businesses, under Shanda Networking. We have reported to the Ministry of Information Industry of the change and Shanda Networking has applied to the State Press and Publications Administration for expanding its Internet publication license from the publication of online games to encompass books, newspapers, periodicals, music and video products, works in the fields of literature, art, natural science, social science, engineering, and other electronic publications. We believe that Shanda Networking has satisfied all qualifications required to obtain the permission for license expansion and we do not believe that, while its application is pending, the regulatory authorities will take any action against it. However, we cannot assure you that it will obtain this approval or that the regulatory authority will not take any action against it. As the online game industry is at an early stage of development in China, new laws and regulations may be adopted in the future to address new issues that arise from time to time, such as online advertising. Also, different regulatory authorities may have different opinions with regard to the licensing requirements imposed on online game operators. As a result, substantial uncertainties exist regarding the interpretation and implementation of current and any future PRC laws and regulations applicable to the online game industry and related businesses. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable PRC laws and regulations currently in effect, we cannot assure you that we will not be found in violation of any current or future PRC laws and regulations. 24 Table of Contents The PRC government may prevent us from distributing, and we may be subject to liability for, content that it believes is inappropriate. China has enacted laws and regulations governing Internet access and the distribution of news, information or other content, as well as products and services, through the Internet. In the past, the PRC government has stopped the distribution of information through the Internet that it believes violates PRC law. The Ministry of Information Industry, the State Press and Publication Administration and the Ministry of Culture have promulgated regulations that prohibit games from being distributed through the Internet if the games contain content that is found to, among other things, propagate obscenity, gambling or violence, instigate crimes, undermine public morality or the cultural traditions of the PRC, or compromise State security or secrets. In addition, certain PRC social organizations have recently discussed the possibility of implementing a rating system for online games. The effect that such a system could have on our business is unclear. If any games we offer were deemed to violate any such content restrictions, we would not be able to continue such offerings and could be subject to penalties, including confiscation of income, fines, suspension of business and revocation of our license for operating online games, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject to potential liability for unlawful actions of our users or for content we distribute that is deemed inappropriate. Furthermore, we may be required to delete content that violates the laws of the PRC and report content that we suspect may violate PRC law. It may be difficult to determine the type of content that may result in liability for us, and if we are wrong, we may be prevented from operating our games or other services in China. The PRC government has announced its intention, and has begun, to intensify its regulation of Internet cafes, which are currently the primary venue for our users to play online games. Intensified government regulation of Internet cafes could restrict our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and expand our customer base. In April 2001, the PRC government began tightening its regulation and supervision of Internet cafes. In particular, a large number of unlicensed Internet cafes have been closed. The PRC government has also imposed higher capital and facility requirements for the establishment of Internet cafes. Furthermore, the PRC governments policy, which encourages the development of a limited number of national and regional Internet cafe chains and discourages the establishment of independent Internet cafes, may slow down the growth of Internet cafes. Moreover, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce, one of the government agencies in charge of Internet cafe licensing, and other government agencies jointly issued a notice in February 2004 suspending the issuance of new Internet cafe licenses for a period of six months. Although the six-month period is over, in practice, to obtain a license for setting up a new Internet café remains very difficult. It is unclear when this suspension will be lifted, if at all. So long as Internet cafes are the primary venue for our users to play online games, any reduction in the number, or slowdown in the growth, of Internet cafes in China, or any new regulatory restrictions on their operations, could limit our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and expand our customer base, thereby reducing our profitability and growth prospects. 25 Table of Contents Currently there are no laws or regulations in the PRC specifically governing virtual asset property rights and therefore, it is not clear what liabilities, if any, online game operators may have for virtual assets. In the course of playing online games, some virtual assets, such as special equipment, player experience grades and other features of our users game characters, are acquired and accumulated. Such virtual assets can be important to online game players and in some cases are exchanged between players for monetary value. In practice, virtual assets can be lost for various reasons, often through unauthorized use of the game account of one user by other users and occasionally through data loss caused by a delay of network service or by a network crash. Currently there are no PRC laws and regulations specifically governing virtual asset property rights. As a result, it is unclear who is the legal owner of virtual assets and whether and how the ownership of virtual assets is protected by law. In case of a loss of virtual assets, we may be sued by online game players and may be held liable for damages, which may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to the Peoples Republic of China Substantially all of our assets are located in China and substantially all of our revenues are derived from our operations in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are subject, to a significant extent, to economic, political and legal developments in China. The PRCs economic, political and social conditions, as well as government policies, could affect our business. The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including in the amount of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While the PRC economy has experienced significant growth over the past twenty-five years, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The PRC government has implemented numerous measures to encourage economic growth and to guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall PRC economy, but also have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us. The PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. Although the PRC government has implemented measures since the late 1970s emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of sound corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the PRC government. In addition, the PRC government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The PRC government also exercises significant control over Chinas economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. These actions, as well as future actions and policies of the PRC government, could materially affect general economic conditions in China and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The PRC legal system embodies uncertainties which could limit the legal protections available to you and us. The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it is a system in which decided legal cases have little precedential value. In 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing general economic and business matters. The overall effect of 26 Table of Contents legislation over the past 26 years has been a significant enhancement of the protections afforded to various forms of foreign-invested enterprises in mainland China. Our PRC operating subsidiary, Shengqu, is a wholly foreign owned enterprise, or WFOE, which is an enterprise incorporated in mainland China and wholly-owned by foreign investors. Shengqu is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in mainland China in general and laws and regulations applicable to WFOEs in particular. However, these laws, regulations and legal requirements are constantly changing, and their interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us and other foreign investors, including you. In addition, we cannot predict the effect of future developments in the PRC legal system, particularly with regard to the Internet, including the promulgation of new laws, changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, or the preemption of local regulations by national laws. Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively. Substantially all of our revenues and operating expenses are denominated in Renminbi. The Renminbi is currently freely convertible under the current account, which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the capital account, which includes foreign direct investment and loans. Currently, Shengqu may purchase foreign exchange for settlement of current account transactions, including payment of dividends to us and payment of license fees to foreign game licensors, and our PRC operating companies may purchase foreign exchange for payment of license fees to foreign game licensors without the approval of the State Administration for Foreign Exchange. Shengqu may also retain foreign exchange in its current account, subject to a ceiling approved by the State Administration for Foreign Exchange, to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. However, we cannot assure you that the relevant PRC governmental authorities will not limit or eliminate our ability to purchase and retain foreign currencies in the future. Since a significant amount of our future revenues will be denominated in Renminbi, the existing and any future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenues generated in Renminbi to fund our business activities outside China, if any, or expenditures denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account are subject to limitations and require registration with or approval by the relevant PRC governmental authorities. In particular, if we finance Shengqu by means of foreign currency loans, those loans cannot exceed certain statutory limits and must be registered with the State Administration for Foreign Exchange, and if we finance Shengqu by means of capital contributions, those capital contributions must be approved by the Ministry of Commerce. Our ability to use the U.S. dollar proceeds of the sale of our equity or debt to finance our business activities conducted through Shengqu will depend on our ability to obtain these governmental registrations or approvals. In addition, because of the regulatory issues related to foreign currency loans to, and foreign investment in, domestic PRC enterprises, we may not be able to finance Shanda Networking or its subsidiaries operations by loans or capital contributions. We cannot assure you that we can obtain these governmental registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Fluctuations in exchange rates could result in foreign currency exchange losses. Substantially all of our revenues are denominated in Renminbi, while a portion of our expenditures are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly those involving the U.S. dollar, 27 Table of Contents may affect our costs and operating margins. In addition, these fluctuations could result in exchange losses and increased costs in Renminbi terms. Where our operations conducted in Renminbi are reported in dollars, such fluctuations could result in changes in reported results which do not reflect changes in the underlying operations. Since January 1, 1994, the PRC government has used a unitary managed floating rate system. Under that system, the Peoples Bank of China, or PBOC, publishes a daily base exchange rate with reference primarily to the supply and demand of Renminbi against U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies in the market during the previous day. Authorized banks and financial institutions are allowed to quote buy and sell rates for Renminbi within a specified bank around the central banks daily exchange rate. On July 21, 2005, PBOC announced an adjustment of the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to Renminbi from 1:8.27 to 1:8.11 and modified the system by which the exchange rates are determined. This adjustment has resulted in an approximate 3.0% appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar as of March 21, 2006 when compared with the exchange rate in effect in March, 2005. While the international reaction to the Renminbi revaluation has generally been positive, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further reevaluation and a significant fluctuation of the exchange rate of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar, including possible devaluations. As substantially all of our revenues are denominated in Renminbi, such a potential future devaluation of Renminbi against the U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations. Moreover, we do have material monetary assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars, which mainly consists of the investments in marketable securities, affiliated companies and the convertible notes payable. The fluctuation of foreign exchange rate affects the value of these monetary assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars. Generally, appreciation of Renminbi against U.S. dollars results in a foreign exchange loss for monetary assets denominated in U.S. dollars, and a foreign exchange gain for monetary liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars. On the contrary, devaluation of Renminbi against U.S. dollars results in a foreign exchange gain for monetary assets denominated in U.S. dollars, and a foreign exchange loss for monetary liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars. Very limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert Renminbi into U.S. dollars. Conversely, an increase in the value of the Renminbi could increase our reported earnings in U.S. dollar terms without a fundamental change in our business or operating performance. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in Renminbi, our valuation could be materially and adversely affected by the devaluation of the Renminbi if U.S. investors analyze our value based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain of our acquisitions may expose us to additional currency fluctuations that would affect our reported valuation of those holdings. Actoz, which we will account for under the equity method, is a South Korean company; changes in its valuation as a consequence of fluctuations in the Korean Won would be reflected in our valuation. Inflation in China could negatively affect our profitability and growth. While the PRC economy has experienced rapid growth, such growth has been uneven among various sectors of the economy and in different geographical areas of the country. Rapid economic growth can lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. If prices for our products and services rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for the rise in our costs, our business may be materially and adversely affected. In order to control inflation in the past, the PRC government has imposed controls on bank credits, limits on loans for fixed assets, and restrictions on state bank lending. Such austerity measures can lead to a slowing of economic growth. A slow down in the PRC economy could also materially and adversely affect our business and prospects. 28 Table of Contents You may experience difficulties in effecting service of process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in China based on United States or other foreign laws against us, our management or the experts named in the prospectus. We conduct substantially all of our operations in China and substantially all of our assets are located in China. In addition, most of our directors and executive officers reside within China. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States or elsewhere outside China upon some of our directors and senior executive officers, including with respect to matters arising under U.S. federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws. Moreover, the PRC does not have treaties with the United States or many other countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgment of courts. Any future outbreak of avian flu or severe acute respiratory syndrome in China or similar adverse public health developments may severely disrupt our business and operations. Adverse public health epidemics or pandemics could disrupt businesses and national economies in China. For example, from December 2002 to June 2003, China and certain other countries experienced an outbreak of a new and highly contagious form of atypical pneumonia now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. During May and June of 2003, many businesses in China were closed by the PRC government to prevent transmission of SARS. The World Health Organization has announced that there is a high likelihood of an outbreak of avian flu, with the potential to be as disruptive if not more disruptive than SARS. Any recurrence of the SARS outbreak, an avian flu outbreak, or development of a similar health hazard in China, may have disruptive effects on consumer spending. In addition, health or other government regulation may require temporary closure of our offices and operations. Such outbreak may also cause the sickness or death of our key management and employees. Any of such occurrences would adversely affect our business and results of operations. Risks Relating to our ADSs One shareholder has significant control over the outcome of our shareholder votes. As of March 31, 2006, Skyline Media beneficially owned approximately 57% of our outstanding equity interests. Accordingly, Skyline Media has and is expected to maintain significant control over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our shareholders for approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. If our controlling shareholder, Skyline Media ,which holds approximately 57% of our ordinary shares, chose to dispose of a material portion of the ordinary shares that it holds, the prevailing market price for our securities may decline. As of March 31, 2006, Skyline Media beneficially owned 81,070,090 of our ordinary shares, representing approximately 57% of our outstanding ordinary shares. The beneficial owners of Skyline Media are Tianqiao Chen, our chairman and chief executive officer, Danian Chen, our executive senior vice president and the brother of Tianqiao Chen, and Qianqian Luo, our director and the wife of Tianqiao Chen. Tianqiao Chen and Qianqian Luo beneficially own an additional 1,866,338 of our ordinary shares through DBS Trustees Ltd as trustee for the Jade Trust and Danian Chen beneficially owns an additional 951,170 of our ordinary shares through DBS Trustees Ltd as trustee for the Chifeng Trust. 29 Table of Contents In June 2005, Jade Trust adopted pre-arranged stock trading plans in accordance with Rule10b5-1 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Companys trading policy with respect to sales of the Companys securities by insiders. As of March 31, 2006, 322,000 ordinary shares had been sold pursuant to the 10b5-1 plan, which will expire on August 15, 2006 if it is not renewed. If Skyline Media chooses to sell a material portion of the ordinary shares that it holds, or indicate its intention to do so, the prevailing market price for our securities may decline. The price of our ADSs has been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile, which may make it difficult for holders to resell the ADSs when desired or at attractive prices. The trading price of our ADSs has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Since we completed our initial public offering in May 2004, the sale prices of our ADSs on the Nasdaq National Market ranged from US$10.58 to US$45.40 per ADS and the last reported sale price on June 26, 2006 was US$13.71. Our ADS price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors. In addition, the financial markets in general, and the market prices for Internet-related companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our ADSs, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, the existence of our Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Notes due 2014 that we issued in October 2004, or the convertible notes, may encourage short selling in our ADSs by market participants because the conversion of the convertible notes could depress the price of our ADSs. You may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and our ability to protect our rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited, because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law. Our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association and by the Companies Law (2004 Revision) and common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of company law as compared to the U.S., and provides significantly less protection to investors. Therefore, our shareholders may have more difficulties in protecting their interests in the face of actions by our management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the United States. As a result, our ability to protect our interests if we are harmed in a manner that would otherwise enable us to sue in a United States federal court may be limited. Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents may discourage our acquisition by a third party, which could limit your opportunity to sell your shares at a premium. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association include provisions that could limit the ability of others to acquire control of us, modify our structure or cause us to engage in change of control transactions, including, among other things, the following:  provisions that restrict the ability of our shareholders to call meetings and to propose special matters for consideration at shareholder meetings; and 30 Table of Contents  provisions that authorize our board of directors, without action by our shareholders, to issue preferred shares and to issue additional ordinary shares, including ordinary shares represented by ADSs. These provisions could have the effect of depriving you of an opportunity to sell your ADSs at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to acquire control of us in a tender offer or similar transactions. The voting rights of holders of ADSs are limited by the terms of the deposit agreement. A holder of our ADSs may only exercise the voting rights with respect to the underlying ordinary shares in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement. Upon receipt of voting instructions of a holder of ADSs in the manner set forth in the deposit agreement, the depositary will endeavor to vote the underlying ordinary shares in accordance with these instructions. Under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and Cayman Islands law, the minimum notice period required for convening a general meeting is ten days. When a general meeting is convened, you may not receive sufficient notice of a shareholders meeting to permit you to withdraw your ordinary shares to allow you to cast your vote with respect to any specific matter. In addition, the depositary and its agents may not be able to send voting instructions to you or carry out your voting instructions in a timely manner. We will make all reasonable efforts to cause the depositary to extend voting rights to you in a timely manner, but we cannot assure you that you will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that you can instruct the depositary to vote your shares. Furthermore, the depositary and its agents will not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instructions to vote, for the manner in which any vote is cast, or for the effect of any such vote. As a result, you may not be able to exercise your right to vote and you may lack recourse if your ordinary shares are not voted as you requested. You may be subject to limitations on transfer of your ADSs Your ADSs represented by American Depositary Receipts are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties. The depositary may close its books for a number of reasons, including in connection with corporate events such as a rights offering, during which time the depositary needs to maintain an exact number of ADS holders on its books for a specified period. The depositary may also close its books in emergencies, and on weekends and public holidays. The depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer, or register transfers of our ADSs generally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary thinks it is advisable to do so because of any requirement of law or any government or governmental body, or under any provision of the deposit agreement, or for any other reason. Your right as a holder of ADSs to participate in any future rights offerings may be limited, which may cause dilution to your holdings. We may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities. However, we cannot make rights available to our ADS holders in the United States unless we register the rights and the securities to which the rights relate under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements is available. In addition, the deposit agreement provides that the depositary bank will not make rights available to you unless the distribution to ADS holders of both the rights and any related securities are either registered under the Securities Act or exempted from registration under the Securities Act. We are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or securities or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective. Moreover, we may not be 31 Table of Contents able to establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, ADS holders may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in their holdings. In addition, if the depositary is unable to sell rights that are not exercised or not distributed or if the sale is not lawful or reasonably practicable, it will allow the rights to lapse, in which case you will receive no value for these rights. Risks Relating to our Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Notes We may not have the ability to repurchase our Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Notes in cash if holders exercise their repurchase rights on October 15, 2007. In October 2004, we issued US$275 million Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Notes, or the convertible notes. The holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on October 15, 2007 at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any. As of March 31, 2006, we had RMB817.3 million (US$101.3 million) in cash and cash equivalents, RMB68.1 million (US$8.4 million) in short-term investment and RMB2,211.8 million (US$274.1 million)in marketable securities, which includes our minority investments in Sina Corporation, or Sina. The trading prices for the securities have been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Financial markets in general, and the market price for Internet-related companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that is often unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. In addition, the relatively large size of our investments in Sina may inhibit our ability to sell as many of these securities as we might want to sell at an acceptable price or at all. If our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for repurchase of the notes, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased interest rate risk and debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot assure you, however, that future financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. As a result, we may not have sufficient funds to make the required repurchase in cash. Our failure to repurchase tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the Indenture for the notes, which might constitute a default under any other obligations we may have at that time.
