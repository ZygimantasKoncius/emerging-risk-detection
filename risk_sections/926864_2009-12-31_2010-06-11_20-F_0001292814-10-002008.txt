Risk Factors. South American economic fluctuations are likely to affect our results from operations. All of our operations are located in five South American countries. Accordingly, our consolidated revenues are sensitive to the performance of South American economies as a whole. If local, regional or worldwide economic trends adversely affect the economy of any of the five countries in which we have investments or operations, our financial condition and results from operations could be adversely affected. The South American financial and securities markets are, to varying degrees, influenced by economic and market conditions in other emerging market countries. Although economic conditions are different in each country, investor reaction to developments in one country may have a significant effect on the securities of issuers in other countries, including Chile. Chilean financial and securities markets may be adversely affected by events in other countries and such effects may affect the value of our securities. Moreover, we have significant investments in relatively risky countries such as Argentina. Generation and distribution of cash from such subsidiaries in these countries have proven to be volatile. 11 Table of Contents Our business is particularly dependent on the Chilean economy and our revenues are sensitive to its performance. A substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in Chile and, accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations are to a certain extent dependent upon economic conditions prevailing in Chile. In 2009, the Chilean GDP decreased by 1.5% compared to a 3.7% increase in 2008. The latest Chilean Central Bank estimate for growth in 2010 is in the 4.25% - 5.25% range. However, there is no assurance that such growth will be achieved, that the growth trend will be resumed in the future, or that future developments in the Chilean economy will not impair our ability to proceed with our strategic plans or adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. Our financial condition and results from operations could also be adversely affected by ch anges in economic or other policies of the Chilean government, which has exercised and continues to exercise a substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. In addition, our financial condition and results of operations could also be affected by other political or economic developments in Chile, a well as regulatory changes or administrative practices of Chilean authorities, over which we have no control. Certain South American economies have been characterized by frequent and occasionally drastic intervention by governmental authorities, which may adversely affect our business. Governmental authorities have changed monetary, credit, tariff and other policies to influence the course of the economies of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. These governmental actions, intended to control inflation and affect other policies, have often involved wage, price and tariff rate controls as well as other interventionist measures, which in Argentina included freezing bank accounts and imposing capital restrictions in 2001, the nationalization of the private sector pension funds in 2008, and the use of Central Bank reserves of the Argentine Treasury in order to pay down indebtedness maturing in 2010. Changes in the policies of these governmental authorities with respect to tariff rates, exchange controls, regulations and taxation could adversely affect our business and financial results, as could inflation, devalua tion, social instability and other political, economic or diplomatic developments, including the response by governments in the region to these circumstances. If governmental authorities intervene materially in any of the countries in which we operate, it could cause our business to become less profitable, and our results from operations may be adversely affected. Our electricity business is subject to risks arising from natural disasters, catastrophic accidents and acts of terrorism which could adversely affect our operations, earnings and cash flow. Our primary facilities include power plants and their associated transmission lines, pipelines, LNG terminals and re‑gasification plants, storage and chartered LNG tankers. Our facilities may be damaged by earthquakes, flooding, fires, other catastrophic disasters arising from natural or accidental human causes, as well as acts of terrorism. For example, on February 27, 2010, Chile experienced a major earthquake measuring 8.8 on the Richter scale, followed by a tsunami. Notwithstanding our insurance policies regarding these events, we could still experience severe business disruptions, significant decreases in revenues based on lower demand arising from catastrophic events, or significant additional costs to us not otherwise covered by business interruption insurance clauses. Ther e may be an important time lag between a major accident or catastrophic event and our definitive recovery from our insurance policies, which typically carry non‑recoverable deductible amounts, and in any event are subject to caps per event. Some of these considerations, among others, could lead to an adverse effect on our operations, earnings and cash flow. For information on the February 27, 2010 earthquake in Chile, please see 
