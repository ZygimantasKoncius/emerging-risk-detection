RISK FACTORS There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, including our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other factors discussed in the risk factors, described below. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business. If any of the events described in the following risk factors occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the events described in these risks. If a significant number of clients fail to perform under their loans, our business, profitability, and financial condition would be adversely affected. As a lender, the largest risk we face is the possibility that a significant number of our client borrowers will fail to pay their loans when due. If borrower defaults cause losses in excess of our allowance for loan losses, it could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability, and financial condition. We have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Although this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the establishment of loan losses are dependent to a great extent on our experience and judgment. Although we believe that our allowance for loan losses is at a level adequate to absorb any inherent losses in our loan portfolio, we cannot assure you that we will not further increase the allowance for loan losses or that regulators will not require us to increase this allowance. 23 Our current level of interest rate spread may decline in the future. A major portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rates we receive on interest-earning assets, such as loans we extend to our clients and securities held in our investment portfolio. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, such as inflation, recession, global economic disruptions, and unemployment. Between December 31, 2000 and December 31, 2003, the federal funds target rate declined by 550 basis points. Consequently, our quarterly net interest margin decreased by 221 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2000 to the fourth quarter of 2003. In addition, legislative changes could affect the manner in which we pay interest on deposits or other liabilities. Congress has for many years debated repealing a law that prohibits banks from paying interest rates on checking accounts. If this law were to be repealed, we would be subject to competitive pressure to pay interest on our clients’ checking accounts, which would negatively affect our interest rate spread. Any material decline in our interest rate spread would have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability. The holders of recently issued debentures have rights that are senior to those of our shareholders. In December 2002, the Bank issued $10 million of 2002 Junior Subordinated Debentures. In the past three years, Wilshire Bancorp, as a wholly-owned subsidiary in 2003 and as a parent company of the Bank in 2005, issued a total of $51,547,000 of Junior Subordinated Debentures in connection with a $50,000,000 trust preferred securities issuance by statutory trusts wholly-owned by Wilshire Bancorp. The purpose of these transactions was to raise additional capital. The Junior Subordinated Debentures are senior to the shares of our common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the debentures before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holder of the debentures must be paid in full before any distributions may be made to the holders of our common stock. We have the right to defer distributions on the 2003 and 2005 Junior Subordinated Debentures for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of our common stock. In the event that the Bank is unable to make capital contributions to Wilshire Bancorp, then we may be unable to pay the amounts due to the holder of the 2003 and 2005 Junior Subordinated Debentures and, thus, we would be unable to declare and pay any dividends on our common stock. Adverse changes in domestic or global economic conditions, especially in California, could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, and profitability. If conditions worsen in the domestic or global economy, especially in California, our business, growth and profitability are likely to be materially adversely affected. A substantial number of our clients are geographically concentrated in California, and adverse economic conditions in California, particularly in the Los Angeles area, could harm the businesses of a disproportionate number of our clients. To the extent that our clients’ underlying businesses are harmed, they are more likely to default on their loans. We can provide no assurance that conditions in the California economy will not deteriorate in the future and that such deterioration will not adversely affect us. Maintaining or increasing our market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer demand. There is increasing pressure on financial services companies to provide products and services at lower prices. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including Internet-based services, could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products or services. A failure to achieve market acceptance of any new products we introduce, or a failure to introduce products that the market may demand, could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability, or growth prospects. Significant reliance on loans secured by real estate may increase our vulnerability to downturns in the California real estate market and other variables impacting the value of real estate. A substantial portion of our assets consist of loans secured by real estate in California. At December 31, 2005, approximately 81.5% of our loans were secured by real estate. Conditions in the California real estate market historically have influenced the level of our non-performing assets. A real estate recession in Southern California could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, California has experienced, on occasion, significant natural disasters, including earthquakes, brush fires and, during early 1998, flooding attributed to the weather phenomenon known as “El Nino.” The availability of insurance for losses from such catastrophes is limited. The occurrence of one or more of such catastrophes could impair the value of the collateral for our real estate secured loans and adversely affect us. In recent years, real estate prices in Southern California rose precipitously. If real estate prices were to fall in Southern California, the security for many of our real estate secured loans could be reduced and we could incur significant losses if borrowers of real estate secured loans default, and the value of our collateral is insufficient to cover our losses. 24 If we fail to retain our key employees, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected. Our future success depends in large part upon the continuing contributions of our key management personnel. If we lose the services of one or more key employees within a short period of time, we could be adversely affected. Our future success is also dependent upon our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for such employees among financial institutions in California is intense. Our inability to attract and retain additional key personnel could adversely affect us. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to retain any of our key officers and employees or attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. However, we have entered into an employment agreement with Soo Bong Min, our President and Chief Executive Officer, which continues until June 1, 2007. We may be unable to manage future growth. We may encounter problems in managing our future growth. Our total assets at December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $1.67 billion, $1.27 billion, and $983 million, respectively, representing an increase of $282.4 million or 29.2%, in 2004 and $401 million, or 31.5% in 2005. We currently intend to open additional “de novo” branches and loan production offices and to investigate opportunities to acquire or combine with other financial institutions that would complement our existing business, as such opportunities may arise. No assurance can be provided, however, that we will be able to identify a suitable acquisition target or consummate any such acquisition. Further, our ability to manage growth will depend primarily on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, monitor operations, maintain earnings and control costs. Any failure by us to accomplish these goals could result in interruptions in our business plans and could also adversely affect current operations. Increases in our allowance for loan losses could materially affect our earnings adversely. Like all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and non-performance. Our allowance for loan losses is based on prior experience, as well as an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio. However, actual loan losses could increase significantly as the result of changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which are generally beyond our control. Thus, such losses could exceed our current allowance estimates. Although we believe that our allowance for loan losses is at a level adequate to absorb any inherent losses in our loan portfolio, we cannot assure you that we will not further increase the allowance for loan losses or that regulators will not require us to increase this allowance. Either of these occurrences could materially affect our earnings adversely. In addition, the FDIC and the California Department of Financial Institutions, as an integral part of their respective supervisory functions, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such regulatory agencies may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge-offs, based upon judgments different from those of management. Any increase in our allowance required by the FDIC or the DFI could adversely affect us. We could be liable for breaches of security in our online banking services. Fear of security breaches could limit the growth of our online services. We offer various Internet-based services to our clients, including online banking services. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is essential to maintain our clients’ confidence in our online services. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect client transaction data. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to prevent security breaches and periodically test our security, failure to mitigate breaches of security could adversely affect our ability to offer and grow our online services and could harm our business. 25 People generally are concerned with security and privacy on the Internet and any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth of the Internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions. Our ability to provide financial services over the Internet would be severely impeded if clients became unwilling to transmit confidential information online. As a result, our operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our directors and executive officers beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock. As of February 28, 2006, our directors and executive officers together with their affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 42% of our outstanding voting common stock (not including vested option shares). As a result, such shareholders would most likely control the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. We can provide no assurance that the investment objectives of such shareholders will be the same as our other shareholders. The market for our common stock is limited, and potentially subject to volatile changes in price. The market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuation in response to numerous factors, including variations in our annual or quarterly financial results or those of our competitors, changes by financial research analysts in their evaluation of our financial results or those of our competitors, or our failure or that of our competitors to meet such estimates, conditions in the economy in general or the banking industry in particular, or unfavorable publicity affecting us or the banking industry. In addition, the equity markets have, on occasion, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies’ securities and have been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. In addition, the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder’s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Further, the registration of any significant amount of additional shares of our common stock will have the immediate effect of increasing the public float of our common stock and any such increase may cause the market price of our common stock to decline or fluctuate significantly. Any such fluctuations may adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock. Additional shares of our common stock issued in the future could have a dilutive effect. Shares of our common stock eligible for future issuance and sale could have a dilutive effect on the market for our stock. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 80,000,000 shares of common stock. As of February 28, 2006, there were approximately 28,737,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, plus an additional 860,070 shares of our authorized common stock available for the future grant of options and an additional 704,552 shares of common stock reserved for issuance to the holders of stock options previously granted and still outstanding under the Wilshire State Bank 1997 Stock Option Plan. Thus, approximately 49,697,978 shares of our common stock remain authorized (not reserved for stock options or available for future issuance and sale) at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Shares of our preferred stock issued in the future could have dilutive and other effects. Shares of our preferred stock eligible for future issuance and sale could have a dilutive effect on the market for the shares of our common stock. In addition to 80,000,000 shares of common stock, our Articles of Incorporation of the Company authorize the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Although our Board of Directors has no present intent to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock, such shares could be authorized in the future. If such shares of preferred stock are made convertible into shares of common stock, there could be a dilutive effect on the shares of common stock then outstanding. In addition, shares of preferred stock may be provided a preference over holders of common stock upon our liquidation or with respect to the payment of dividends, in respect of voting rights or in the redemption of our capital stock. The rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions applicable to any series of preferred stock would be determined by resolution of our Board of Directors. We face substantial competition in our primary market area. We conduct our banking operations primarily in Southern California. Increased competition in our market may result in reduced loans and deposits. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Many competitors offer the same banking services that we offer in our service area. These competitors include national banks, regional banks and other community banks. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including without limitation, savings and loan institutions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. In particular, our competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger customers. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain deposits, and range and quality of products and services provided, including new technology-driven products and services. Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. We also face competition from out-of-state financial intermediaries that have opened low-end production offices or that solicit deposits in our market areas. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to continue our loan growth and level of deposits and our results of operations and financial condition may otherwise be adversely affected. 26 The profitability of Wilshire Bancorp will be dependent on the profitability of the Bank. Wilshire Bancorp was incorporated on December 9, 2003, for the purpose of facilitating the issuance of trust preferred securities for the Bank and becoming the Bank's holding company. Therefore, Wilshire Bancorp has limited operating history, and since its principal activity for the foreseeable future will be to act as the holding company of the Bank, the profitability of Wilshire Bancorp will be dependent on the profitability of the Bank. The Bank operates in an extremely competitive banking environment, competing with a number of banks and other financial institutions which possess greater financial resources than those available to the Bank, in addition to other independent banks. In addition, the banking business is affected by general economic and political conditions, both domestic and international, and by government monetary and fiscal policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, high interest rates, short money supply, scarce natural resources, international terrorism and other disorders as well as other factors beyond the control of the Bank may adversely affect its profitability. Banks are also subject to extensive governmental supervision, regulation and control, and future legislation and government policy could adversely affect the banking industry and the operations of the Bank. Wilshire Bancorp relies heavily on the payment of dividends from the Bank. The ability of Wilshire Bancorp to meet its debt service requirements and to pay dividends depends on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to Wilshire Bancorp on the Bank’s common stock, as Wilshire Bancorp has no other source of significant income. However, the Bank is subject to regulations limiting the amount of dividends the Bank may pay to Wilshire Bancorp. For example, the payment of dividends by the Bank is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to the capital adequacy guidelines issued by the FDIC. All banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, at least one-half of which must be in the form of Tier 1 capital, and a ratio of Tier 1 capital to average adjusted assets of 4.0%. If (i) the FDIC increases any of these required ratios; (ii) the total of risk-weighted assets of the Bank increases significantly; and/or (iii) the Bank's income decreases significantly, the Bank's Board of Directors may decide or be required to retain a greater portion of the Bank's earnings to achieve and maintain the required capital or asset ratios. This will reduce the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends by the Bank to Wilshire Bancorp. Further, in some cases, the FDIC could take the position that it has the power to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends if, in its view, such payments would constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices. In addition, whether dividends are paid and their frequency and amount will depend on the financial condition and performance, and the discretion of management of the Bank. The foregoing restrictions on dividends paid by the Bank may limit Wilshire Bancorp’s ability to obtain funds from such dividends for its cash needs, including funds for payment of its debt service requirements and operating expenses and for payment of cash dividends to Wilshire Bancorp’s shareholders. The amount of dividends the Bank could pay to Wilshire Bancorp as of December 31, 2005 without prior regulatory approval, which is limited by statute to the sum of undivided profits for the current year plus net profits for the preceding two years, was $61.6 million. 27 Anti-takeover provisions of our charter documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management. Certain provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws could discourage unsolicited takeover proposals not approved by the Board of Directors in which shareholders could receive a premium for their shares, thereby potentially limiting the opportunity for our shareholders to dispose of their shares at the higher price generally available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal or may have the effect of permitting our current management, including the current Board of Directors, to retain its position, and place it in a better position to resist changes that shareholders may wish to make if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of our business. The anti-takeover measures included in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, include, without limitation, the following: • the elimination of cumulative voting, • the adoption of a classified board of directors, • super-majority shareholder voting requirements to modify certain provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and • restrictions on certain "business combinations" with third parties who may acquire our securities outside of an action taken by us. We are subject to significant government regulation and legislation that increases the cost of doing business and inhibits our ability to compete. We are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation, all of which is subject to material change from time to time. These laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and have an adverse impact on our ability to compete efficiently with other financial service providers that are not similarly regulated. Changes in regulatory policies or procedures could result in management’s determining that a higher provision for loan losses would be necessary and could cause higher loan charge-offs, thus adversely affecting our net earnings. There can be no assurance that future regulation or legislation will not impose additional requirements and restrictions on us in a manner that could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and prospects. We could be negatively impacted by downturns in the South Korean economy. Many of our customers are locally based Korean-Americans who also conduct business in South Korea. Although we conduct most of our business with locally-based customers and rely on domestically located assets to collateralize our loans and credit arrangements, we have historically had some exposure to the economy of South Korea in connection with certain of our loans and credit transactions with Korean banks. Such exposure has consisted of: • discounts of acceptances created by banks in South Korea, • advances made against clean documents presented under sight letters of credit issued by banks in South Korea, • advances made against clean documents held for later presentation under letters of credit issued by banks in South Korea, and • extensions of credit to borrowers in the U.S. secured by letters of credit issued by banks in South Korea. We generally enter into any such loan or credit arrangements, in excess of $200,000 and of longer than 120 days, only with the largest of the Korean banks and spread other lesser or shorter term loan or credit arrangements among a variety of medium-sized Korean banks. Due to the economic crisis in South Korea in the mid-1990's, management has continued to closely monitor our exposure to the Korean economy and the activities of Korean banks with which we conduct business. To date, we have not experienced any significant losses attributable to our exposure to South Korea. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that our efforts to minimize exposure to downturns in the Korean economy will be successful in the future, and another significant downturn in the Korean economy could result in significant credit losses for us. 28 In addition, because our customer base is largely Korean-American, our deposit base could significantly decrease as a result of a deterioration of the Korean economy. For example, some of our customers' businesses may rely on funds from South Korea. Further, our customers may temporarily withdraw deposits in order to transfer funds and benefit from gains on foreign exchange and interest rates, and/or to help their relatives in South Korea during downturns in the Korean economy. A significant decrease in our deposits could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Item
