Item 1A Risk Factors - --------------------- An investment in the Company's common stock involves a degree of risk. These risks should be considered carefully with the uncertainties described below, and all other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase the Company's common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial may also become important factors that may harm the Company's business, financial condition or results or operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm the Company's business, 19 financial condition and results of operations. The trading price of the Company's common stock could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties, and you may lose part or all of your investment. Certain statements in this report contain forward-looking information. In general, forward-looking statements include estimates of future revenues, cash flows, capital expenditures, or other financial items and assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations regarding future events and use words such as "anticipate", "believe", "expect", "may", "will" and other similar terminology. These statements speak only as of the date they were made and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Several factors, many beyond the Company's control, could cause actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. Planned Expansion May Not Be Successful - --------------------------------------- The Company, as general partner of two limited partnerships, has submitted its building plans to the appropriate governmental agencies for building permits to build two (2) new restaurants in its existing South Florida market and expects, at a minimum, to open these two (2) new restaurants in fiscal year 2007. The Company's ability to open and profitably operate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations, the availability of limited partner investors, the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors, the availability of construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets, variations in labor and building material costs, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount of time. If the Company is unable to unsuccessfully manage these risks, it could face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues and earnings in future periods. General Economic Factors May Adversely Affect Results of Operations - ------------------------------------------------------------------- National, regional and local economic conditions, such as recessionary economic cycles, a protracted economic slowdown or a worsening economy, could adversely affect disposable consumer income and consumer confidence. Unfavorable changes in these factors or in other business and economic condition affecting the Company's customers could reduce customer traffic in some or all of the Company's restaurants and/or package liquor stores, impose practical limits on pricing and increase costs, any of which could lower profit margins and have a material effect on the Company's results of operations. 20 Changes in Customer Preferences for Casual Dining Styles Could Adversely Affect Financial Performance - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Changing customer preferences, tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact the Company's business and financial performance. The Company offers a large variety of entrees, side dishes and desserts and its continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of its cuisine and casual style of dining. A change from this dining style may have an adverse effect on the Company's business. Labor Shortages, an Increase in Labor Costs, or Inability to Attract Employees Could Harm Company Business - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Company's employees are essential to the operation of the Company restaurants and/or package liquor stores and the Company's ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to its customers. If the Company is unable to attract and retain enough qualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience, the Company's results may be negatively affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require the Company to pay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs. Increases in Employee Minimum Wages by the Federal or State Government Could Adversely Affect Business - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Certain of the Company employees are paid wages that relate to federal and state minimum wage rates. Increases in the minimum wage rates, such as annual cost of living increases in the State of Florida minimum wage, may significantly increase labor costs. In addition, since the Company's business is labor-intensive, shortages in the labor pool or other inflationary pressure could increase labor costs, which could harm the Company's financial performance. Fluctuations in Commodity Prices and Availability of Commodities Including Pork, Beef, Fish, Poultry and Dairy Could Affect Company Business - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A significant component of the Company's costs are related to food commodities including pork, beef, fish, poultry and dairy products. If there is a substantial increase in prices for these products and the Company is unable to offset the increases with changes in menu prices, the Company's results could be negatively affected. 21 Due to the Company's Geographic Locations, Restaurants are Subject to Climate Conditions that Could Affect Operations - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- All but one (1) of the Company restaurants and package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida. During hurricane season, (June 1st through November 30th each year), the Company's restaurants and/or package liquor stores may face harsh weather associated with hurricanes and tropical storms. These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficult for customers to visit the Company's restaurants and package liquor stores, or may necessitate the closure of the same for a period of time. If customers are unable to visit the Company's restaurants and/or package liquor stores, Company sales and operating results may be negatively affected. Due to the Company's Geographic Locations, the Company May Not be Able to Get Windstorm Insurance Coverage or Adequate Windstorm Insurance Coverage at a Reasonable Rate - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Due to the anticipated active hurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, the Company may not be able to get windstorm insurance coverage for its restaurant and package liquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates. If the Company is unable to get windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, then the Company will be self-insured for all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, which may have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition and/or results of operations of the Company. Inability to Attract and Retain Customers Could Affect Results of Operations - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Company takes pride in its ability to attract and retain customers, however, if the Company does not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for its customers, they may not return and results may be negatively affected. The Company Faces Competition in the Restaurant and Liquor Industries, and if the Company is Unable to Compete Effectively, its Business and Financial Performance will be Adversely Affected - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The restaurant and liquor industries are intensely competitive and are affected by changes in customer tastes, dietary habits and by economic and demographic trends. New menu items, concepts and trends are constantly merging. The Company competes on quality, variety, value, service, price and location. If the Company is unable to compete effectively, its business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. 22
