ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS OUR INDEBTEDNESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO GROW AND COMPETE AND PREVENT US FROM FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR NOTES AND OUR OTHER INDEBTEDNESS. As of December 31, 2005, we had $1,311.0 million of debt outstanding, and $350.0 million of availability under our five year revolving credit agreement. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, limit our ability to grow and compete and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our notes and our other indebtedness. A discussion of our debt is contained in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements which are incorporated herein. We consider our principal credit agreements ("PCA's") to be our five-year term loan ($461.2 million outstanding at December 31, 2005) and $350.0 million five-year revolving credit facilities (zero amount outstanding at December 31, 2005). Our PCA's require us to meet financial ratios, including total consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreements) and consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreements) to interest expense. These restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities. Our ability to comply with the covenants as in effect from time to time, will depend on our future operating performance. If we fail to comply with those covenants and terms, we will be in default. In this case, we would be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance. If we were unable to obtain any necessary waivers, the debt under our PCA credit facilities could be accelerated, and become immediately due and payable. In addition, both of our PCA's have a cross default provision whereby amounts outstanding could become due and payable if we default on other debt obligations of at least $25.0 million. WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR DEBT IS DOWNGRADED. Our ability to complete financing of debt securities on satisfactory terms in the future will depend, in part, on the status of our future credit ratings. The current ratings of our senior unsecured long-term indebtedness are BBB- by Standard & Poor's Ratings Service ("S&P") and Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"). Either S&P or Moody's, or both, may downgrade our credit rating at any time, which would make it more difficult to complete financing of debt securities on satisfactory terms and would generally result in increased future borrowing costs and more restrictive covenants and may adversely affect our access to capital. In addition, such a downgrade from current levels would trigger a requirement, under the terms of our PCA's, for specified subsidiaries in the U.S. to guarantee the obligations under our PCA's. WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN COMPLETING THE INTEGRATION OF SURFACE SPECIALTIES AND OPERATING THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN OUR MARKETS. Integrating and operating the acquired businesses, and achieving the full benefit and potential efficiencies from such acquisitions, requires substantial management, financial and other resources and may pose several risks, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. These risks include: o difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel, operations and technologies; o the need to manage a significantly larger business with operations in different locations around the world; o diversion of management's attention from the ongoing development of our existing businesses or other business concerns; o failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business; and o unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. If we experience any of these difficulties our financial performance and ability to compete successfully in any of our markets could be adversely affected. DISPOSITION OR RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT OR ACQUISITION INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT OR ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY UNPREDICTABLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE. Management regularly reviews our business portfolio in terms of strategic fit and financial performance and may from time to time dispose of or withdraw certain product lines. Additionally, management regularly reviews the cost effectiveness of its plant sites and/or asset at such sites. Long-lived assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We may find it necessary to record disposition, restructuring or asset impairment charges in connection with such reviews. For example, we recorded restructuring charges of $14.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they are recorded. Another example is an event such as the notice of termination by DSM of our manufacturing joint venture at the end of its term on August 1, 2007. We are reviewing our go-forward options at the end of the venture, and depending on various factors and assumptions such as market demand and raw material costs it could lead to the recording of an impairment charge related to the recoverability of the AMEL long-lived assets. At December 31, 2005, the carrying value of our 50% share of AMEL's long-lived assets was approximately $l5.0 million. Based on our current plans, the estimated future cash flows are sufficient to support the carrying value of these assets. For further discussion of AMEL, see "Building Block Chemicals Segment, MELAMINE." -13- We test goodwill and indefinite-lived acquisition intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in our fourth fiscal quarter and more often if events occur or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit to an amount below its carrying value. We also test for other possible acquisition intangible impairments if events occur or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of the stated assets. In connection with the acquisition of Surface Specialties, we recorded goodwill in the amount of $728.3 million and recorded acquisition intangibles of $490.4 million at December 31, 2005. In total, we had $1,012.2 million of goodwill, and acquisition intangibles with a net carrying value of $491.5 million at December 31, 2005. Future events could cause the impairment of goodwill or acquisition intangibles associated with the Surface Specialties business or any other of our reporting units. Any resulting impairment loss would be a non-cash charge and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in any future period in which we record a charge. PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS. See "Item 1. BUSINESS - Customers and Suppliers." WE FACE ACTIVE COMPETITION FROM OTHER COMPANIES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. See "Item 1. BUSINESS - Competition." WE FACE NUMEROUS RISKS RELATING TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. See "Item 1. BUSINESS - International." OUR PRODUCTION FACILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO OPERATING RISKS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS. See "Item 1. BUSINESS - Operating Risks." WE ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL AND PRODUCT REGULATORY EXPENSES AND RISKS. See "Item 1. BUSINESS - Environmental Matters." SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS' BUSINESSES ARE CYCLICAL AND DEMAND BY OUR CUSTOMERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS WEAKENS DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. LOSS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. See "Item 1. BUSINESS - Customers and Suppliers." WE ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION EXPENSE AND RISK. See "Item 1. LEGAL PROCEDINGS." ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. -14-
