Item 1A. Risk Factors Anheuser-Busch makes forward-looking statements in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in other oral or written communications. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to be materially different from those indicated (both favorably and unfavorably). These risks and uncertainties include (but are not limited to) the risks described below. Anheuser-Busch undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Increased competitive pressures may reduce revenues or increase costs. Anheuser-Busch faces competition in each business from alternative providers of the products we offer. For example: The domestic beer business competes with other domestic and international brewers as well as with producers of other types of alcohol beverages; The international beer business competes with a mix of national, regional, local and international brewers, depending on the country; The packaging business competes with other producers of beverage cans and beverage lids as well as producers of other types of beverage containers; The family entertainment business competes with the operators of other theme and amusement parks, public zoos, public parks and other family events and attractions. 9Table of Contents Competition may divert consumers and customers from the Anheuser-Busch products. In order to respond to competition, Anheuser-Busch may need to change the prices of products or incur additional costs to introduce new packages or products. Innovation faces inherent risks, and the new products we introduce may not be successful. Changes in consumer tastes and preferences could reduce demand for the Anheuser-Busch products. The success of Anheuser-Busch depends on satisfying consumer tastes and preferences with our beverage products, our container products and our theme park offerings. Consumer preferences can change in unpredictable ways, and consumers may begin to prefer the products of competitors. In order to respond to changes in consumer preferences, Anheuser-Busch may need to increase and enhance the marketing of existing products, change the pricing of existing products or introduce new products and services. Each response might affect financial results. Increases in raw material and commodity prices could increase operating costs. The Anheuser-Busch malt beverage products require various agricultural products. Anheuser-Busch also uses aluminum cansheet to manufacture beverage cans and lids, glass bottles as containers for malt beverages and natural gas, fuel oil and coal as primary fuel materials. Raw materials and commodities are subject to price volatility caused by market fluctuations, including the quality and availability of supply, weather, currency fluctuations, trade agreements among producing and consuming nations, consumer demand and changes in governmental programs. To some extent, derivative financial instruments and supply agreements can protect against increases in materials and commodities costs, but they do not provide complete protection over the longer term. Anheuser-Busch might be able to raise prices to offset increases in costs, but price increases can reduce sales volumes. If Anheuser-Busch is not able to increase prices to offset co st increases or if price increases reduce sales volumes, financial results would be adversely affected. Anheuser-Busch is subject to risks associated with international operations. Anheuser-Busch has significant international operations and the profitable expansion of the international business is a long term goal. Anheuser-Busch has equity investments in brewers in China and Mexico, owns breweries in China and the United Kingdom and sells malt beverages globally. Although Anheuser-Busch does not significantly compete in the Mexican beer market, a significant change in Modelos business could have a material effect on the Companys reported net income and earnings per share. The international operations are subject to the inherent risks of international business, such as: Political and economic changes; Changes in the relations between the United States and foreign countries; Actions of foreign or United States governmental authority affecting trade and foreign investment; Regulations on repatriation of funds; Foreign currency exchange restrictions; Interpretation and application of local laws and regulations; Enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights; Local labor conditions and regulations. The loss of key personnel could adversely affect operations and financial results. The ability of Anheuser-Busch to meet strategic and financial goals will depend to a significant extent on the continued contributions of the senior management team. Future success will also depend in large part on the ability to identify, attract and retain other highly qualified managerial, sales and marketing and technical personnel. Anheuser-Busch may not succeed in retaining senior management or other key personnel. The loss 10Table of Contentsof senior management or other key personnel or the inability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could make it difficult to manage the business and could adversely affect operations and financial results. An increase in beer excise taxes or other taxes could adversely affect financial results. Anheuser-Busch is affected by federal, foreign, state and local income and other taxes, particularly beer excise taxes which are levied both by the federal, foreign and state governments. Proposals are made from time to time to increase beer excise taxes in a variety of states. In addition, Anheuser-Busch is subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service and other foreign, state and local taxing authorities. An increase in taxes or an adverse determination by a taxing authority could adversely affect financial results. Governmental regulation could affect our operations or increase costs. All of the Anheuser-Busch businesses are subject to governmental regulation. The Anheuser-Busch domestic beer business and its wholesalers are especially subject to extensive regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Permits, licenses and approvals necessary to the domestic beer business are required from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the United States Treasury Department, state alcohol beverage regulatory agencies in the states in which we sell or produce products and local authorities in some jurisdictions in which we sell products. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly. Anheuser-Busch may be subject to claims that we have not complied with existing laws and regulations, which could result in fines and penalties. Anheuser-Busch is routinely subject to new or modified laws and regulations with which we must comply in order to avoid fines and other penalties and which may affect operations. From time to time, new laws and regulations are proposed that would affect operations, affect the distribution of the Anheuser-Busch products by its wholesalers, or increase expenses. Anheuser-Busch is subject to litigation directed at the alcohol beverage industry and other litigation. Anheuser-Busch and many other brewers and distilled spirits manufacturers have been sued in several courts regarding advertising practices and underage consumption. The suits allege that the defendants marketed products to underage consumers. The suits purport to be class actions and seek unspecified money damages and equitable remedies. We believe we have meritorious defenses and will defend ourselves vigorously in these actions. Anheuser-Busch is now, and may in the future be, a party to other legal proceedings and claims, and significant damages may be asserted against us. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, it is possible that Anheuser-Busch might incur liabilities as a consequence of the proceedings and claims. Anheuser-Busch may make acquisitions, investments and joint venture arrangements, which are risky. Anheuser-Busch has in the past and may in the future make acquisitions of, investments in, and joint venture arrangements with international brewers to increase international beer profits. We cannot be assured that the acquisitions, investments and joint venture arrangements will achieve the expected benefits. Also, our ability to increase international beer profits by this method will depend on the availability of suitable candidates at an acceptable price and our ability to compete effectively for these candidates. The Anheuser-Busch businesses are subject to a number of other miscellaneous risks that may adversely affect financial results. Other miscellaneous risks include: Changes in global and domestic economies, including slow growth rate, rise in interest rates, changes in currency exchange rates, rise in cost of commodities, inflation, unemployment and weakening consumer confidence which could reduce demand for the Anheuser-Busch products, affect the businesses of the international brewers in which we have made investments or increase costs, including borrowing costs; 11Table of Contents Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, which may result in shortages of raw materials and commodities and reduction in tourism and attendance at the Anheuser-Busch theme parks; Unusual weather conditions which could affect domestic beer consumption, attendance at the Anheuser-Busch theme parks, raw material availability, or natural gas prices; Continued threat of terrorist acts and war, which may result in heightened security and higher costs for imports and exports, reduced tourism and attendance at the Anheuser-Busch theme parks and contraction of the United States and worldwide economies; Changes in the Anheuser-Busch share price which could affect the share repurchase program.
