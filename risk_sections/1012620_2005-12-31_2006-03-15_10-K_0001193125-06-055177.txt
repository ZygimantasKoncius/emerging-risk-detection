Item 1A. Risk Factors Our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks that could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed or forecast in our forward-looking statements, including the risks described below and the risks identified in other documents which are filed or furnished with the SEC. GENERAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS If we are unable to consummate additional acquisitions or investments, we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy. Our growth strategy is based on the selective acquisition, development and investment in rail properties, both in new regions and in regions in which we currently operate. The success of this strategy will depend on, among other things: n the availability of suitable opportunities; n the level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources; n our ability to value acquisition and investment candidates accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for those acquisitions and investments; n our ability to identify and enter into mutually beneficial relationships with venture partners; and n the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the new businesses. If we are not successful in implementing our growth strategy, the market price for our Class A Common Stock may be adversely affected. Our inability to integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits could have adverse consequences to our business. We have experienced significant growth through acquisitions and we expect to continue to grow through additional acquisitions. Acquisitions generally result in increased operating and administrative costs and, to the extent financed with debt, additional interest costs. We may not be able to manage or integrate the acquired companies or businesses successfully. The process of combining acquired businesses may be disruptive to our business and may cause an interruption or reduction of our business as a result of the following factors, among others: n loss of key employees or customers; n possible inconsistencies in or conflicts between standards, controls, procedures and policies among the combined companies and the need to implement company-wide financial, accounting, information technology and other systems; n failure to maintain the quality of services that have historically been provided; 14 Genesee & Wyoming Inc. 2005 FORM 10K n failure to integrate employees of rail lines acquired from Class I railroads, governments or other entities into the our regional railroad culture; n failure to coordinate geographically diverse organizations; and n the diversion of managements attention from our day-to-day business as a result of the need to manage any disruptions and difficulties and the need to add management resources to do so. These disruptions and difficulties, if they occur, may cause us to fail to realize the cost savings, revenue enhancements and other benefits that we expect to result from integrating acquired companies, and may cause material adverse short- and long-term effects on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Even if we are able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations, we may not realize the full benefits of the cost savings, revenue enhancements or other benefits that we may have expected at the time of acquisition. The expected revenue enhancements and cost savings are based on analyses completed by members of our management. These analyses necessarily involve assumptions as to future events, including general business and industry conditions, the longevity of specific customer plants and factories served, operating costs and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control and may not materialize. While we believe these analyses and their underlying assumptions to be reasonable, they are estimates which are necessarily speculative in nature. In addition, even if we achieve the expected benefits, we may not be able to achieve them within the anticipated time frame. Also, the cost savings and other synergies from these acquisitions may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the companies, increases in other expenses, operating losses or problems in the business unrelated to these acquisitions. Most of our recent and material acquisitions have involved the purchase of stock of existing companies. These acquisitions, as well as acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of a company may expose us to liability for actions by an acquired business and its management before the acquisition. The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition, and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies, may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities. For our two most recently completed material acquisitions, the GP Railroads and Rail Partners acquisition, other than certain representations related to fundamental matters, such as ownership of capital stock, most of the representations made by the sellers have expired in the case of GP or will expire on or before June 2008 in the case of Rail Partners. A material liability associated with an acquisition, especially where there is no right to indemnification, could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. We may need additional capital to fund our acquisitions. If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may be required to forego potential acquisitions, which would impair the execution of our growth strategy. Since 1996, we have acquired interests in 40 railroads, the majority of which were for cash. As of December 31, 2005, we had undrawn revolver capacity of approximately $135 million available for acquisitions or other activities. We intend to continue to review acquisition candidates and potential purchases of railroad assets, and to attempt to acquire companies and assets that meet our investment criteria. We expect that, as in the past, we will pay cash for some or the entire purchase price of any acquisitions or purchases that we make. Depending on the number of acquisitions or purchases and the prices of the acquisitions, we may not generate enough cash from operations to pay for the acquisitions or purchases. We may, therefore, need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our acquisitions. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions and costs on our operations. Additional capital, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may be required to forego potential acquisitions, which could impair the execution of our growth strategy. Because we depend on Class I railroads and other connecting carriers for our North American operations, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with these carriers deteriorate. The railroad industry in the U.S. and Canada is dominated by seven Class I carriers that have substantial market control and negotiating leverage. In 2005, more than 85% of our total carloads in North America were interchanged with Class I carriers. A decision by any of these Class I carriers to use alternate modes of transportation, such as motor carriers or cease certain freight movements, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. The quantitative impact of such a decision would depend on which Class I carrier made such a decision and which of our routes were affected. Our ability to provide rail service to customers in the U.S. and Canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to, among other matters, freight rates, revenue divisions, car supply, reciprocal switching, interchange and trackage rights. Deterioration in the operations of, or service provided by, those connecting carriers, or in our relationship with those connecting carriers, would adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. 2005 FORM 10K Genesee & Wyoming Inc. 15 Class I carriers also have traditionally been significant sources of business for us, as well as sources of potential acquisition candidates as they divest branch lines to smaller rail operators. We lease several railroads from Class I carriers under long term lease arrangements, which collectively accounted for approximately 13% of our 2005 revenues. In addition, we own several railroads that also lease portions of the track or right of way upon which they operate from Class I railroads. Failure of our railroads to comply with the terms of these leases and agreements in all material respects could result in the loss of operating rights with respect to those rail properties, which would adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Because we depend on Class I carriers for our U.S. and Canadian operations, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with those carriers deteriorate. Approximately 63% of our Mexican revenues originate and terminate on FCCMs railroad and FCCM is dependent on its relationship with Ferrosur S.A. de C.V. (Ferrosur), the connecting carrier, for the remainder of its revenues. To the extent that we experience service or other commercial disruptions with Ferrosur, our ability to serve existing customers and expand our business will suffer. In November 2005 Grupo Mexico, the majority owner of Ferrocarril Mexicano S.A. de C.V. (Ferromex), which is one of the largest railroads in Mexico and principally operates in the north and western parts of Mexico, announced that it intended to acquire Ferrosur. The transaction is subject to review by the Mexican Commission on Competition, which rejected a similar transaction in 2002. In addition, Kansas City Southern de Mexico, which operates between Ferromex and Ferrosur and in the north eastern part of Mexico, has commenced legal proceedings to prevent the transaction from closing. We are still evaluating the potential commercial impact of this transaction on FCCM, which may result in increased costs to FCCM or limitations on FCCMs ability to access traffic originating or terminating on KCS-Mexicos network. Our North American operations are dependent on our ability to obtain railcars and locomotives from other providers. Much of the freight transported by our U.S. and Canadian railroads moves on railcars supplied by other independent providers pursuant to short-term arrangements. In 2005, approximately 88% of our railcars were leased. If the number of railcars supplied by such other rail providers is insufficient, or if the cost of obtaining these railcars increases, we might not be able to obtain replacement railcars on favorable terms or at all and shippers may seek alternate forms of transportation. In addition, in some cases we use third-party locomotives to provide transportation services to our customers. Without these third-party locomotives, we would need to invest additional capital in locomotives. We face competition from numerous sources, including those relating to geography, substitute products, other types of transportation and other rail operators. Each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers. Our railroads, however, compete directly with other modes of transportation, principally motor carriers and, on some routes, ship, barge and pipeline operators. Transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities while we must build and maintain our network. If the scope and quality of these alternative methods of transportation are materially increased, or if legislation is passed providing materially greater opportunity for motor carriers with respect to size or weight restrictions, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. We are also subject to geographic and product competition. For example, a customer could shift production to a region where we do not have operations or could substitute one commodity for another commodity that is not transported by rail. In either case, we would lose a source of revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. The extent of this competition varies significantly among our railroads. Competition is based primarily upon the rate charged, the relative costs of substitutable products and the transit time required. In addition, competition is based on the quality and reliability of the service provided. Because approximately 86% of our carloads involve interchange with another carrier, we have only limited control over the total price, transit time or quality of such service. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality of these alternative modes of transportation in the locations in which we operate, or legislation granting materially greater latitude for other modes of transportation, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. It is difficult to quantify the potential impact of competition on our business, since not only each customer, but also each customer location and each product shipped from such location is subject to different types of competition. We are subject to significant governmental regulation of our railroad operations. The failure to comply with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. We are subject to governmental regulation in the U.S. by a significant number of federal, state and local regulatory authorities, including the STB, the FRA and state departments of transportation, with respect to our rail - - 16 Genesee & Wyoming Inc. 2005 FORM 10K road operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and other matters. We are also subject to regulatory authorities in the other countries in which we operate. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, governments may change the regulatory framework within which we operate without providing us with any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on our operating results, financial condition or liquidity. Also, some of the regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses, permits and other authorizations, and we may not continue to be able to do so. We could incur significant costs for violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations. Our railroad operations and real estate ownership are subject to extensive foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to waters, and the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases. We may incur environmental liability from conditions or practices at properties previously owned or operated by us, properties leased by us, and other properties owned by third parties (for example, properties at which hazardous substances or wastes for which we are responsible have been treated, stored, spilled or disposed), as well as at properties currently owned by us. Under some environmental statutes, such liability may be without regard to whether we were at fault, and may also be joint and several, whereby we are responsible for all the liability at issue even though we (or the entity that gives rise to our liability) may be only one of a number of entities whose conduct contributed to the liability. Environmental liabilities may arise from claims asserted by owners or occupants of affected properties or other third parties affected by environmental conditions (for example, contractors and current or former employees) seeking to recover in connection with alleged damages to their property or with personal injury or death, as well as by governmental authorities seeking to remedy environmental conditions or to enforce environmental obligations. Environmental requirements and liabilities could obligate us to incur significant costs, including significant expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Some of our employees belong to labor unions, and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. We are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the United States, Mexico, Australia, Canada and Bolivia. In North America, we are party to 35 contracts with national labor organizations. We are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to seven of those agreements. We have also entered into employee bargaining agreements with an additional 70 employees who represent themselves. In each of Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales, ARG has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of employees. Our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers. If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs, which in either case could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. We are also subject to the risk of the unionization of our non-unionized employees which could result in higher employee compensation and restrictive working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility. In addition, work interruptions may be threatened which could cause customers to seek other transportation alternatives, with a corresponding adverse financial impact. If we are unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled workers, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected. We believe that our success depends upon our ability to employ and retain skilled workers that possess the ability to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities. The operation and maintenance of our equipment and facilities involve complex and specialized processes and often must be performed in harsh conditions, often resulting in a high employee turnover rate when compared to many other industries. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers. Since 2003, our revenue has increased 57.4%. Over the same period, our annual average number of North American employees has increased 24% from 1,819 for 2003 to 2,260 for 2005. Within the next seven years, we estimate approximately 12% of the current workforce will become eligible for retirement. Approximately two-thirds of these workers hold key operating positions, such as conductors, engineers, and mechanics. In addition, the demand for workers with these types of skills has increased, especially from Class I railroads, which can usually offer higher wages and better benefits. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force or an increase in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. If either of these events were to occur, our cost structure could increase, our margins could decrease and our growth potential could be impaired, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and 2005 FORM 10K Genesee & Wyoming Inc. 17 liquidity. For example, a $1.00 per hour increase in wage rates for the average number of U.S. hourly employees during 2005 principally involved in operating activities would have increased annual labor expenses by approximately $3.2 million. The occurrence of losses or other liabilities which are not covered by insurance or which exceed our insurance limits could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. We have obtained for each of our railroads insurance coverage for losses arising from personal injury and for property damage in the event of derailments or other accidents or occurrences. Unexpected or catastrophic circumstances such as accidents involving passenger trains or spillage of hazardous materials could cause our liability to exceed our insurance limits. Insurance is available from only a very limited number of insurers and we may not be able to obtain insurance protection at our current levels or obtain it on terms acceptable to us. In addition, subsequent adverse events directly and indirectly applicable to us may result in additional increases in our insurance premiums and/or our self insured retentions and could result in limitations to the coverage under our existing policies. The occurrence of losses or other liabilities which are not covered by insurance or which exceed our insurance limits could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Rising fuel costs could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses. Fuel costs for fuel used in operations were approximately 12.2% and 10.0% of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Fuel costs for fuel used in operations were approximately 11.8% and 10.0% of ARGs operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Fuel prices and supplies are influenced significantly by factors beyond our and ARGs control, such as international political and economic circumstances. In the United States and Canada, through certain of our contractual relationships with certain Class I railroads, we are partially compensated for increases in fuel costs through fuel surcharges. For instance, for the year ended December 31, 2005, average fuel prices increased by approximately 36.4%. Through the use of fuel surcharges in the U.S., we were able to pass through approximately 73% of this increase, excluding fuel surcharges associated with acquisitions. If Class I railroads change their policies regarding fuel surcharges, if diesel fuel prices increase dramatically or if a fuel supply shortage were to arise from production curtailments, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, these events could have a material adverse effect on our and ARGs operating results, financial condition and liquidity. The loss of important customers or contracts may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. In North America, the freight revenue from our ten largest North American freight revenue customers accounted for approximately 24%, 27% and 27% of our operating revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2005 and 2004, our largest North American freight revenue customer was a company in the paper and forest products industry, freight revenue from which accounted for approximately 8% of our North American revenues in these years. In 2003, our largest North American freight revenue customer was a coal-fired electricity generating plant, freight revenue from which accounted for approximately 5% of our North American revenues. ARGs ten largest customers accounted for approximately 72%, 74% and 70% of its operating revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, ARGs largest customer was AWB, which accounted for approximately 17%, 25% and 20% respectively, of ARGs operating revenues. The loss of one or more of our or ARGs largest customers or the loss or material modification of one or more key contracts with such customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Our results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy. In any given year, we, like other railroads, are susceptible to changes in the economic conditions of the industries and geographic areas that produce and consume the freight we transport. In addition, many of the goods and commodities carried by us experience cyclicality in their demand. Our results of operations can be expected to reflect this cyclicality because of the significant fixed costs inherent in railroad operations. Should an economic slowdown or recession occur in North America or in the other countries in which we operate, the volume of rail shipments carried by us is likely to be affected. Our results of operations are susceptible to severe weather conditions and other natural occurrences. We are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, including floods, fires, hurricanes, droughts, earthquakes and other natural occurrences. For example: n Mexicos revenues were reduced in 2005 as a result of the impact of Hurricane Stan; 18 Genesee & Wyoming Inc. 2005 FORM 10K n ARGs revenues may be reduced as a result of droughts (drought conditions during the 2002 growing season resulted in a significant reduction in ARGs grain shipments in 2003) or as a result of flash floods, which could damage our tracks and impact our operations; n Our minerals and stone revenues, which include salt, may be reduced by snow-free and ice-free winters in the Northeastern United States, which lessens demand for road salt. Bad weather and natural disasters, such as blizzards in eastern Canada and the Northeastern United States and hurricanes in Mexico and the Southeastern United States could cause a shutdown or substantial disruption of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, even if a material adverse weather or other condition does not directly affect our operations, it can impact the operations of our customers or connecting carriers. Such weather conditions could cause our customers or connecting carriers to reduce or suspend their operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results, financial conditions and liquidity. Furthermore, our expenses could be adversely impacted by weather, including, for example, higher track maintenance and overtime costs in the winter in our New York-Pennsylvania and Canada Regions or possible track repairs related to washouts in Mexico during the rainy season. The development of some of our business could be hindered if we fail to maintain satisfactory working relationships with our joint venture partners or other investors. We conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we own a significant, but less than a controlling, ownership interest. In particular, we own a 50% interest in ARG and a 22.89% interest in our Bolivian operations. In these operations, we do not have control over the operations of the venture. The particular corporate governance provisions affecting our interests vary from venture to venture, but in general, we must obtain the cooperation of other investors in the venture in order to implement and expand upon our business strategies. Any failure to maintain satisfactory working relationships with these other investors or the need to expend significant management resources and time to align our interests with the interests of these partners could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Certain of our capital projects and foreign operations may be impacted by our relationships with government entities. Certain of our existing capital projects are, and certain of our future capital projects may be, at least partially dependent on our ability to obtain government funding. Within the United States, during 2005, we previously obtained funds for seven separate projects, which were funded by federal, state and municipal agencies. These funds represented 11.6% of our capital expenditures in the United States. Government funding for our projects is limited, and there is no guarantee that budget pressure at the federal, state and local level or changing governmental priorities will not eliminate future funding availability. In addition, competition for government funding from other short line railroads, Class I railroads, infrastructure and other companies is significant and the receipt of government funds is often contingent on the acceptance of contractual obligations that may not be strictly profit maximizing. In certain jurisdictions, the acceptance of government funds may impose additional legal obligations on our operations, such as compliance with prevailing wage requirements. Our credit facilities contain numerous covenants that impose certain restrictions on the way we operate our business. Our credit facilities contain covenants imposing restrictions on our ability to, among other things: n incur additional debt; n create liens on our assets; n make certain types of investments; n repurchase shares or pay dividends; n make expenditures for capital projects; n merge or consolidate with others; n effect non-ordinary course asset acquisitions; n dispose of assets or use asset sale proceeds; n enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and n enter into transaction with affiliates; Our credit facilities also contain financial covenants that require us to meet a number of financial ratios and tests. Our failure to comply with the obligations in our credit facilities could result in events of default under the credit facilities, which, if not cured or waived, could permit acceleration of our indebtedness, allowing our senior lenders to foreclose on our assets. 2005 FORM 10K Genesee & Wyoming Inc. 19 Acts of terrorism or anti-terrorism measures may adversely affect us. Our rail lines, port operations and other facilities and equipment, including rail cars carrying hazardous materials, which we are required to transport under federal law, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks. Any terrorist attack or other similar event could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity. In addition, regulatory measures designed to control terrorism could impose substantial costs upon us and could result in impairment to our service, which could also adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity. ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS General We are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries. Some of our significant subsidiaries transact business in foreign countries, namely in Canada and Mexico, and we have equity investments in Australia and Bolivia. In addition, we may consider acquisitions or other investments in other foreign countries in the future. The risks of doing business in foreign countries include: n adverse renegotiation or modification of existing agreements or arrangements with governmental authorities, n adverse changes or greater volatility in the economies of those countries, n adverse effects of currency exchange controls, n adverse currency movements that make goods produced in those countries which are destined for export markets less competitive, n adverse changes to the regulatory environment of those countries, n adverse changes to the tax laws and regulations of those countries, n restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings, n the nationalization of the businesses that we operate, n the actual or perceived failure by us to fulfill commitments under concession agreements, n the potential instability of foreign governments, including from domestic insurgency, and n the challenge of managing a culturally and geographically diverse operation. Because some of our significant subsidiaries and affiliates transact business in foreign currencies, and because a significant portion of our net income comes from the operations of our foreign subsidiaries, future exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect us and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods. Our operations in Mexico and Canada accounted for 9.1% and 13.2% of consolidated revenues, respectively, and ARG accounted for 18.9% of consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2005. The results of operations of our foreign operations are reported in the local currency  the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso  and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the U.S. dollar can impact our results. The exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. For instance, in the year ended December 31, 2005, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso appreciated 3.5%, 9.9% and 3.6%, respectively, relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, as a result of U.S. dollar denominated intercompany debt between our Mexican subsidiaries, we are subject to increased non-cash expense when the Mexican peso appreciates. For the year ended December 31, 2005, these non-cash expenses totaled $750,000. The functional currency of our Bolivian operations is the U.S. dollar. We cannot assure that we will be able to effectively manage our exchange rate risks and the volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, because our financial statements are stated in U.S. dollars, such fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods. Failure to meet concession commitments with respect to operations of our rail lines could result in the loss of our investment and a related loss of revenues. We have entered into long-term concession and/or lease agreements with governmental authorities in Mexico, Bolivia, South Australia and Western Australia. These concession and lease agreements are subject to a number of conditions, including those relating to the maintenance of certain standards with respect to safety, service, 20 Genesee & Wyoming Inc. 2005 FORM 10K price and the environment. These concession and lease agreements also typically carry with them a commitment to maintain the condition of the railroad and to make a certain level of capital expenditures. Our failure to meet these commitments under the long-term concession and lease agreements could result in the loss of those concession or lease agreements. The loss of any concession or lease agreement could result in the loss of our entire investment relating to that concession or lease agreement and the related revenues and income. Our operations in Mexico accounted for 9.1% of consolidated revenues, and our interest in ARG and Bolivia accounted for 18.9% and 1.2%, respectively of consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2005. ARG-related Risks Australias open access regime could lead to additional competition for ARGs business and decreased revenues and profit margins. Australias open access regime could lead to additional competition for ARGs business, which could result in decreased revenues and profit margins. The legislative and regulatory framework in Australia allows third party rail operators to gain access to ARGs railway infrastructure, and in turn governs ARGs access to track owned by others. Access charges are paid for access onto the track of other companies, and access charges under state and federal regimes continue to evolve because privatization of railways in Australia is recent. Where ARG pays access fees to others, if those fees were increased, ARGs operating margins could be negatively affected. In addition, if the federal government or respective state regulators were to alter a regulatory regime or determine that access fees charged to current or prospective third party rail freight operators by ARG did not meet competitive standards, then ARGs income from those fees could be negatively affected. When ARG operates over track networks owned by others, including Commonwealth-owned and State-owned networks, the owners of the network rather than the operators are responsible for scheduling the use of the tracks as well as for determining the amount and timing of the expenditures necessary to maintain the network in satisfactory condition. Therefore, in areas where ARG operates over tracks owned by others, it is subject to train scheduling set by the owners as well as the risk that the network will not be adequately maintained. Either risk could affect ARGs operating results, financial condition and liquidity. ARG may be adversely affected by unfavorable conditions in the Australian agricultural industry because a substantial portion of ARGs railroad traffic consists of agricultural commodities. ARG derives a significant portion of its rail freight revenues from shipments of grain. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, grain shipments generated 23.5%, 30.6% and 24.5%, respectively, of ARGs operating revenues. A decrease in grain shipments as a result of adverse weather or other negative agricultural conditions could have a material adverse effect on ARGs operating results, financial condition and liquidity. For example, drought conditions during the 2002 growing season resulted in a significant reduction in ARGs grain shipments in 2003. In addition, ARGs largest freight customer, AWB, is the subject of a government investigation and may lose its exclusive exporter status. If AWB loses its sole exporter status, under certain circumstances, it has the right to re-negotiate the terms of the contracts with ARG, which could affect ARGs operating results, financial condition and liquidity. ARG may be subject to significant additional expenditures in order to comply with Commonwealth and/or state regulations. In addition to the open access requirements described above, other aspects of rail operation are regulated, safety in particular, on both a Commonwealth and a state-by-state basis. ARG has received safety regulatory approval to operate on Commonwealth-owned track, in the Northern Territory and in all mainland states. Changes in safety regulations or other regulations or the imposition of new regulations or conflicts among state and/or Commonwealth regulations could require ARG to make significant expenditures and to incur significant expenses in order to comply with these regulations. Australia Transactions-Related Risks The closing of the Australia Transactions are subject to certain risks. The ARG Sale and our GWA Purchase are subject to customary closing conditions, including certain approvals from the States of Western Australia and South Australia, approval of the Foreign Investment Review Board, approval of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and approvals of the Rail Safety Regulators in Western and South Australia. Accordingly, we cannot predict when these approvals will be obtained, or the timing of the closing of these transactions. In addition, the purchasers in the ARG Sale transaction may not be able to satisfy their obligations to complete the transaction within the deadlines specified in the relevant agreements, although the purchasers would generally forfeit their right to the return of the deposit as a result. Due to these uncertainties, we can offer no assurance that the transactions will be consummated as planned and any delays associated with transactions could impose additional costs upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results and reduce the expected benefits associated with these transactions. Moreover, 2005 FORM 10K Genesee & Wyoming Inc. 21 failure to close the Australia Transactions, under certain circumstances, may lead to an adverse perception of ARG by its employees, customers or suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on ARGs financial condition, operating results and cash flow. Assuming the closing of the Australia Transactions, GWA will be subject to several contractual restrictions on its ability to compete. The regulatory risks applicable to ARG under ARG-related Risks are generally applicable to GWA as well. In addition, as part of the ARG Sale, GWA will be subject to (a) a five-year non-compete in the State of Western Australia, the Melbourne to Adelaide corridor and certain areas within the State of New South Wales currently served by ARG; (b) a right of first refusal for the benefit of Queensland Rail on the sale of (i) GWA or a majority of the ownership of GWA, (ii) a number of high horse-power locomotives and intermodal wagons owned or operated by GWA and (iii) assets of GWAs yard and facilities at Port Augusta; and (c) a restriction on hiring of ARG employees who remain employed by ARG after the closing. These contractual restrictions may place limits on our ability to grow GWAs business, which could have a material adverse effect on GWAs operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
