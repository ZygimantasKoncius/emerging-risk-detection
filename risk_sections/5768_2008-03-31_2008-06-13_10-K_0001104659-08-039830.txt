ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of the following risks occur, the Companys business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of its revenues could harm its business and prospects. The Companys business is dependent on sales to a small number of customers, which include agencies of the United States government. During fiscal 2008, two customers accounted for 22% of the Companys total revenues. During fiscal 2007, two customers accounted for 46% of the Companys total revenues, and during fiscal 2006, two customers accounted for 56% of the Companys total revenues. Certain of the Companys government contracts may be terminated at the governments discretion. The termination of the Companys relationship with one or more of its significant customers or the reduction or delay of orders of its systems by these customers would substantially reduce the Companys revenues, and its business and prospects may be harmed. The Company conducts its business worldwide, which exposes it to a number of difficulties in coordinating its international activities and dealing with multiple regulatory environments. The Companys revenues to international customers, including foreign governments, accounted for approximately 36%, 27% and 14% of its net revenues for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006, respectively, and a significant number of domestic customer orders require shipments to, and services provided in, overseas locations. In addition, the 8 Company transacts business internationally with a number of its key suppliers. As a result of the Companys worldwide business operations, it is subject to various risks, including: · international regulatory requirements and policy changes; · lengthy sales cycles; · longer payment cycles by foreign customers; · difficulties in inventory management, accounts receivable collection and the management of distributors or representatives; · difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; · geopolitical instability; · political and economic changes and disruptions; · favoritism towards local suppliers; · governmental currency controls; · interruption to transportation flow for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; · currency exchange rate fluctuations; and · tariff regulations. Although the Companys international sales have been denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates that increase the relative value of the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult for the Company to compete with foreign manufacturers on price or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its sales and operating results. The Companys lengthy sales cycle requires it to incur significant expenses with no assurance that it will generate revenue or recover such expenses. A substantial portion of the Companys sales depends upon the decision of governmental agencies to upgrade or expand security at border crossing inspection sites, existing airports, seaports and other facilities. Accordingly, a portion of the Companys product sales is subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes that often accompany such capital expenditures. During these approval periods, the Company expends significant financial and managerial resources in anticipation of future orders that may not occur. If the Company fails to receive an order after expending these resources, it may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to recover the costs incurred and its business and prospects may be harmed. The Companys business is dependent upon governmental policies and appropriations. The Companys largest customers are government agencies and demand for its products is dependent upon national priorities and governmental initiatives, including defense-related programs. These priorities and initiatives are subject to change from time to time in response to the economic and political environment. The Company is also exposed to the United States budget approval and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events and macroeconomic conditions, and are beyond our control. While the overall level of U.S. defense spending has increased in recent years for numerous reasons, including increases in funding of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and the U.S. Department of Defenses military transformation initiatives, we can give no assurance that such spending will continue to grow, or not be reduced. Significant changes in defense spending could have long-term consequences for our size and structure. In addition, changes in government priorities and requirements could impact the funding, or the timing of funding, of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for the Companys products or increase its expenses. The Company competes in markets in which the Company or its customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as health and safety regulations. The Company develops, configures and markets its products to meet its customers needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for the Companys products or increase its costs to comply with new regulations, both of which may adversely affect its operating results. 9 The Companys reliance on a limited number of suppliers for some key components for its products could harm its business and prospects. The Company relies on a number of suppliers to provide material and subsystems for our products. The Company is reliant on a number of key international supply partners for core technology products, including subsystems with complex sub-tier supply chains. In addition, certain material or subsystems used in our products may be available from a sole source or limited number of suppliers, increasing the risk of supply disruption. Although our products may be able to be redesigned to avoid using any sole source supplier, it would be expensive and time consuming to make such a change. If the Company changes any of its suppliers, a qualification process would need to be completed and the affected product may require redesign, creating potential delays in product shipments. Some of our suppliers may allocate material due to market demand for the products they produce or market constraints such as the global availability of raw materials. We have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and there can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to meet our requirements. Many of our competitors are much larger and may be able to obtain priority allocations from these shared suppliers, thereby limiting or making our sources of supply unreliable for these components. If our supply of materials is disrupted, we cannot ensure that we would be able to find another supplier on a timely basis. The Company depends on its subcontractors and suppliers to deliver material that is in full compliance with critical quality and specification requirements. Quality issues may affect the reliability and performance of our products, customer confidence, and adversely impact financial performance. Any difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of conforming material could result in delays or reductions in product shipments that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and consolidated results of operations. This in turn could also damage our reputation in the market and cause us to lose market share. The Company does not expect to experience sustained difficulties in securing required material and subsystems to support forward business operations. Fluctuations in the Companys quarterly operating results may cause its stock price to fluctuate. Given the nature of the markets in which the Company participates, it cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability. A high proportion of the Companys costs are fixed, due in part to its significant sales, research and development, and manufacturing costs. As a result of its fixed costs, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect the Companys operating results and stock price in a quarter. Factors that may affect the Companys quarterly operating results and the market price of its common stock include: · demand for and market acceptance of its X-ray inspection systems; · lengthy sales cycles and the effect of large orders; · changes in political agendas or national priorities; · adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which the Company does business; · political unrest in the regions where the Company transacts business; · adverse changes in industries on which the Company is particularly dependent; · competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices for its products; · delays or problems in the introduction of new products; · the Companys competitors announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations; · variations in the Companys product mix; · the timing and amount of the Companys expenditures in anticipation of future sales; · increased costs of raw materials or supplies; and · changes in the volume or timing of product orders. 10 The Company could incur substantial costs as a result of product liability claims and adverse publicity if its X-ray inspection systems fail to detect bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband or other threats to personal safety. If the Companys X-ray inspection systems fail to detect the presence of bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband or other threats to personal safety, the Company could be subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could result in increased costs, reduced sales, and a decline in the market price of the Companys common stock. There are many factors beyond the Companys control that could result in the failure of its products to detect the presence of bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband or other threats to personal safety. Examples of these factors include operator error or misuse of or malfunction of its equipment. The failure of the Companys systems to detect the presence of these dangerous materials may lead to personal injury, loss of life, and extensive property damage and may result in potential claims against the Company. The Companys insurance may be insufficient to protect it from product liability claims. The Companys product liability and umbrella liability insurance may be insufficient to protect it from product liability claims. Moreover, there is a risk that product liability insurance will not continue to be available to the Company at a reasonable cost, if at all. If liability claims exceed the Companys current or available insurance coverage, its business and prospects may be harmed. Regardless of the adequacy of the Companys product liability insurance protection, any significant claim may have an adverse affect on its industry and market reputation, leading to a substantial decrease in demand for its products and reduced revenues. The Company may not be able to fund its research and development activities. The Company generates funds for its research and development activities from operations, private sources and the government. The Company may be unable to generate the funds necessary to support its research and development activities if it does not generate sufficient funds from operations, other potential private sources, or the government. The Company may not successfully compete with other companies and research institutions for government funding and funding from other private sources. Additionally, government-funding priorities are subject to frequent changes. For example, in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company recorded $13,978,000, $6,597,000 and $2,804,000, respectively, for government-sponsored research and development. There is no guarantee that the Company will receive funds for government-sponsored research in the future. If the Company is unable to fund its research and development activities through its operations or from outside sources, the Company may be unable to continue to innovate or bring its innovations to market on a timely or cost effective basis, or its innovations may be surpassed by other competitors or new technologies. The Companys success depends on new product development. The Companys continuing research and development program is designed to develop new products and to enhance and improve its current products. The Company plans to expend significant resources on the development of its new products. The successful development of its products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including: · unanticipated delays; · access to capital; · budget overruns; · technical problems; and · other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design, development and commercialization of new products and product enhancements, including for example, changes requested or required by governmental and regulatory agencies. Given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction of X-ray inspection systems, the Company cannot assure that its product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget, if at all. The Companys failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget would harm its business and prospects. The Companys success depends upon its ability to adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements. The market for the Companys products has been characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions and evolving industry standards and customer requirements. The Company believes that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future. The Companys success will depend, in part, upon its ability to enhance its existing products, successfully develop new products that meet changing customer and regulatory requirements and gain market acceptance. If the Company fails to do so, its products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology, in which case 11 its revenue and operating results would suffer. In developing any new product, the Company may be required to make a substantial investment before it can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If the Company fails to accurately foresee its customers needs and future activities, it may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue. The Company may not be able to compete successfully. A number of companies have developed products that compete with the Companys X-ray inspection products. Many of the Companys competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than it does. Some of its competitors have more extensive research, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and greater technical and personnel resources than the Company does, and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry. The Companys failure to compete successfully could decrease demand for its products or make its products obsolete. In the inspection systems market, competition is based primarily on the following factors: · product performance, functionality and quality; · price; · the overall cost of ownership of the system; · prior customer relationships; · technological capabilities of the product; · certification by government authorities; · local market presence; and · breadth of the sales and service organization. To remain competitive, the Company must develop new products and periodically enhance its existing products in a timely manner. The Company anticipates that it may have to adjust the prices of some of its products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors may emerge, and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines. The Companys business could be harmed if it is unable to protect its intellectual property. The Company relies primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, licensing arrangements and confidentiality procedures to protect its technology. Despite its precautions, the steps the Company has taken to protect its technology may be inadequate. Existing trade secret, patent, trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection. The Companys patents could be invalidated or circumvented. In addition, others may develop substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology, or competitors may offer equivalent products in competition with the Companys products, thereby substantially reducing the value of the Companys proprietary rights. The laws of some foreign countries in which the Companys products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not protect its products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. This may make the possibility of piracy of the Companys technology and products more likely. The Company cannot assure that the steps it has taken to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology. The Companys inability to protect its intellectual property could have a negative impact on its operations and financial results. The Companys business may be materially and adversely affected by infringement claims initiated by the Company or its competitors. Initiating or defending against the enforcement of the Companys intellectual property rights may result in significant, protracted, and costly litigation. The Company has previously been involved in various litigations involving its intellectual property and has been successful in protecting such interests to date. The Company expects intellectual property disputes to be an ordinary part of its business for the foreseeable future. The Company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of its intellectual property rights, or to establish the validity of its property rights. There can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in any such action. Litigation by or against the Company could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation results in a favorable outcome for the Company. In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, the Company could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, discontinue 12 the use of certain processes, or obtain licenses for the infringing technology. If a license were required, the Company cannot assure that it would be able to obtain one on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The Company cannot assure that it will be successful in developing non-infringing technology or that the cost or time required to develop such technology will be reasonable. The Companys success depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified management professionals. The Companys future success depends in large measure upon the continued contributions of its senior management team and other key personnel. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain key personnel or executive management in sufficient numbers, with the requisite skills or on acceptable terms necessary or advisable to support our continued growth. If we lose professionals or are unable to attract new talent, we will not be able to maintain our position in the market or grow our business. Existing external financing may not be available in the future. The Company may require additional capital to finance continuing operations. The Company cannot assure that operations will continue to be profitable, that it will generate levels of revenues and cash flows sufficient to fund operations, or, if necessary, that the Company will be able to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any existing financing arrangements may not be available or sufficient to meet the Companys cash needs or may not be available in the future, or, if available, at a cost that the Company believes is reasonable. Future sales of the Companys common stock by existing stockholders could depress the market price of the Companys common stock. Substantially all of the Companys outstanding shares of common stock are freely tradable without restriction or further registration. Affiliates must sell all shares they own in compliance with the volume and other requirements of Rule 144, except for the holding period requirements. Nevertheless, sales of substantial amounts of common stock by the Companys stockholders, or even the potential for such sales, may cause the market price of the Companys common stock to decline and could impair the Companys ability to raise capital through the sale of the Companys equity securities. The volatility of the Companys stock price could adversely affect an investment in the Companys common stock. The market price of the Companys common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. The Company believes that a variety of factors could cause the price of the Companys common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including: · announcements of developments related to the Companys business; · quarterly fluctuations in the Companys actual or anticipated operating results and order levels; · general conditions in the worldwide economy; · announcements of technological innovations; · new products or product enhancements by the Company or its competitors; · developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation; and · developments in the Companys relationships with its customers and suppliers. In addition, in recent years the stock market in general, and the markets for shares of small capitalization and high-tech companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of the Companys common stock. Provisions in the Companys articles of organization and the Companys shareholder rights plan may have the effect of discouraging advantageous offers for the Companys business or common stock, and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the Companys common stock. Provisions in the Companys articles of organization and the Companys shareholder rights plan may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the Companys common stock. Specifically, the Companys articles of organization authorize its Board of Directors to issue up to 100,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to fix certain rights, preferences, privileges and 13 restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued shares of preferred stock, to fix the number of shares constituting any such series, and to fix the designation of any such series, without further vote or action by its shareholders. The terms of any series of preferred stock, which may include priority claims to assets and dividends and special voting rights, could adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock and thereby reduce the value of the Companys common stock. The Company has no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock. The Company has in place a shareholder rights plan, which was renewed in April of 2008, under which its stockholders are entitled to purchase shares of its preferred stock under certain circumstances. These circumstances include the purchase of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock by a person or group, or the announcement of a tender or exchange offer to acquire 15% or more of the outstanding common stock. The shareholder rights plan may have the effect of impeding or preventing certain types of transactions involving a change in control of the Company that could be beneficial to the stockholders.
