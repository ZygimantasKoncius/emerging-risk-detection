ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this entire prospectus before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock, when and if we trade at a later date, could decline due to any of these risks. This could result in you losing all or part of your investment. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR COMPANY WE ARE AN EXPLORATION STAGE COMPANY, BUT HAVE NOT YET COMMENCED EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES ON OUR CLAIMS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. We were incorporated on February 29, 2008 and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities and the acquisition of the mineral claim. We have only recently commenced exploration on the Sky Property. Accordingly, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. We have not earned any revenues as of the date of this prospectus. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new mineral exploration companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the exploration of the mineral properties that we plan to undertake. Prior to 13 completion of our exploration stage, we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if mineral production is not forthcoming from the claims, we will not be able to continue business operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail. WE HAVE YET TO EARN REVENUE AND OUR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO RAISE FINANCING. AS A RESULT, OUR ACCOUNTANT BELIEVES THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. We have accrued net losses of $34,801 for the period from our inception to June 30, 2010, and have no revenues to date. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of our mineral claims. These factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. Stan J.H. Lee, CPA, our independent auditor, has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise. If we fail to raise sufficient capital when needed, we will not be able to complete our business plan. As a result we may have to liquidate our business and you may lose your investment. You should consider our auditor's comments when determining if an investment in Saguaro Resources, Inc. is appropriate. WITHOUT THE FUNDING FROM THIS OFFERING WE WILL BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN. We are an exploration stage company with no revenues or operating activities. Our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete the intended exploration program on our mineral claims; as of June 30, 2010, we had cash in the amount of $5,944. BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE DIFFICULTIES AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN MINERAL EXPLORATION VENTURES, WE FACE A HIGH RISK OF BUSINESS FAILURE. You should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new mineral exploration companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the exploration of the mineral properties that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to exploration, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. The Sky Property does not contain a known body of any commercial minerals and, therefore, any program conducted on the Sky Property would be an exploratory search of any minerals. There is no certainty that any expenditures made in the exploration of the Sky Property will result in discoveries of any commercial quantities of minerals. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable mineral deposits. Problems such as unusual or unexpected formations and other conditions are common to mineral exploration activities and often result in unsuccessful exploration efforts. If the results of our exploration program do not reveal viable commercial mineralization, we may decide to abandon our claim and acquire new claims for new exploration. Our ability to acquire additional claims will be dependent upon our possessing adequate capital resources when needed. If no funding is available, we may be forced to abandon our operations. WE HAVE NO KNOWN MINERAL RESERVES AND IF WE CANNOT FIND ANY, WE MAY HAVE TO CEASE OPERATIONS. We have no mineral reserves. If we do not find any commercially exploitable mineral reserves or if we cannot complete the exploration of any mineral reserves, either because we do not have the money to do so or because it is not economically feasible to do so, we may have to cease operations and you may lose your investment. Mineral exploration is highly speculative. It involves many risks and is often non-productive. Even if we are able to find mineral reserves on our property our production capability will be subject to further risks including: 14 - The costs of bringing the property into production including exploration work, preparation of production feasibility studies, and construction of production facilities, all of which we have not budgeted for; - The availability and costs of financing; - The ongoing costs of production; and - Risks related to environmental compliance regulations and restraints. The marketability of any minerals acquired or discovered may be affected by numerous factors which are beyond our control and which cannot be accurately predicted, such as market fluctuations, the lack of milling facilities and processing equipment near the Sky Property, and other factors such as government regulations, including regulations relating to allowable production, the importing and exporting of minerals, and environmental protection. Given the above noted risks, the chances of our finding and commercially exploiting reserves on our mineral properties are remote and funds expended on exploration will likely be lost. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT DANGERS INVOLVED IN MINERAL EXPLORATION, THERE IS A RISK THAT WE MAY INCUR LIABILITY OR DAMAGES AS WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. The search for valuable minerals involves numerous hazards. As a result, we may become subject to liability for such hazards, including pollution, cave-ins and other hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure. At the present time we have no insurance to cover against these hazards. The payment of such liabilities may result in our inability to complete our planned exploration program and/or obtain additional financing to fund our exploration program. AS WE UNDERTAKE EXPLORATION OF OUR MINERAL CLAIMS, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATION THAT MAY INCREASE THE ANTICIPATED COST OF OUR EXPLORATION PROGRAM. There are several governmental regulations that materially restrict mineral exploration. We will be subject to the laws of the State of Nevada as we carry out our exploration program. We may be required to obtain work permits, post bonds and perform remediation work for any physical disturbance to the land in order to comply with these laws. If we enter the production phase, the cost of complying with permit and regulatory environment laws will be greater because the impact on the project area is greater. Permits and regulations will control all aspects of the production program if the project continues to that stage. Examples of regulatory requirements include: (a) Water discharge will have to meet drinking water standards; (b) Dust generation will have to be minimal or otherwise re-mediated; (c) Dumping of material on the surface will have to be re-contoured and re-vegetated with natural vegetation; (d) An assessment of all material to be left on the surface will need to be environmentally benign; (e) Ground water will have to be monitored for any potential contaminants; (f) The socio-economic impact of the project will have to be evaluated and if deemed negative, will have to be remediated; and (g) There will have to be an impact report of the work on the local fauna and flora including a study of potentially endangered species. There is a risk that new regulations could increase our costs of doing business and prevent us from carrying out our exploration program. We will also have to sustain the cost of reclamation and environmental remediation for all exploration work undertaken. Both reclamation and environmental remediation refer to putting disturbed ground back as close to its original state as possible. Other potential pollution or damage must be cleaned-up and renewed along standard guidelines outlined in the usual permits. Reclamation is the process of bringing the land back to its natural state after completion of exploration activities. Environmental remediation refers to the physical activity of taking steps to remediate, or remedy, any environmental damage caused. The amount of these costs is not known at this time as we do not know the extent of the exploration program that will be undertaken beyond completion of the recommended work program. If remediation costs exceed our cash reserves we may be unable to complete our exploration program and have to abandon our operations. 15 BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND/OR DIRECTOR DOES NOT HAVE ANY FORMAL TRAINING SPECIFIC TO THE TECHNICALITIES OF MINERAL EXPLORATION, THERE IS A HIGHER RISK OUR BUSINESS WILL FAIL. Our sole officer and director is Lynn Briggs. Ms. Briggs has no formal training as a geologist or in the technical aspects of management of a mineral exploration company. Her prior business experiences have primarily been in research and reporting. With no direct training or experience in these areas, our management may not be fully aware of the specific requirements related to working within this industry. Our management's decisions and choices may not take into account standard engineering or managerial approaches mineral exploration companies commonly use. Consequently, our operations, earnings, and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to management's lack of experience in this industry. BECAUSE OUR CURRENT OFFICER/DIRECTOR HAS OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS, SHE MAY NOT BE ABLE OR WILLING TO DEVOTE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TIME TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, CAUSING OUR BUSINESS TO FAIL. Ms. Briggs, our officer/director, currently devotes approximately 4-5 hours per week providing management services to us. While she presently possesses adequate time to attend to our interest, it is possible that the demands on her from other obligations could increase, with the result that she would no longer be able to devote sufficient time to the management of our business. This could negatively impact our business development. OUR DIRECTOR WILL CONTINUE TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT CONTROL OVER OUR OPERATIONS, WHICH MEANS AS A MINORITY SHAREHOLDER, YOU WOULD HAVE NO CONTROL OVER CERTAIN MATTERS REQUIRING STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL THAT COULD AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO EVER RESELL ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING. Our executive officer and director owns 55% of our common stock. She has a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions, including the election of directors, approval of significant corporate transactions, changes in control of the company or other matters that could affect your ability to ever resell your shares. Her interests may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and thus result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders. OUR OFFICER AND DIRECTOR, LYNN BRIGGS, RESIDES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAKING IF DIFFICULT TO EFFECT SERVICE OF PROCESS UPON HER. Since our officer and director resides outside the United States, substantially all or a portion of her assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon her or to enforce against her judgments obtained in United States courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. THERE IS A RISK THAT OUR PROPERTY DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY KNOWN BODIES OF ORE RESULTING IN ANY FUNDS SPENT ON EXPLORATION BEING LOST. There is the likelihood of our mineral claim containing little or no economic mineralization or reserves. There is the possibility that our claim does not contain any reserves, resulting in any funds spent on exploration being lost. IF WE DISCOVER COMMERCIAL RESERVES OF PRECIOUS METALS ON OUR MINERAL PROPERTY, WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ADVANCE THE MINERAL CLAIMS INTO COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION. If our exploration program is successful in establishing ore of commercial tonnage and grade, we will require additional funds in order to advance the claim into commercial production. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors, including the market price for the minerals, investor acceptance of our claims and general market conditions. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing unavailable to us. We may be unable to obtain any such funds, or to obtain such funds on terms that we consider economically feasible and you may lose any investment you make in this offering. 16 IF OUR EXPLORATION PROGRAM IS SUCCESSFUL IN ESTABLISHING ORE OF COMMERCIAL TONNAGE AND GRADE, WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDS IN ORDER TO ADVANCE THE CLAIM INTO COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION. The most likely source of future funds is through the sale of equity capital. Any sale of share capital to raise operating funds will result in dilution to existing shareholders. IF ACCESS TO OUR MINERAL CLAIMS IS RESTRICTED BY INCLEMENT WEATHER, WE MAY BE DELAYED IN OUR EXPLORATION AND ANY FUTURE MINING EFFORTS. It is possible that snow or rain could cause the mining roads providing access to our claims to become impassable. If the roads are impassable we would be delayed in our exploration timetable. BASED ON CONSUMER DEMAND, THE GROWTH AND DEMAND FOR ANY ORE WE MAY RECOVER FROM OUR CLAIMS MAY BE SLOWED, RESULTING IN REDUCED REVENUES TO THE COMPANY. Our success will be dependent on the growth of demand for ores. If consumer demand slows our revenues may be significantly affected. This could limit our ability to generate revenues and our financial condition and operating results may be harmed. OUR CONSULTING GEOLOGIST, MR. JAMES MCLEOD, HAS WORKED WITH A NUMBER OF EXPLORATION STAGE COMPANIES WHICH HAVE NOT MOVED FORWARD IN THEIR EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES. We are dependent on the expertise of our consulting geologist in geology and exploration. Since 1999, Mr. McLeod has been an officer, director, or geologist for over twenty companies, most of which have not moved forward with exploration activities, and at least five of which have changed businesses and completely abandoned exploration activities. If we do not move forward with our exploration activities or our exploration activities do not have favorable results our business could fail. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not Applicable.
