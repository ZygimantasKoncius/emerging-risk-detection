Item 1A. Risk Factors Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this report, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business Our near-term success is dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, SILENORtm (doxepin hydrochloride), and we cannot be certain that it will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized. SILENORtm is currently being evaluated in four Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of insomnia and will require the successful completion of these Phase III clinical trials before we are able to submit an NDA to the FDA for approval. If our Phase III or other clinical trials fail to demonstrate that SILENORtm is safe and effective, it will not receive regulatory approval. We are seeking a commercial partner for SILENORtm. If a partnership becomes effective prior to the filing of the NDA, actions on the part of the partner could delay our NDA filing. Even if SILENORtm receives FDA approval, it may never be successfully commercialized. In addition, we may have inadequate financial or other resources to pursue this product candidate through the clinical trial process or through commercialization. We do not have patent protection for SILENORtm in any jurisdiction outside the United States, which may limit our ability to commercialize SILENORtm. Furthermore, the patent protection in the United States for SILENORtm for the treatment of insomnia is limited to lower dosages ranging from a lower limit of 0.5 mg to various upper limits up to 20 mg of its active ingredient, doxepin. Doxepin is prescribed at dosages ranging from 75 mg to 300 mg daily for the treatment of depression and anxiety and is available in generic form in strengths as low as 10 mg in capsule form as well as a concentrated liquid form dispensed by a marked dropper and calibrated for 5 mg. As a result, we may face competition from the off-label use of these other dosage forms of generic doxepin. Off-label use occurs when a drug that is approved by the FDA for one indication is prescribed by physicians for a different, unapproved indication. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or are unable to successfully commercialize, SILENORtm, we may be unable to generate revenue, we may be unable to become profitable, and we may be unable to continue our operations. We expect intense competition in the insomnia marketplace for SILENORtm and in the target markets for our other product candidates, and new products may emerge that provide different and/or better therapeutic alternatives for the disorders that our product candidates are intended to treat. We are developing SILENORtm for the treatment of insomnia, which will compete with well established drugs for this indication including Ambien and Sonata, both GABA-acting hypnotics. Recently, Sepracor Inc.s Lunesta, a GABA-acting hypnotic, Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America, Inc.s Rozerem, a melatonin receptor antagonist, and Sanofi-Synthélabo Inc.s Ambien CR, a controlled-release formulation of the current product, Ambien, were approved by the FDA for the treatment of insomnia. An NDA for at least one other product, Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.s indiplon, a GABA-acting hypnotic, has reportedly been submitted to the FDA and is under review. Furthermore, the patent for the original form of Ambien, which accounted for $2.3 billion of the $3.3 billion insomnia market in 2005, expires in October 2006. As a result, generic versions of Ambien are expected to reach the market shortly thereafter. Generic versions of Ambien can be expected to be priced significantly lower than approved, branded insomnia products. Sales of all of these drugs may reduce the available market for, and the price we are able to charge for, any product developed by us for these indications. We are developing nalmefene for the treatment of pathological gambling. Currently, there are no FDA-approved products for this indication. However, controlled clinical trials using the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, which is available in generic form, have demonstrated clinical benefit for patients diagnosed with pathological gambling. Additionally, some controlled clinical trials suggest that SSRIs, such as 24 Table of Contents GlaxoSmithKline plcs Paxil and Solvay Pharmaceuticals Luvox, may have a potential clinical effect. TOPAMAX, marketed by Ortho-McNeil Neurologics, is also being studied for the treatment of pathological gambling. We are developing acamprosate for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. There are no FDA-approved products for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia, although several companies are reportedly in Phase II and Phase III clinical trials to evaluate product candidates for this condition. Merck KGaA is investigating sarizotan hydrochloride, a serotonin 5HT1A agonist, in Phase III clinical trials for treatment-associated dyskinesias in patients with Parkinsons disease. Additionally, Juvantia Pharma Ltd. is investigating fipamezole, an adrenergic antagonist, in Phase II clinical trials for treatment-associated dyskinesias in Parkinsons disease and Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. is investigating ACP-103, a 5-HT2A inverse agonist, in Phase I clinical trials for levodopa-induced dyskinesias in patients with Parkinsons disease. These product candidates may be approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities and commercialized ahead of acamprosate. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and intense technological change. We face, and will continue to face, competition in the development and marketing of our product candidates from academic institutions, government agencies, research institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. There can be no assurance that developments by others will not render SILENORtm or our other product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. Furthermore, new developments, including the development of other drug technologies and methods of preventing the incidence of disease, occur in the pharmaceutical industry at a rapid pace. These developments may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater:  capital resources;  research and development resources, including personnel and technology;  regulatory experience;  preclinical study and clinical trial experience;  expertise in prosecution of intellectual property rights; and  manufacturing, distribution and sales and marketing experience. As a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, useful and less costly than ours and may also be more successful than we in manufacturing and marketing their products. In addition, if we receive regulatory approvals for our products, manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities are likely to be significant competitive factors. We currently have no commercial manufacturing capability, sales force or marketing infrastructure. In addition, many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater capital resources, research and development resources, manufacturing and marketing experience and production facilities than we. Many of these competitors also have significantly greater resources for undertaking clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals. Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could result in increased costs to us and delay or limit our ability to generate revenues. Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time or be completed on 25 Table of Contents schedule, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays related to:  obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial;  reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;  manufacturing sufficient quantities of a product candidate;  obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;  recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including competition from other clinical trial programs for the same indication as our product candidates; and  retaining patients who have initiated a clinical trial but may be prone to withdraw due to side effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy or personal issues, or who are lost to further follow-up. In addition, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:  failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;  inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;  unforeseen safety issues; or  lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to institutional review boards for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in completion of, or if we terminate, our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate. Even if we are able to ultimately commercialize our product candidates, other therapies for the same indications may have been introduced to the market and established a competitive advantage. Our clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through preclinical testing and clinical trials that the product is safe and effective for use in each target indication. To date, we have not successfully completed any Phase III clinical trials and we have not completed all planned preclinical and Phase I clinical trials for each of our product candidates. For example, in addition to our ongoing Phase III clinical trials for SILENORtm, we are undertaking several Phase I clinical trials to evaluate the effect of food on the absorption of the drug and the effect of SILENORtm when co-administered with other drugs. With regard to nalmefene, we plan to initiate a clinical trial evaluating the product candidates cardiac effects on patients measured using an electrocardiogram. With regard to acamprosate, various preclinical and Phase I clinical trials are planned to facilitate the selection and evaluation of a formulation for the product candidate to be tested in subsequent trials. The results from preclinical testing and clinical trials that we have completed may not be predictive of results obtained in future preclinical and clinical trials, and there can be no assurance that we will demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals or result in marketable products. A number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials. If our drug candidates are not shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials, the resulting delays in developing other compounds and conducting related preclinical testing 26 Table of Contents and clinical trials, as well as the potential need for additional financing, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization. Undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications, and in turn prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and generating revenues from their sale. For example, in a Phase I clinical trial of nalmefene performed by our licensor, two patients were reported by the investigator to have a prolonged QTc interval, which is an electrocardiogram change in patients which, if significantly prolonged, may result in an abnormal heart rhythm with adverse consequences including fainting, dizziness, loss of consciousness and death. In a final report, based on corrected values as determined by the cardiologist responsible for the central laboratory evaluation, these QTc findings were determined to be within the normal range of variation and incorrectly designated as adverse events. As with most new drugs, a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the cardiac effects of nalmefene on patients measured using an electrocardiogram is planned and we will continue to assess the side effect profile of nalmefene and our other product candidates in our ongoing clinical development program. In addition, if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by the product:  regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a black box warning or a contraindication;  regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;  we may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product; and  our reputation may suffer. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing the product candidate, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from its sale. Additionally, the FDA has directed manufacturers of all antidepressant drugs to revise their product labels to include a black box warning and expanded warning statements regarding an increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children and adolescents being treated with these agents. SILENORtms active ingredient, doxepin, is used in the treatment of depression and the package insert includes such a black box warning statement. Although SILENORtm is not intended to be indicated for or used in the treatment of depression and our proposed insomnia dosage is less than one-tenth of that of doxepin for the treatment of depression, nor do we currently intend to evaluate SILENORtm for the treatment of insomnia in children or adolescents, we cannot assure you that a similar warning statement will not be required. There is no assurance that we will be granted regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The clinical trials of our product candidates are, and the manufacturing and marketing of our products will be, subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and in other countries where we intend to test and market our product candidates. Prior to marketing, any product developed by us must undergo an extensive regulatory approval process. We have not requested nor received regulatory approval for any product from the FDA or any other regulatory body. This regulatory process, which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each compound to establish its safety and efficacy, can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and may include post-marketing studies and surveillance. Data obtained from preclinical testing and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in FDA policy for drug approval during the 27 Table of Contents period of product development and FDA regulatory review of each submitted NDA. Similar delays may also be encountered in foreign countries. There can be no assurance that regulatory approval will be obtained for any drugs developed by us. A failure to obtain requisite regulatory approvals or to obtain approvals of the scope requested will delay or preclude us from marketing our products or limit the commercial use of the products, and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties. Even if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a products indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies. For example, the label ultimately approved for SILENORtm, if any, may include a restriction on the term of its use, or it may not include one or more of our intended indications  the treatment of sleep onset, maintenance and duration. Similarly, although doxepin, at higher dosages than we plan to incorporate in SILENORtm, is not currently and has never been a Schedule IV controlled substance, we cannot be certain that SILENORtm will be a non-scheduled drug until the FDA and the DEA complete their review. Our product candidates will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements for the labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information on the drug. In addition, approved products, manufacturers and manufacturers facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections. If a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:  issue warning letters or untitled letters;  impose civil or criminal penalties;  suspend regulatory approval;  suspend any ongoing clinical trials;  refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us;  impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or  seize or detain products or require a product recall. Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval in the United States, we may never receive approval or commercialize our products outside of the United States. In order to market any products outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States as well as other risks. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States. As described above, such effects include the risks that our product candidates may not be approved for all indications requested, which could limit the uses of our product candidates and have an adverse effect on potential royalties and product sales, and that such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or require costly, post-marketing follow-up studies. 28 Table of Contents If the manufacturers upon whom we rely fail to produce our products in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, or to comply with stringent regulations applicable to pharmaceutical drug manufacturers, we may face delays in the development and commercialization of, or be unable to meet demand for, our products and may lose potential revenues. We do not manufacture any of our product candidates, and we do not plan to develop any capacity to do so. Patheon Pharmaceuticals Inc. manufactures clinical supplies of our SILENORtm and nalmefene product candidates, and we will also contract with a third party to manufacture our acamprosate product candidate. We have also entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Patheon Pharmaceuticals Inc. to manufacture our commercial supply of SILENORtm. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up initial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product candidates and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Our manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may terminate their agreements with us. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, our ability to provide product candidates to patients in our clinical trials would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of our clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining our clinical trial program and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new trials at significant additional expense or terminate the trials completely. We do not have alternate manufacturing plans in place at this time. If we need to change to other commercial manufacturers, the FDA and comparable foreign regulators must approve these manufacturers facilities and processes prior to our use, which would require new testing and compliance inspections, and the new manufacturers would have to be educated in or independently develop the processes necessary for the production of our products. Any of these factors could cause us to delay or suspend clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, entail higher costs or result in our being unable to effectively commercialize our products. Furthermore, if our manufacturers failed to deliver the required commercial quantities of bulk drug substance or finished product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and we would lose potential revenues. In addition, all manufacturers of our products must comply with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. These requirements include quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our products may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. We have little control over our manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any quantities supplied is compromised due to our manufacturers failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products. We rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and prepare our electronic NDA filings. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates. We rely on CROs, primarily Synteract, Inc., to conduct our clinical trials for our SILENORtm and nalmefene product candidates, and we may depend on other CROs and independent clinical investigators to conduct our future clinical trials. CROs play a significant role in the conduct of our clinical trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. We also will rely on a CRO to prepare our electronic NDA filing. CROs and investigators are not our employees, and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that 29 Table of Contents they devote to our programs. If Synteract, other CROs or independent investigators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our programs, or if their performance is substandard, it will delay the approval of our FDA applications and our introductions of new products. Failure of the CROs to meet their obligations could adversely affect clinical development of our products. Moreover, these independent investigators and CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If independent investigators and CROs assist our competitors at our expense, it could harm our competitive position. Materials necessary to manufacture our product candidates may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which may delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates. We rely on the manufacturers of our product candidates to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce the compounds for our clinical trials and will rely on them for commercial distribution if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates. Suppliers may not sell these materials to our manufacturers at the time we need them or on commercially reasonable terms. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these materials by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these materials. If our manufacturers are unable to obtain these materials for our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates would be delayed, significantly impacting our ability to develop our product candidates. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would materially affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates. If we are unable to establish a sales and marketing infrastructure or enter into collaborations with partners to perform these functions, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates. We currently do not have significant internal sales, distribution and marketing capabilities. In order to commercialize any of our product candidates, we must either acquire or internally develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, or enter into collaborations with partners to perform these services for us. In the United States, we plan to build our own sales force to market our products directly to psychiatrists and neurologists and other targeted physicians. The acquisition or development of a sales and distribution infrastructure for our domestic operations will require substantial resources, which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel and negatively impact our product development efforts. Moreover, we may not be able to hire a sales force that is sufficient in size or has adequate expertise. To maximize the value of our product candidates, we will need to enter into collaborations with larger pharmaceutical partners to commercialize our products outside of the psychiatric and neurology specialty markets. We may not be able to enter into collaborations on acceptable terms, if at all. We also face competition in our search for partners with whom we may collaborate. By entering into these strategic collaborations, we may rely on our partners for financial resources and for development, commercialization and regulatory expertise. Our partners may fail to develop or effectively commercialize our product candidates because they:  do not have sufficient resources or decide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints, such as limited cash or human resources;  decide to pursue a competitive potential product that had been developed outside of the collaboration; or  cannot obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. 30 Table of Contents We face potential product liability exposure, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization. The use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:  decreased demand for our product candidates;  impairment of our business reputation;  withdrawal of clinical trial participants;  costs of related litigation;  substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;  loss of revenues; and  the inability to commercialize our product candidates. We have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials with a $5 million annual aggregate coverage limit, and our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business. If any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval do not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenues that we generate from their sales will be limited. The commercial success of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community and reimbursement of them by third-party payors, including government payors. The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:  our ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy;  relative convenience and ease of administration;  prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;  limitations or warnings contained in a products FDA-approved labeling, including, for example, potential black box warnings associated with the active ingredient in SILENORtm;  availability of alternative treatments, including, in the case of SILENORtm, a number of competitive products already approved for the treatment of insomnia or expected to be commercially launched in the near future;  pricing and cost effectiveness;  effectiveness of our or our collaborators sales and marketing strategies; and  our ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement. 31 Table of Contents If our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products, and we may not become or remain profitable. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. Our failure to successfully acquire, develop and market additional product candidates or approved products would impair our ability to grow. As part of our growth strategy, we intend to acquire, develop and market additional products and product candidates. Because we neither have, nor currently intend to establish, internal research capabilities, we are dependent upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, university scientists and other researchers to sell or license products to us. The success of this strategy depends upon our ability to identify, select and acquire promising pharmaceutical product candidates and products. The process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition of a product candidate or approved product is lengthy and complex. Other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for the license or acquisition of product candidates and approved products. We may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates on terms that we find acceptable, or at all. Further, any product candidate that we acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot assure you that any products that we develop or approved products that we acquire will be manufactured or produced profitably, successfully commercialized or widely accepted in the marketplace. Our business depends on our ability to acquire or in-license products and if we do not successfully acquire or license related product candidates or integrate them into our operations, we may incur unexpected costs and disruptions to our business. An important part of our business strategy is to continue to develop a pipeline of product candidates by acquiring or in-licensing products, businesses or technologies that we believe are a strategic fit with our business and complement our existing product candidates. Future acquisitions, however, may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:  exposure to unknown liabilities;  disruption of our business and diversion of our managements time and attention to develop acquired products or technologies;  incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of securities to pay for acquisitions;  higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;  increased amortization expenses;  difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;  impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and  inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses. We have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. In particular, we may compete with larger pharmaceutical companies and other competitors in our efforts to establish new collaborations and 32 Table of Contents in-licensing opportunities. These competitors likely will have access to greater financial resources than us and may have greater expertise in identifying and evaluating new opportunities. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. We are subject to uncertainty relating to health care reform measures and reimbursement policies which, if not favorable to our product candidates, could hinder or prevent our product candidates commercial success. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect:  our ability to set a price we believe is fair for our products;  our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability;  the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers and collaborators; and  the availability of capital. In the United States, given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care, Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform, the cost of prescription drugs and the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid systems. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 provides a new Medicare prescription drug benefit which became effective in January 2006 and mandates other reforms. While we cannot predict the full outcome of the implementation of this legislation, it is possible that the new Medicare prescription drug benefit, which will be managed by private health insurers and other managed care organizations, will result in additional government reimbursement for prescription drugs, which may make some prescription drugs more affordable but may further exacerbate industry-wide pressure to reduce prescription drug prices. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable. Our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations establish appropriate coverage and reimbursement levels for the cost of our products and related treatments. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Also, legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs may result in lower prices for our product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage and reimbursement programs. The cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could harm our ability to market our products and significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product. We will need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth. As of March 9, 2006, we had 25 full-time employees. We will need to continue to expand our managerial, operational, financial and other resources in order to manage and fund our operations and clinical trials, continue our development activities and commercialize our product candidates. Our management and personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Our need to effectively manage our operations, growth and various projects requires that we:  manage our clinical trials effectively, including our Phase III clinical trials for SILENORtm and our Phase II/ III clinical trials for nalmefene, which are being conducted at numerous distinct clinical trial sites;  manage our internal development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to collaborators and other third parties; 33 Table of Contents  continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; and  attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees. We may be unable to successfully implement these tasks on a larger scale and, accordingly, may not achieve our development and commercialization goals. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific and clinical personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses, particularly in the San Diego, California area. If we are not able to attract and retain necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will impede significantly the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy. In particular, if we lose any members of our senior management team, we may not be able to find suitable replacements, and our business may be harmed as a result. Our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. We are highly dependent on the product acquisition, development, regulatory and commercialization expertise of our senior management. If we lose one or more of the members of our senior management team or other key employees, our ability to implement our business strategy successfully could be seriously harmed. Replacing key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products successfully. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these additional key personnel. In addition, we have scientific and clinical advisors who assist us in formulating our product development and clinical strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us, or may have arrangements with other companies to assist in the development of products that may compete with ours. Risks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements We will require substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our development programs or commercialization efforts. We are a development-stage company with no revenues, and our operations to date have generated substantial and increasing needs for cash. We expect our negative cash flows from operations to continue until we obtain regulatory approval for SILENORtm and are able to commercialize the product candidate ourselves or establish a partnership or collaboration with a pharmaceutical company to broaden the potential reach of sales and marketing efforts for SILENORtm. The development and approval of SILENORtm and our other product candidates and the acquisition and development of additional products or product candidates by us, as well as the development of our sales and marketing organizations, will require a commitment of substantial funds. Our future capital requirements will depend on, and could increase significantly as a result of, many factors, including:  the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish;  the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other development activities;  the scope, prioritization and number of clinical development programs we pursue;  the costs and timing of regulatory approval;  the costs of establishing or contracting for sales and marketing capabilities;  the extent to which we acquire or in-license new products, technologies or businesses;  the effect of competing technological and market developments; and  the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights. 34 Table of Contents We believe, based on our current operating plan, that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2005 will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. We intend to seek additional funding through strategic alliances and may seek additional funding through public or private sales of our equity securities. In addition, we may obtain equipment leases and may pursue opportunities to obtain debt financing in the future. There can be no assurance, however, that additional equity or debt financing will be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our planned development, commercialization or expansion activities. Raising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing arrangements may cause dilution to existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders ownership will be diluted. Any debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem our stock or make investments. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. We have never generated revenues or been profitable, and we may not be able to generate revenues sufficient to achieve profitability. We are a development-stage company and have not generated any revenues or been profitable since inception, and it is possible that we will not achieve profitability. We incurred net losses of approximately $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. We cannot assure you that we will achieve significant revenues, if any, or that we will ever achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate or if operating expenses exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. We expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. The revenues we generate, if any, and our operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:  our addition or termination of development programs or funding support;  variations in the level of expenses related to our existing three product candidates or future development programs;  our execution of collaborative, licensing or other arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;  any intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved; and  regulatory developments affecting our product candidates or those of our competitors. If our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance. 35 Table of Contents The use of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited. Net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits may expire and not be used. As of December 31, 2005, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $41.4 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $39.8 million, the majority of which were generated in California. We have federal research and development tax credits of $1.5 million and California research and development tax credits of $1.6 million. Both federal net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits have a 20 year carry forward period and begin to expire in 2023 and 2024, respectively. California net operating loss carryforwards have a 10 year carry forward period and begin to expire in 2013. California research and development tax credits have no expiration. Pursuant to Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, annual use of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited in the event a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% occurs within a three-year period. We determined that such an ownership change occurred as of June 30, 2005 as a result of various stock issuances used to finance the Companys development activities. This ownership change resulted in limitations on the utilization of tax attributes, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. We estimate that approximately $284,000 of our California net operating loss carryforwards were effectively eliminated. Additionally, approximately $18,291,000 and $17,335,000 of our federal and California net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, and $887,000 of our federal research and development credits were subject to limitation at December 31, 2005. A portion of the limited net operating loss carryforwards become available for use each year and we estimate that approximately $2.8 million of the restricted net operating loss carryforwards become available each year between 2006 and 2010, decreasing to approximately $1.0 million thereafter. Net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits generated subsequent to the ownership change are not subject to limitations. At December 31, 2005, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $23,060,000 and $22,436,000, respectively, and research and development credits of $600,000 that were generated after the ownership change and therefore not limited. These net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards could be subject to future limitations if additional ownership changes occur. Risks Relating to Intellectual Property The patent rights that we have in-licensed covering SILENORtm are limited to certain low-dosage strengths in the United States, and our market opportunity for this product candidate may be limited by the lack of patent protection for higher dosage strengths and the lack of patent protection in other territories. Although we have an exclusive, worldwide license for SILENORtm for the treatment of insomnia through the life of the last patent to expire, which is expected to occur in 2020, we do not have patent protection for SILENORtm in any jurisdiction outside the United States. In addition, although our licensed patent for the treatment of transient insomnia is scheduled to expire in 2020, our licensed patent for the treatment of chronic insomnia is scheduled to expire in March 2013. Accordingly, a competitor could file an NDA for the development of doxepin for a chronic insomnia indication as early as March 2013. Furthermore, the patent protection in the United States for SILENORtm for the treatment of insomnia is limited to lower dosages ranging from a lower limit of 0.5 mg to various upper limits up to 20 mg of the active ingredient, doxepin. Doxepin is prescribed at dosages ranging from 75 mg to 300 mg daily for the treatment of depression and anxiety and is available in generic form in strengths as low as 10 mg in capsule form, as well as in a concentrated liquid form dispensed by a marked dropper and calibrated for 5 mg. As a result, we may face competition from the off-label use of these other dosage forms of generic doxepin. In addition, others may attempt to commercialize low-dose doxepin in the European Union, Canada, Mexico or other markets where we do not have patent protection for SILENORtm. Due to the lack of patent protection for doxepin in territories outside the United States and the potential for correspondingly lower prices for the drug in those markets, it is possible that patients will seek to acquire low-dose doxepin in those other territories. The off-label use of doxepin in the United States or the importation of doxepin from foreign markets could adversely 36 Table of Contents affect the commercial potential for SILENORtm and adversely affect our overall business and financial results. We have initiated a reexamination and a reissue of one of our patents covering SILENORtm which will result in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office narrowing certain claims and could result in the cancellation or rejection of certain or all of the claims of the patent. Due to some recently identified prior art, we initiated a reexamination of one of the patents we have licensed covering SILENORtm, specifically U.S. Patent No. 5,502,047, Treatment For Insomnia, which claims the treatment of chronic insomnia using doxepin in a daily dosage of 0.5 mg to 20 mg and expires in March 2013. The reexamination proceedings have terminated and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is expected to issue a reexamination certificate narrowing certain claims, so that the broadest dosage ranges claimed by us are 0.5 mg to 20 mg for otherwise healthy patients, 0.5 mg to 20 mg for patients with insomnia resulting from depression, and 0.5 mg to 4 mg for all chronic insomnia patients. In addition, we have requested reissue of this same patent to add intermediate dosage ranges below 10 mg and to consider some additional prior art that is relevant primarily to claims for treating insomnia in depressed patients. During reissue, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office could require narrowing or cancellation of certain claims or could reject all of the claims of this patent. Although we believe that our licensed patents will restrict the ability of competitors to market doxepin with identical drug labeling, we cannot be certain of the outcome of the proceeding U.S. Patent and Trademark Offices pending reissue. We have licensed our product candidates from third parties. If we default on any of our obligations under those licenses, we could lose rights to product candidates that are important to our business. We license rights to product candidates that are important to our business, and we expect to enter into similar licenses in the future. For instance, we acquired our three product candidates through exclusive licensing arrangements. Under these licenses we are subject to commercialization and development, sublicensing, royalty, insurance and other obligations. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, or otherwise breach these license agreements, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license in whole or to terminate the exclusive nature of the license. Loss of any of these licenses or the exclusivity rights provided therein could harm our financial condition and operating results. For example, our license agreement for SILENORtm requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize the product candidate. To the extent we are unable to comply with these obligations, the license may be terminated. Restrictions on our patent rights relating to our product candidates may limit our ability to prevent third parties from competing against us. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, preserve our trade secrets, prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. The patent rights that we have in-licensed relating to our product candidates are limited in ways that may affect our ability to exclude third parties from competing against us if we receive regulatory approval to market these product candidates. In particular, we do not hold composition of matter patents covering the active pharmaceutical ingredients of any of our product candidates. Composition of matter patents on active pharmaceutical ingredients are the strongest form of intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical products as they apply without regard to any method of use or other type of limitation. As a result, competitors who obtain the requisite regulatory approval can offer products with the same active ingredients as our products so long as the competitors do not infringe any method of use or formulation patents that we may hold. The principal patent protection that covers, or that we expect will cover, our product candidates is method of use patents. This type of patent protects the product only when used or sold for the specified method. However, this type of patent does not limit a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside of the patented method. Moreover, physicians may prescribe such a competitive identical product for off-label indications that are covered by the applicable patents. 37 Table of Contents Although such off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method of use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute. Because products with active ingredients identical to ours have been on the market for many years, there can be no assurance that these other products were never used off-label in such a manner that such prior usage would not affect the validity of our method of use patents. One of our licensed patents is currently involved in post-issuance proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and no assurance can be given that any claims will survive those proceedings in their current form, or at all. Patent applications in the United States are confidential for a period of time until they are published, and publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature typically lags actual discoveries by several months. As a result, we cannot be certain that the inventors of the issued patents that we in-licensed were the first to conceive of inventions covered by pending patent applications or that the inventors were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants. We also have invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and certain consultants. There can be no assurance that inventions relevant to us will not be developed by a person not bound by an invention assignment agreement with us. There can be no assurance that binding agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers. In addition, as is commonplace in the biotechnology industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business. Our commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we and our collaborators are developing products. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our potential products may give rise to claims that our products infringe the patent rights of others. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. We may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our product candidates and/or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights. If one of these patents was found to cover our product candidates, proprietary technologies or their uses, we or our collaborators could be required to pay damages and could be unable to commercialize our product candidates or use our proprietary technologies unless we or they obtained a license to the patent. A license may not be available to us or our collaborators on acceptable terms, if at all. In 38 Table of Contents addition, during litigation, the patent holder could obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable right which could prohibit us from making, using or selling our products, technologies or methods. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries generally. If a third party claims that we or our collaborators infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including, but not limited to:  infringement and other intellectual property claims which, with or without merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and may divert our managements attention from our core business;  substantial damages for infringement, including treble damages and attorneys fees, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product at issue infringes on or violates the third partys rights;  a court prohibiting us from selling or licensing the product unless the third party licenses its product rights to us, which it is not required to do;  if a license is available from the third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, fees and/or grant cross-licenses to our products; and  redesigning our products or processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial funds and time. We have conducted a search of patents issued to third parties, however no assurance can be given that patents do not exist, have not been filed, or could not be filed or issued, which contain claims covering our products, technology or methods. Because of the number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our field, we believe there is a risk that third parties may allege they have patent rights encompassing our products, technology or methods. Risks Relating to Securities Markets and Investment in Our Stock There may not be a viable public market for our common stock, and market volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment. Our common stock had not been publicly traded prior to our initial public offering, which was completed in December 2005, and an active trading market may not develop or be sustained. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to support operations and finance the growth and development of our business and do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Therefore, investors will have to rely on appreciation in our stock price and a liquid trading market in order to achieve a gain on their investment. The market prices for securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have historically been highly volatile, and the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. For example, since our initial public offering through March 9, 2006, the trading prices for our common stock ranged from a high of $21.05 to a low of $9.69. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:  changes in the regulatory status of SILENORtm or our other product candidates, including results of our clinical trials;  announcements of new products or technologies, commercial relationships or other events by us or our competitors;  events affecting our three existing in-license agreements and any future collaborations, commercial agreements and grants;  variations in our quarterly operating results;  changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance; 39 Table of Contents  regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;  fluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies;  sales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;  additions or departures of key personnel; and  discussion of us or our stock price by the financial and scientific press and in online investor communities. The realization of any of the risks described in these Risk Factors could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. In addition, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Any such litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources, which could hurt our business, operating results and financial condition. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include a classified board of directors, a prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders, and the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. We will incur increased costs as a result of changes in laws and regulations relating to corporate governance matters. As a public reporting company, we must comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission and by the Nasdaq Stock Market, including expanded disclosures, accelerated reporting requirements and more complex accounting rules. Compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other requirements will increase our costs and require additional management resources. Additionally, these laws and regulations could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. Based on our current public float, we are required to comply with Section 404 by December 31, 2006. We are presently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these laws and regulations and cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to their requirements. 40 Table of Contents If our executive officers, directors and largest stockholders choose to act together, they may be able to control our operations and act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders. As of December 31, 2005, our executive officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock beneficially owned approximately 69.2% of our common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, would be able to control all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders, and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders. We may allocate the net proceeds from our initial public offering in ways that you and other stockholders may not approve. We intend to use the net proceeds from our initial public offering:  to fund clinical trials for our three development programs;  for marketing, general and administrative expenses; and  for other research and development expenses. Our management and directors will, however, have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from the offering and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not necessarily improve our operating results or enhance the value of our common stock. Future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline. Persons who were our stockholders prior to the sale of shares in our initial public offering continue to hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock that they will be able to sell in the public market in the near future. Significant portions of these shares are held by a small number of stockholders. Sales by our current stockholders of a substantial number of shares, or the expectation that such sales may occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. Moreover, the holders of a substantial number of shares of common stock may have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements to permit the resale of their shares in the public market or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. We have also registered all common stock that we may issue under our employee benefits plans. As a result, these shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to restrictions under the securities laws. In addition, certain of our directors and executive officers may in the future establish programmed selling plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act for the purpose of effecting sales of common stock. If any of these events cause a large number of our shares to be sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable.
