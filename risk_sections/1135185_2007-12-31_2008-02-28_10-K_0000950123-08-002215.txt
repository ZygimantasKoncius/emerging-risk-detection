ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider each of the following Risk Factors and all other information in this Report. These Risk Factors are not the only ones facing us. Our operations could also be impaired by additional risks and uncertainties. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS Risks Related to Our ACMI Business We depend on a limited number of significant customers for our ACMI business, and the loss of one or more of such customers could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, our ACMI business accounted for approximately 23.1%, 27.6% and 28.8%, respectively, of our operating revenues. Our ACMI business depends on a limited number of significant customers, which customers numbered between seven and 12 during these periods. In addition, Emirates accounted for 10.8%, 11.9% and 9.8% of our total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We typically enter into ACMI contracts with our customers for terms ranging from three to six years on Boeing 747-400s. The terms of our existing contracts are scheduled to expire on a staggered basis over the next six years. There is a risk that any one of our significant ACMI customers may not renew their ACMI contracts with us on favorable terms or at all. Entering into ACMI contracts with new customers generally requires a long sales cycle, and as a result, if our ACMI contracts are not renewed, and there is a resulting delay in entering into new contracts, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We could be adversely affected if a large number of Boeing 747-400 passenger-to-freighter converted aircraft enter the ACMI market and could cause ACMI rates to decrease. As passenger airlines begin to retire Boeing 747-400 aircraft from passenger service, many of these aircraft are undergoing conversion to freighters. Although inferior in operating performance to the Boeing 747-400 specialty built freighter that we operate, if a significant number of these 747-400 converted freighter aircraft become available to our competitors, it could cause ACMI rates and underlying aircraft values to decrease. If that was to occur our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We could be adversely affected if our new Boeing 747-8F aircraft are not delivered on schedule or if such aircraft do not meet expected performance specifications. In September 2006, we placed an order for 12 new Boeing 747-8F aircraft that are currently scheduled to be delivered in 2010 and 2011. As part of this transaction, we also hold rights to purchase up to an additional 14 Boeing 747-8F aircraft. The addition of these new aircraft is a material component of our growth and fleet renewal strategy. Although the Boeing 747-8F aircraft shares many of the same components used in our other Boeing 747 models, it is a new aircraft model and has not yet received the necessary regulatory approvals and certifications. A significant delay in Boeings production or delivery schedule, including delay in receiving necessary approvals and certifications, could delay the delivery and deployment of these aircraft. Although Boeing has provided us with performance guarantees, the new aircraft may not meet the expected performance specifications, which could make it more difficult for us to deploy these aircraft in a timely manner or at favorable rates. 14 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our AMC Charter Business We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our AMC Charter business, and a substantial portion of these revenues were generated pursuant to expansion flying, as opposed to fixed contract arrangements with the AMC. In the longer term, we expect that the revenues from our AMC Charter business may decline from current levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, approximately 24.1%, 22.1% and 27.2%, respectively, of our operating revenues were derived from our AMC Charter business. In each of these years, the revenues derived from expansion flights for the Air Mobility Command significantly exceeded the value of the fixed flight component of our AMC contract. While we expect that our AMC Charter business, especially expansion flights, will generate a significant amount of our revenue for the foreseeable future, future revenues from this business may decline from current levels as a result of reduced US military heavy lift requirements. Revenues from our AMC Charter business are derived from one-year contracts that the Air Mobility Command is not required to renew. Our current AMC contract runs from October 1, 2007 through September 30, 2008. Changes in national and international political priorities can significantly affect the volume of our AMC Charter business, especially the volume of expansion flying. Any decrease in U.S. military activity could reduce our AMC Charter business. In addition, our share of the total AMC Charter business depends on several factors, including the total fleet size we commit to the CRAF program and the total number of aircraft deployed by our partners and competitors in the program. The Air Mobility Command also holds all carriers to certain on-time performance requirements. To the extent that we fail to meet those performance requirements or if we fail to perform or to pass semi-annual AMC inspections, our revenues from our AMC Charter business could decline through a suspension or termination of our AMC contract. Our revenues could also decline due to a reduction in the revenue rate we are paid by the Air Mobility Command, a greater reliance by the AMC on its own freighter fleet or a reduction in our allocation of expansion flying. If our AMC Charter business declines significantly and we are otherwise unable to effectively deploy the resultant capacity, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our AMC Charter business is dependent on our participation in a team accredited to participate in the CRAF program. If one of our team members withdraws from the program, or if other carriers commit additional aircraft to this program, our share of AMC flying may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Each year, the Air Mobility Command allocates its air cargo capacity needs to different teams of airlines based on a point system that is determined by the amount and types of aircraft such team of airlines pledges to the CRAF program. We participate in the CRAF program through a teaming arrangement with other airlines, led by FedEx. Our team is one of three major teams participating in the CRAF program. Several factors could adversely affect the amount of AMC flying that is allocated to us, including:  the formation of competing teaming arrangements;  an increase by other air carriers in their commitment of aircraft to the CRAF program;  the withdrawal of our teams current partners, especially FedEx;  a reduction of the number of aircraft pledged to the CRAF program by us or other members of our team; or  increased participation of other carriers in the CRAF program. A reduction in our share of AMC flying could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 15 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Scheduled Service Business and the DHL Transaction Operating results in our Scheduled Service business may vary significantly from period to period until the commencement of the blocked space agreement with DHL. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, approximately 42.1%, 41.4% and 34.4% of our operating revenues were derived from our Scheduled Service business. Our Scheduled Service business operates according to fixed flight schedules regardless of the amount of cargo transported. Consequently, a significant portion of our Scheduled Service costs are fixed, such as crew, fuel, capital costs, maintenance, and facilities expenses. The contribution generated from our Scheduled Services business varies significantly from period to period depending on a number of factors outside of our control, including global airfreight demand, global economic conditions, competition and increases in fuel costs. Our agreements with DHL require us to meet certain performance targets in our Scheduled Service operations, including certain departure/arrival reliability standards. Failure to meet these performance targets could adversely affect our financial results. Our ability to derive the expected economic benefits from our transactions with DHL depends substantially on our ability to successfully meet strict performance standards and deadlines for aircraft and ground operations. As an express network provider, we will be required to operate under these tighter time schedules by the BSA Commencement Date. If we do not meet these requirements, we may not be able to achieve the projected revenues and profitability from this contract, and we could be exposed to certain DHL remedies, including termination of the arrangements in the most extreme of circumstances, as described below. Our blocked space agreement with DHL confers certain termination rights to DHL which, if exercised or triggered, may result in us being unable to realize the full benefits of this transaction. Our blocked space agreement with DHL gives DHL the option to terminate the agreement for convenience by giving notice to us at least one year prior to the fifth, tenth or fifteenth anniversary of the agreements commencement date. If DHL terminates for convenience on the fifth anniversary, Polar or DHL will be required to assume all six Boeing 747-400 freighter head leases for the entire remaining term of each such aircraft lease. Each assumed lease has a guarantee by DHLs parent or its creditworthy subsidiary. Further, DHL has a right to terminate the blocked space agreement for cause following a specified management resolution process in the event that we default on our performance or we are unable to perform for reasons beyond our control. If DHL exercises any of these termination rights, we will not be able to achieve the projected revenues and profitability from this contract. Risks Related to Our Business Generally Should any of our existing aircraft or our new order of Boeing 747-8F aircraft become underutilized by our businesses, failure to re-deploy these aircraft at favorable rates in our other lines of business or to successfully and timely dispose of such aircraft could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We provisionally allocate our existing and on-order aircraft among our business segments according to projected demand. If demand in our ACMI or AMC Charter businesses weakens and as a result we have underutilized aircraft, we will seek to re-deploy these aircraft in our other lines of business. If we are unable to successfully deploy our existing aircraft or our new order of Boeing 747-8F aircraft, when delivered, at favorable rates or achieve a timely disposal of such aircraft, our long term results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 16 Table of Contents While our revenues may vary significantly over time, a substantial portion of our operating expenses are fixed. These fixed costs limit our ability to quickly change our cost structure to respond to any declines in our revenues, which could reduce our profitability. To maintain our level of operations, a substantial portion of our costs, such as aircraft ownership, crew maintenance and facility costs, are fixed. Operating revenues from our business are directly affected by our ability to maintain high utilization of our aircraft and services at favorable rates. The utilization of our aircraft and our ability to obtain favorable rates are affected by many factors, including global demand for airfreight, global economic conditions, fuel costs and the deployment by our current and potential customers of their own aircraft, among others, which may cause our revenues to vary significantly over time. If our revenues for a particular period fall below expectations, we would be unable to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that period. Any revenue shortfall during a quarterly or annual period may cause our profitability for that period to fall. We have a limited number of revenue producing assets. The loss of one or more of our aircraft for an extended period of time could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our operating revenues depend on our ability to effectively deploy all the aircraft in our fleet and maintain high utilization of these aircraft at favorable rates. In the event that one or more of our aircraft are out of service for an extended period of time, our operating revenues will significantly decrease and we may have difficulty fulfilling our obligations under one or more of our existing contracts. The loss of revenue resulting from any such business interruption, and the cost, long lead time and difficulties in sourcing a replacement aircraft, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have a number of contractual obligations, including progress payments, associated with our order of 12 Boeing 747-8F aircraft. If we are unable to obtain financing for these aircraft and/or make the required progress payments, our growth strategy will be disrupted and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In September 2006, we placed an order for 12 new Boeing 747-8F aircraft that are scheduled to be delivered in 2010 and 2011. As part of this transaction, we also hold rights to purchase up to an additional 14 Boeing 747-8F aircraft. We are required to pay significant pre-delivery deposits to Boeing for these aircraft. As of December 31, 2007, we had commitments of approximately $2.1 billion associated with this aircraft order (including estimated contractual escalations and applying purchase credits). We typically finance our aircraft through either mortgage debt or lease financing. Although we have received standby financing commitments to finance four of these aircraft, we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the financing conditions contained in these commitments or to secure other financing on terms attractive to us or at all. If we are unable to secure financing on acceptable terms, including financing of our progress payments, we may be required to incur financing costs that are substantially higher than what we currently anticipate. Our substantial lease and debt obligations, including aircraft lease and other obligations, could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or capital requirements, all of which could limit our financial resources and ability to compete, and may make us more vulnerable to adverse economic events. As of December 31, 2007, we had total debt obligations of approximately $469.6 million and total aircraft operating leases and other lease obligations of $2,203.2 million. These obligations are expected to increase significantly over the next several years as we begin to accept delivery of, and enter into financing arrangements for, our new Boeing 747-8F aircraft. Our outstanding financial obligations could have negative consequences, including:  making it more difficult to pay principal and interest with respect to our debt and lease obligations; 17 Table of Contents  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for interest, principal and lease payments and reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital and other general corporate requirements;  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in business and in our industry. Our ability to service our debt and meet our lease and other obligations as they come due is dependent on our future financial and operating performance. This performance is subject to various factors, including factors beyond our control, such as changes in global and regional economic conditions, changes in our industry, changes in interest or currency exchange rates, the price and availability of aviation fuel and other costs, including labor and insurance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet our debt service, lease and other obligations as they become due. Certain of our debt and lease obligations contain a number of restrictive covenants. In addition, many of our debt and lease obligations have cross default and cross acceleration provisions. Restrictive covenants in certain of our debt and lease obligations, under certain circumstances, could impact our ability to:  pay dividends or repurchase stock;  consolidate or merge with or into other companies or sell substantially all of our assets; and/or  expand in a material way into lines of businesses beyond existing business activities or those which are cargo-related and/or aviation-related and similar businesses. In certain circumstances, a covenant default under one of our debt instruments could cause us to be in default of other obligations as well. Any unremedied defaults could lead to an acceleration of the amounts owed, and potentially could cause us to lose possession or control of certain aircraft. Fuel price volatility could adversely affect our business and operations, especially in our Scheduled Service and Commercial Charter businesses. The price of aircraft fuel is unpredictable and has been increasingly volatile over the past few years. Fuel is one of the most significant expenses in our Scheduled Service and Commercial Charter businesses. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, fuel costs were approximately 37.8%, 34.3% and 30.0%, respectively, of our total operating expenses. Although we attempt to pass on increases in the price of aircraft fuel to our Scheduled Service and Commercial Charter customers by imposing a company determined surcharge, we ultimately bear a portion of any price increases. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to impose such surcharges in the future. In addition, while our ACMI contracts require our customers to pay for aviation fuel, if fuel costs increase significantly, their customers may reduce the volume and frequency of cargo shipments or find less costly alternatives for cargo delivery, such as land and sea carriers. Our financial condition could suffer if we experience unanticipated costs or enforcement action as a result of the Department of Justice fuel surcharge investigation and other lawsuits and claims. On February 14, 2006, the Department of Justice served us with a subpoena in connection with its investigation into the fuel surcharge pricing practices of approximately 20 air cargo carriers. Other than the subpoena, there has been no formal complaint or demand of us by the Department of Justice, and we are fully cooperating with this investigation. As a result of the investigation, we and a number of other cargo carriers have been named co-defendants in a number of class action suits filed in multiple jurisdictions of the U.S. Federal District Court, and have been named in two civil class action suits in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, Canada, which are substantially similar to the U.S. class action suits. Moreover, we have submitted relevant information and documentation to regulators in Australia and New Zealand in connection with 18 Table of Contents investigations initiated by such authorities into pricing practices of certain international air cargo carriers. We have also received notification from authorities in Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand and the EU that they are investigating the freight pricing practices of several carriers, including us. We are also party to a number of other claims, lawsuits and pending actions, which we consider to be routine and incidental to our business (see Note 12 to our Financial Statements). We are party to collective bargaining agreements with our U.S. crewmembers that could result in higher labor costs than those faced by some of our non-unionized competitors, putting us at a competitive disadvantage, and could result in a work interruption or stoppage, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have two separate crewmember forces, one for each of Atlas and Polar. Each is represented by ALPA, except for a limited number of crewmembers (approximately 60 in total) who are employed by AABO in Stansted, England. There is a separate collective bargaining agreement at each of Atlas and Polar. Collectively, these employees represented approximately 49.9%, 50.5% and 49.0% of our workforce at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We are subject to risks of increased labor costs associated with having a partially unionized workforce, as well as a greater risk of work interruption or stoppage. We cannot assure you that disputes, including disputes with certified collective bargaining representatives of our employees, will not arise in the future or will result in an agreement on terms satisfactory to us. Such disputes and the inherent costs associated with their resolution could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Exposure Draft of the AICPA Industry Audit Guide Audits and Accounting Guide-Airlines proposes changes to accounting requirements that may, when released in final form, cause us to revisit our accounting for prepaid maintenance. The Exposure Draft of the AICPA Industry Audit Guide entitled Audits and Accounting Guide-Airlines proposes guidance on accounting requirements relating to, among other matters, accounting for prepaid maintenance. We believe that our accounting treatment with respect to prepaid maintenance is in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, if the guidance with respect to prepaid maintenance expense is unchanged upon issuance of the final guide, the SEC may disagree with the accounting treatment of our current maintenance arrangements. In such event, and if our maintenance arrangements remain the same as currently in effect and we are unable to convince the SEC that our accounting is in accordance with GAAP, we may be required to revise disclosures in future filings, amend disclosures in our previous Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and subsequent periodic reports, or depending on the transition guidance, if any, related to the adoption of the new guide, restate prior period financial statements. As a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement and other rules and regulations that add costs to our business. A violation of these rules and regulations could lead to termination or suspension of our government contracts and could prevent us from entering into contracts with government agencies in the future. In order to do business with government agencies, including the AMC, we must comply with, and are affected by, many laws and regulations, including those related to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. These laws and regulations, among other things:  require, in some cases, procurement with small businesses certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations, and may give rise to U.S. government audit rights;  impose accounting rules that dictate how we define certain accounts, define allowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. government contracts;  establish specific health, safety and doing-business standards; and  restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data. 19 Table of Contents These laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of these laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts. In addition, the violation of certain other generally applicable laws and regulations could result in our suspension or debarment as a government contractor. Our insurance coverage may become more expensive and difficult to obtain and may not be adequate to insure all risks. Aviation insurance premiums historically have fluctuated based on factors that include the loss history of the industry in general, and the insured carrier in particular. Future terrorist attacks and other adverse events involving aircraft could result in increases in insurance costs and could affect the price and availability of such coverage. We have, as have most other U.S. airlines, purchased our war-risk coverage through a special program administered by the federal government. The FAA is currently providing war-risk hull and cargo loss, crew and third-party liability insurance through March 30, 2008. With the approval of the President, the Secretary of Transportation is empowered to extend coverage through December 31, 2008. However, the FAA has indicated that it intends to gradually withdraw war-risk coverage for all U.S. airlines in upcoming renewal periods to allow for an orderly transition back to commercial markets. If the federal war-risk coverage program terminates or provides significantly less coverage in the future, we could face a material increase in the cost of war-risk coverage, and because of competitive pressures in the industry, our ability to pass this additional cost on to customers may be limited. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing coverage on terms favorable to us, that the premiums for such coverage will not increase substantially or that we will not bear substantial losses and lost revenues from accidents or other adverse events. Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of related insurance coverage or a significant increase in our current insurance expense could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, while we carry insurance against the risks inherent to our operations, which we believe are consistent with the insurance arrangements of other participants in our industry, we cannot assure you that we are adequately insured against all risks. If our liability exceeds the amounts of our insurance coverage, we would be required to pay the excess amount, which could be material to our business and operations. Some of our aircraft are periodically deployed in potentially dangerous situations, which may result in damaged to our aircraft. Some of our aircraft are deployed in potentially dangerous locations and carry hazardous cargo incidental to the services we provide in support of U.S. military activities, particularly in shipments to the Middle East. Some areas through which our flight routes pass are subject to geopolitical instability, which increases the risk of a loss of, or damage to, our aircraft, or death or injury to our personnel. While we maintain insurance to cover the loss of an aircraft, except for limited situations, we do not have insurance against the loss arising from business interruption. It is difficult to replace lost or substantially damaged aircraft due to the high capital requirements and long delivery lead times for new aircraft or to locate appropriate in-service aircraft for lease or sale. Global trade flows are seasonal; hence all of our business segments, including our ACMI customers business, experience seasonal revenue variation. Global trade flows are seasonal in nature, with peak activity occurring during the retail holiday season, which traditionally begins in September and lasts through mid-December. This typically results in a significant decline in demand for these services in the first quarter of the year. Additionally, while our ACMI contracts have contractual utilization minimums, they typically allow our customers to cancel an agreed upon percentage of the guaranteed hours of aircraft utilization over the course of a year. Our customers often exercise those cancellation options early in the first quarter of the year, when the demand for air cargo capacity has been historically low following the seasonal holiday peak in the fourth quarter. While our revenues fluctuate seasonally as described above, a significant proportion of the costs associated with our business, such as 20 Table of Contents aircraft rent, depreciation and facilities costs, are fixed and cannot easily be reduced to match the seasonal drop in demand. As a result, our net operating results are subject to a high degree of seasonality. Volatility in international currency markets may adversely affect demand for our services. Although we price the majority of our services and receive the majority of our payments in U.S. dollars, many of our customers revenues are denominated in foreign currencies. Any significant devaluation in such currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on such customers ability to pay us or on their level of demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If there is a continued significant decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, the demand for some of the products that we transport could decline. Such a decline could reduce demand for our services and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We rely on third party service providers. If these service providers do not deliver the high level of service and support required in our business, we may lose customers and revenue. We rely on third parties to provide certain essential services on our behalf, including maintenance and ground handling. In certain locations, there may be very few sources, or sometimes only a single source, of supply for these services. If we are unable to effectively manage these third parties, they may provide inadequate levels of support which could have an adverse impact on our operations and the results thereof. Any material problems with the efficiency and timeliness of our contracted services, or an unexpected termination of those services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY We depend on certain levels of worldwide economic activity to operate our business successfully. Any significant decrease in demand for air cargo transport could adversely affect our business and operations. Our success is highly dependent upon the level of business activity and overall global economic conditions, including import and export demand in our key markets, and levels of international U.S. military activity. Any economic downturn in the U.S. or in our key markets overseas, or any business shift towards using less time sensitive modes of freight transportation, such as land or sea based cargo services, is likely to adversely affect demand for our services and the services offered by our ACMI customers. Additionally, a prolonged economic slowdown may increase the likelihood that our customers would reduce the scope of services we provide to them which could adversely affect our business and operations. The market for air cargo services is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose current customers or fail to attract new customers. Each of the markets we participate in is highly competitive and fragmented. We offer a broad range of aviation services and our competitors vary by geographic market and type of service and include other international and domestic contract carriers, regional and national ground handling and logistics companies, internal cargo units of major airlines and third party cargo providers. Competition in the air cargo and transportation market is influenced by several key factors, including quality, price and availability of assets and services. Regulatory requirements to operate in the U.S. domestic air cargo market have been reduced, facilitating the entry into domestic markets by foreign air cargo companies. In addition, we expect that new freighter aircraft, including passenger aircraft that have been converted into freighter aircraft that enter the market, are likely to add to the supply of available cargo aircraft. 21 Table of Contents We are subject to extensive governmental regulations and our failure to comply with these regulations in the U.S. and abroad, or the adoption of any new laws, policies or regulations or changes to such regulations may have an adverse effect on our business. Our operations are subject to complex aviation and transportation laws and regulations, including Title 49 of the U.S. Code (formerly the Federal Aviation Act 1958, as amended), under which the DOT and the FAA exercise regulatory authority over air carriers. In addition, our business activities fall within the jurisdiction of various other federal, state, local and foreign authorities, including the U.S. Department of Defense, the TSA, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control and the EPA. In addition, other countries in which we operate have similar regulatory regimes to which we are subjected. These laws and regulations may require us to maintain and comply with the terms of a wide variety of certificates, permits, licenses, noise abatement standards and other requirements and our failure to do so could result in substantial fines or other sanctions. These U.S. and foreign aviation regulatory agencies have the authority to modify, amend, suspend or revoke the authority and licenses issued to us for failure to comply with provisions of law or applicable regulations and may impose civil or criminal penalties for violations of applicable rules and regulations. Such fines or sanctions, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our mode of conducting business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, U.S. and foreign governmental authorities may adopt new regulations, directives or orders that could require us to take additional and potentially costly compliance steps or result in the grounding of some of our aircraft, which could increase our operating costs or result in a loss of revenues. International aviation is increasingly subject to conflicting requirements imposed or proposed by the U.S. and foreign governments. This is especially true in the areas of transportation security, aircraft noise and emissions control. The imposition of potential new restrictions in the environmental area, to control greenhouse gas emissions, is a distinct possibility. Such restrictions may have an adverse impact on our industry. Finalization of European Union legislations to limit the ability of European Union carriers to wet lease (through ACMI arrangements) aircraft from non-European Union carriers also could have an adverse impact. These and other similar regulatory developments could increase business uncertainty for commercial air-freight carriers. The airline industry is subject to numerous security regulations and rules which increase costs. Imposition of more stringent regulations and rules than currently exist could materially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The TSA has increased security requirements in response to increased levels of terrorist activity, and has adopted comprehensive new regulations governing air cargo transportation, including all-cargo services, in such areas as cargo screening and security clearances for individuals with access to cargo. Additional measures, including a requirement to screen cargo, have been proposed, which if adopted, may have an adverse impact on our ability to efficiently process cargo and would increase our costs. The cost of compliance with increasingly stringent regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK The sale of shares by our principal stockholders could affect the price of our common stock. HMC Atlas Air, L.L.C. and Harbinger Capital Partners Special Situations Fund, L.P. (our principal stockholders) collectively own approximately 8,389,690 shares or 38.8%, of our common stock as of December 31, 2007. On April 16, 2007, we filed a shelf registration with the SEC on behalf of our principal stockholders covering all of the common shares owned by these entities. We may also be required to file up to two additional registration statements on behalf of our principal stockholders in certain circumstances. Our principal stockholders also have piggyback registration rights in connection with certain offerings of our common stock. Filing additional shelf registration statements for our principal stockholders could have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock due to the large number of shares required to be registered and the possible sale of these shares over the period of effectiveness of the registration statement up to a three-year period. 22 Table of Contents The concentration of our capital stock ownership could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and make it more difficult for you to elect directors of your choosing. Our principal stockholders beneficially own shares of our common stock, representing 38.8% of the voting power of our common stock. This concentration likely will limit other stockholders ability to influence corporate matters. If our principal stockholders were to act in concert with any of our other major stockholders, such holders could be in a position to control the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, such as an amendment to our certificate of incorporation, the authorization of additional shares of capital stock, and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and could prevent or cause a change in control of us. Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock. Provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control, which stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of common stock. These provisions include the following:  the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of, and issue new series of, preferred stock without stockholder approval;  the ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our by-laws;  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings of stockholders; and  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations. Except for the provision dealing with the issuance of new series of preferred stock, the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote is necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions. In addition, absent approval of our board of directors, our by-laws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of our shares entitled to vote. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly-traded Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years had owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The existence of the above provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of us, thereby reducing the likelihood that a shareholder could receive a premium for owned common stock in an acquisition. Our common stock share price has been subject to fluctuation in value. The trading price of our common shares is subject to material fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including quarterly variations in our operating results, economic conditions of the airline industry generally or airline cargo carriers specifically, general economic conditions or other events and factors that are beyond our control. In the past, following periods of significant volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a companys securities, securities class action litigation has been instituted against these companies in some circumstances. If this type of litigation were instituted against us following a period of volatility in the market price for our common stock, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.
