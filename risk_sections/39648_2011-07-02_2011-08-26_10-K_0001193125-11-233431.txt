ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The statements in this section, as well as statements described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or in other SEC filings, describe risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our securities. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could also be materially affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. In addition, this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as estimates, anticipates, projects, plans, expects, intends, believes, seeks, could, should, may and will or the negative versions thereof and similar expressions and by the context in which they are used. Such statements are based upon our current expectations and speak only as of the date made. These statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs, lower sales volumes, the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions or assumption of unknown liabilities in connection with acquisitions, fluctuations in costs of materials and labor, costs and possible effects of union organizing activities, loss of key management, uncertainties regarding any existing or newly-discovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation, failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the initiation or outcome of litigation or governmental investigation, higher than assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products, the disruption of operations from catastrophic events, disruptions in capital markets, the liquidity of counterparties in financial transactions, changes in federal and state tax laws, economic uncertainties and the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which they are made except as required by law. Also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions relevant to our business. Actual results may differ from certain assumptions we have made causing actual events to vary from expected results. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. General economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance. Continued high levels of unemployment, inflation, tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for our products and services. Increases in labor costs, including healthcare and insurance costs, higher material costs for items, such as linens and textiles, higher fuel and other energy costs, higher interest rates, inflation, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental and direct sales and selling and administrative expenses and could adversely affect our operating results. Increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance. We operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national, regional and local providers. Service, product, design, price, quality, and convenience to the customer are the 6 Table of Contents primary competitive elements in these industries. If existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices, we may be required to lower prices, which could be detrimental to our operating results. Our competitors also generally compete with us for acquisition candidates, which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates. In addition, our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services in-house instead of outsourcing such services. These competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and operating results. Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced, and the cost of those products, could adversely affect our operating results. The products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of these products is an important factor in our financial performance. We endeavor that all of our suppliers comply with applicable laws, including, without limitation, labor and environmental laws. Our ability to secure and maintain qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner can be a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the United States. Political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial stability of suppliers, failure to meet our supplier standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, United States and Canadian foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our operating results. Failure to comply with the regulations of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other state and local agencies that oversee safety compliance could adversely affect our results of operations. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, or OSHA, establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by OSHA and various record keeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Various OSHA standards apply to our operations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with OSHA and other state and local laws and regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines by government authorities and payment of damages to private litigants and affect our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our results of operations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our operating results. Our operating locations are subject to stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing the potential discharges of pollutants to the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. The operation of our business entails risks under environmental laws and regulations. We could incur significant costs, including, without limitation, clean-up costs, fines, sanctions and claims by regulators or third parties for property damage and personal injury, as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws and regulations. As a result of violations of these laws and regulations, among other things, we could be required to reduce or cease use of certain equipment and/or limit or stop production at certain facilities. These consequences could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition and disrupt customer relationships. We are currently involved in a limited number of legal matters and remedial investigations and 7 Table of Contents actions at various locations related to environmental laws and regulations. While it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to contingent liabilities, including lawsuits, legal matters, claims and environmental contingencies, based on information currently available and our assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, we believe that the cost of these environmental-related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. It is possible, however, that our future financial position or results of operations for any particular future period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies, the imposition of clean-up obligations, and the discovery of alleged contamination or changes out of our control. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Under environmental laws, an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property, whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials. While we regularly engage in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions, we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to regulator or third-party actions, including tort suits. Additionally, we must maintain compliance with various permits and licenses issued to us in connection with our operations, or we must apply for and obtain such permits and licenses. Any failure on our part to maintain such compliance or to apply for and receive such permits and licenses could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at a particular location. At each reporting period, we assess our operations to determine whether the costs of resolution of legal matters or of investigation and remediation of environmental conditions are probable and can be reasonably estimated, as well as the adequacy of our reserves with respect to such costs. At July 2, 2011, our reserves for environmental matters were approximately $1.4 million. We cannot guarantee that our reserves with respect to environmental matters will be sufficient or that the costs of resolution of legal matters or of remediation and investigation will not substantially exceed our reserves as new facts, circumstance or estimates arise. Fluctuations in demand for our products and services may harm our financial results. Current uncertainty in global economic conditions poses a risk to the overall economy as consumers and businesses may defer purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news. This could negatively impact our customers and consequently have a negative impact on our financial performance. If demand for our products and services fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, our revenue and operating margin could be negatively impacted. Important factors that could cause demand for our products and services to fluctuate include:  changes in business and economic conditions, including further downturns in specific industry segments and/or the overall economy;  changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market, expectations for inflation, and energy prices;  competitive pressures, including pricing pressures, from companies that have competing products and services;  changes in customer needs;  changes in our customers employment levels, which impacts the number of users of our products and services;  strategic actions taken by our competitors; and  market acceptance of our products and services. 8 Table of Contents If our customers demand for our products and services decreases, our plant and manufacturing capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to record an impairment of our long-lived assets, including facilities and equipment, as well as intangible assets, which would increase our expenses. A change in demand for our products and services, and changes in our customers needs, could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results, and, in certain cases, may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us to recognize impairments of our assets. Legal proceedings may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. From time to time we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings. Certain of these proceedings or potential future proceedings, if decided adversely against us or settled by us, may result in a liability that is material to our financial condition and operating results. We discuss current lawsuits and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail within Item 3. Legal Proceedings, Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Environmental Matters and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Note 12 entitled Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Risks associated with our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our operating results. Historically, a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions. We continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and purchase suitable operations. In addition, the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired business. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managements attention and our financial and other resources. Although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will discover all operational deficiencies or material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator. The failure to successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover such liabilities could adversely affect our operating results. Increases in fuel, energy and commodity costs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Gasoline, diesel, natural gas, electricity, cotton and commodity purchases represent a significant cost within our business. The price of these commodities, which are required to run our vehicles and equipment and manufacture our garments, can be unpredictable and can fluctuate based on events beyond our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war, terrorism and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns, limits on refining capacities, natural disasters and environmental concerns. Increases in the cost of these commodities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Failure to preserve positive labor relationships could adversely impact our operations and financial results. Significant portions of our Canadian labor force are unionized, and a lesser portion of United States employees are unionized. Competitors within our industry have been the target of unionization campaigns. While we believe that our Canadian and U.S. employee relations are satisfactory, we could experience pressure from labor unions similar to those faced by our competitors. If we do encounter pressure from labor unions, any resulting labor unrest could disrupt our business by impairing our ability to produce and deliver our products and services. In addition, significant union representation would require us to negotiate with many of our employees collectively and could adversely affect our results by restricting our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations. 9 Table of Contents Inability to attract and retain employees could adversely impact our operations. Our ability to attract and retain employees is important to our operations. Our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. In the event of a labor shortage, or in the event of a change in prevailing labor and/or immigration laws, we could experience difficulty in delivering our services in a high-quality or timely manner and we could be forced to increase wages in order to attract and retain employees, which would result in higher operating costs. Loss of our key management or other personnel could adversely impact our business. Our success is dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management and other key personnel. If, for any reason, one or more senior executives or key personnel were not to remain active in our company, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results. Unexpected events, including, without limitation, fires at facilities, natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tornados, public health emergencies, war or terrorist activities, unplanned utility outages, supply disruptions, failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws and/or regulations impacting our business, could adversely affect our operating results. These events could result in disruption of customer service, physical damage or temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities, or the temporary disruption of information systems. Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. While we continue to evaluate our internal controls, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud. This may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. Failure to execute our business plan could adversely affect our business and stock price. Successful execution of our business plan is not assured as there are several obstacles to success, including a continued difficult economic environment and a competitive industry. In addition, there can be no assurance that our efforts, if properly executed, will result in our desired outcome of improved financial performance. The financial condition of multi-employer union pension plans that we participate in may have a material adverse affect on our financial performance. We participate in a number of union sponsored, collectively bargained multi-employer pension plans (MEPPs). We are responsible for our proportional share of any unfunded vested benefits related to the MEPPs. The funded status of these various plans has substantially deteriorated in the recent past. In the future, if local union employees vote to decertify their respective union, otherwise withdraw from the plan, or if other participants in the plan experience financial difficulty, including bankruptcy, it could trigger a liability or increase our liability under the associated MEPP, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance and could be greater than estimated. We do not have the ability to predict or influence the timing of the votes to decertify a union. 10 Table of Contents Fluctuations in Canadian, Dominican Republic and Ireland currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Certain of our foreign revenues and operating expenses are transacted in local currencies. Therefore, our results of operations and certain receivables and payables are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Risks associated with potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets could adversely affect our financial performance. In fiscal year 2009, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $107.0 million, which reduced the carrying value of our goodwill to $319.9 million as of June 27, 2009. We continue to monitor relevant circumstances, including customer spending levels, general economic conditions and the market price for our common stock, and the potential impact that such circumstances might have on the valuation of our goodwill. It is possible that changes in such circumstances, or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made by us in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, could require us to further reduce our goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges. If we were required to further reduce our goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected. Access to the capital markets, including bank financing, could be restricted and impact the liquidity needed to run the business. Although we believe that we will be able to maintain sufficient access to the capital markets, changes in current market conditions, deterioration in our business performance, or adverse changes in the economy could limit our access to these markets. Global financial markets have experienced disruptions in the past, including, among other things, volatility in security prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades and declining valuations of certain investments. There can be no assurance that the global financial markets will not experience disruptions in the future, or that future disruptions may be more severe than those previously experienced. These disruptions could lead to challenges in our business and negatively impact our financial results. A tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in orders and spending for our products and services. In addition, changes in the economic environment could adversely impact assumptions we use to value our pension plan assets and obligations which could result in a material adverse impact to our financial results in future periods.
