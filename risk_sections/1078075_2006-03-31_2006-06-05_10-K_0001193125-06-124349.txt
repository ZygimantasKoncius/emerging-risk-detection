Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition to the other information in this report, the following discussion should be considered carefully in evaluating NetScout and our business. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and are identified by terminology such as may, will, could, should, expects, plans, intends, seeks, anticipates, believes, estimates, potential or continue, or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Actual events or results may differ materially. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. Our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors. Except for the historical information in this report, the matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. The following factors are among many that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in or implied by forward-looking statements made in this report. These statements involve the risks and uncertainties identified below as well as additional risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are immaterial may also impact our business operations. Such factors are among many that may have a material adverse impact upon our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate. Our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Most of our expenses, such as employee compensation and rent, are relatively fixed in the short term. Moreover, our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future revenue levels. As a result, if revenue for a particular quarter is below our expectations, we may not be able to reduce operating expenses proportionately for that quarter, and, therefore, this revenue shortfall would have a disproportionately negative impact on our operating results for that quarter. Our quarterly revenue may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including the following:  technology spending by current and potential customers;  uneven demand for application and network management solutions;  the timing and receipt of orders from customers, especially in light of our lengthy sales cycle;  the timing and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors; 14  changes in the distribution channels through which our products are sold;  the timing of hiring sales personnel and the speed at which such personnel become productive;  our ability to anticipate or adapt effectively to developing markets and rapidly changing technologies;  changes in the number and size of our competitors;  changes in our prices or the prices of our competitors products; and  economic slowdowns or the occurrence of unforeseeable events, such as terrorist attacks, which contribute to such slowdowns. We operate with minimal backlog because our products typically are shipped shortly after orders are received. As a result, product revenue in any quarter is substantially dependent upon orders booked and shipped in that quarter and revenue for any future quarter is not predictable to any degree of certainty. Achieving all or more of our projected sales during a quarter is critical to our achievement of expected financial results and any significant deferral of orders for our products would cause a shortfall in revenue for that quarter. If we fail to introduce new products and enhance our existing products to keep up with rapid technological change, demand for our products may decline. The market for application and network management solutions is characterized by rapid changes in technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent product introductions and enhancements. Our success is dependent upon our ability to meet our customers needs, which are driven by changes in computer networking technologies and the emergence of new industry standards. In addition, new technologies may shorten the life cycle for our products or could render our existing or planned products obsolete. If we are unable to develop and introduce new network and application infrastructure performance management products or enhancements to existing products in a timely and successful manner, this inability could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. We have introduced and intend to continue to introduce new products related to our previously announced CDM, High Definition and Application Fabric Performance Management technology strategies. If the introduction of these products is significantly delayed or if we are unsuccessful in selling these products to our current and potential customers, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted. If our products contain errors, they may be costly to correct, revenue may be delayed, we could be sued and our reputation could be harmed. Despite testing by our customers and us, errors may be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments. If errors are discovered, we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or at all. In addition, we may need to make significant expenditures of capital resources in order to eliminate errors and failures. Errors and failures in our products could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation. If one or more of our products fail, a customer may assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us. The occurrence or discovery of these types of errors or failures could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. We face significant competition from other technology companies. The market for application and network management solutions is intensely competitive. We believe customers make network management system purchasing decisions based primarily upon the following factors:  product performance, functionality and price;  name and reputation of vendor; 15  distribution strength; and  alliances with industry partners. We compete with the smaller yet growing number of providers of application and network performance management solutions and providers of portable network traffic analyzers and probes, such as Network General (formerly a division of Network Associates, Inc.). In addition, leading network equipment providers, including Cisco, offer their own solutions, including products which they license from other competitors. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, management, marketing, service, support, technical, distribution and other resources than we do. Further, in recent years some of our competitors have been acquired by larger companies that are seeking to enter or expand in the markets that we operate. Therefore, given their larger size and greater resources our competitors may be able to respond more effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. As a result of these and other factors, we may not be able to compete effectively with our current or future competitors, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. The success of our business depends on the continued growth in the market for and the commercial acceptance of application and network management solutions. We derive all of our revenue from the sale of products and services that are designed to allow our customers to manage the performance of applications across computer networks. Therefore, we must be able to predict the appropriate features and prices for future products to address the market, the optimal distribution strategy and the future changes to the competitive environment. In order for us to be successful, our potential customers must recognize the value of more sophisticated application and network management solutions, decide to invest in the management of their networked applications and, in particular, adopt our management solutions. Any failure of this market to continue to be viable would materially and adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, businesses may choose to outsource the management of their networks to service providers. Our business may depend on our ability to continue to develop relationships with these service providers and successfully market our products to them. The current economic and geopolitical environment may impact some specific sectors into which we sell. Many of our customers are concentrated in a small number of sectors, including financial services, government, health and medical, and telecommunications. Certain sectors may be more acutely affected by economic, geopolitical and other factors than other sectors. To the extent that one or more of the sectors in which our customer base operates are adversely impacted, whether as a result of general conditions affecting all sectors or as a result of conditions affecting only those particular sectors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. Our success depends on our ability to expand and manage our international operations. Sales to customers outside North America accounted for 20%, 18% and 19% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We currently expect international revenue to continue to account for a significant percentage of total revenue in the future. We believe that we must continue to expand our international sales activities in order to be successful. Our international sales growth will be limited if we are unable to:  expand international indirect distribution channels;  hire additional sales personnel;  adapt products for local markets and to comply with foreign regulations. For example, in July 2006, the European Union will implement its new Directive on the Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances (RoHS), that is designed to restrict the use of cadmium, hexavalent chromium, lead, mercury and certain halogenated flame retardants (PBBs and PBDEs) in electronic products; and  manage geographically dispersed operations. 16 The major countries outside of North America in which we do or intend to do business are England, Germany, Japan and China. Our international operations, including our operations in England, Germany, Japan and China, are generally subject to a number of risks, including:  failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection that the laws in the United States provide against infringement of our intellectual property;  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors;  dependence on local indirect channel partners;  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;  longer sales cycles;  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; and  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and political and economic instability. Our success depends on our ability to manage indirect distribution channels. Sales to our indirect distribution channels, which include original equipment manufacturers, distributors, resellers, systems integrators and service providers, accounted for 61%, 55% and 50% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. To increase our sales going forward we need to continue to enhance our indirect sales efforts, to continue to manage and expand these existing indirect distribution channels and to develop new indirect distribution channels. Our indirect channel partners have no obligation to purchase any products from us. In addition, they could internally develop products that compete with our solutions or partner with our competitors or bundle or resell competitors solutions, possibly at lower prices. The potential inability to develop new relationships or to expand and manage our existing relationships with partners, the potential inability or unwillingness of our partners to effectively market and sell our products or the loss of existing partnerships could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our future growth depends on our ability to maintain and periodically expand our sales force. We must maintain and periodically increase the size of our sales force in order to increase our direct sales and support our indirect sales channels. Because our products are very technical, sales people require a comparatively long period of time to become productive, typically three to twelve months. This lag in productivity, as well as the challenge of attracting qualified candidates, may make it difficult to meet our sales force growth targets. Further, we may not generate sufficient sales to offset the increased expense resulting from growing our sales force. If we are unable successfully to maintain and periodically expand our sales capability, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted. We must hire and retain skilled personnel. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled employees, particularly sales and marketing personnel, software engineers, and technical support personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain the highly skilled technical personnel that are integral to our sales, marketing, product development and technical support teams, the rate at which we can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements may be limited. This inability could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business. Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of Anil Singhal, our President, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, and Narendra Popat, our Chairman of the Board and co-founder. We also depend on the ability of our other executive officers and senior managers to work effectively as a team. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our reliance on sole source suppliers could adversely impact our business. Many components that are necessary for the assembly of our probes are obtained from separate sole source suppliers or a limited group of suppliers. These components include some of our network interface cards. Our reliance on sole or limited 17 suppliers involves several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and the inability to influence appropriate control over pricing, quality and timely delivery of components. We do not generally maintain long-term agreements with any of our suppliers or have on hand large volumes of inventory. Our inability to obtain adequate deliveries or the occurrence of any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of these components would impact our ability to ship our products on a timely basis. This could damage relationships with our current and prospective customers, cause shortfalls in expected revenue, and could materially and adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. Our business is heavily dependent on our intellectual property. We rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and registrations and non-disclosure and other contractual and license arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. The reverse engineering, unauthorized copying, or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without compensating us. Legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of uncertainty. In addition, legal proceedings may divert managements attention from growing our business. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information, or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use by third parties and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. Further, we also license software from third parties for use as part of our products, and if any of these licenses were to terminate, we may experience delays in product shipment until we develop or license alternative software. Others may claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights. We may be subject to claims by others that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights, patents, copyrights or trademarks. These claims, whether or not valid, could require us to spend significant sums in litigation, pay damages, delay product shipments, reengineer our products, rename our products and rebuild name recognition or acquire licenses to such third-party intellectual property. We may not be able to secure any required licenses on commercially reasonable terms or secure them at all. We expect that these claims could become more frequent as more companies enter the market for network and application infrastructure performance management solutions. Any of these claims or resulting events could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. We may fail to secure necessary additional financing. We may require significant capital resources to expand our business and remain competitive in the rapidly changing network performance management industry. We may invest in our operations as well as acquire complementary businesses, products or technologies. Our future success may depend in part on our ability to obtain additional financing to support our continued growth and operations. If our existing sources of liquidity are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to raise capital by:  issuing additional common stock or other equity instruments;  issuing debt securities;  obtaining additional lease financings; or  increasing our lines of credit. However, we may not be able to obtain additional capital when we want or need it, and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms. Furthermore, any additional capital may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business, such as financial or operating covenants, or that may result in additional dilution to our stockholders. We may not successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions we do make, which could impair our ability to compete and could harm our operating results. We may need to acquire complementary businesses, products or technologies to remain competitive or expand our business. We actively investigate and 18 evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, products and technologies in the ordinary course of business. We may compete for acquisition opportunities with entities having significantly greater resources than us. As a result, we may not succeed in acquiring some or all businesses, products or technologies that we seek to acquire. Our inability to effectively consummate acquisitions on favorable terms could significantly impact our ability to effectively compete in our targeted markets and could negatively affect our results of operations. Further acquisitions that we do complete could adversely impact our business. The potential adverse consequences from acquisitions, such as Quantiva, include:  the potentially dilutive issuance of common stock or other equity instruments;  the incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets;  the incurrence of significant costs and expenses; or  the potentially dilutive impact on our earnings per share. Acquisition transactions also involve numerous business risks. These risks from acquisitions, such as Quantiva, include:  difficulties in assimilating the acquired operations, technologies, personnel and products;  difficulties in managing geographically dispersed and international operations;  difficulties in assimilating diverse financial reporting and management information systems;  the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns;  the potential disruption of our business; and  the potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors or suppliers. Our estimates and judgments related to critical accounting policies could be inaccurate. We consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, valuation of inventories, valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, capitalized software development costs, purchased software and internal use software, and income taxes to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results. Management makes certain significant accounting judgments and estimates related to these policies. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods if our accounting judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting policies prove to be inaccurate. Failure to manage growth properly and to implement enhanced automated systems could adversely impact our business. The growth in size and complexity of our business and our customer base has been and will continue to be a challenge to our management and operations. To manage further growth effectively, we must integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations. We must also implement a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in order to manage the growth and increasing complexity of our business operations and to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Sarbanes-Oxley. Our ERP selection process is complete and we began implementation efforts in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, with the new ERP system anticipated to be operational during the second half of our fiscal year 2007. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our costs, the quality of our products, the effectiveness of our sales organization and our retention of key personnel, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted. The effectiveness of our disclosure and internal controls may be limited. Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors and intentional misrepresentations. Any system of internal control can only provide reasonable assurance that all control objectives are met. Some of the potential risks involved could include but are not limited to management judgments, simple errors or mistakes, willful misconduct regarding controls or misinterpretation. There is no 19 guarantee that existing controls will prevent or detect all material issues or that existing controls will be effective in future conditions, which could materially and adversely impact our financial results. Under Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with this legislation requires managements attention and resources and will continue to cause us to incur significant expense. Managements assessment of our internal control over financial reporting may identify weaknesses that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. If we determine that we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected or the price of our common stock may decline. Although we determined that the operating effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006 was effective, in future years we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any changes necessary to attain a favorable assessment of our internal control over financial reporting or we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any required improvements. If in future annual reports we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent auditors are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our assessment, the price of our common stock may decline. In order to continue the enhancement of our internal control over financial reporting and to manage the growth and increasing complexity of our business, we are in the process of implementing a new ERP system that is expected to be operational in the second half of fiscal year 2007. If we are unable to implement this system successfully, improvements to our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely impacted and this could have a material and adverse impact on our financial results in the future. The price of our common stock may decrease due to market volatility. The market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and has fluctuated significantly since the initial public offering of our common stock on August 12, 1999. The market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Trading activity of our stock has been thin, in part as a result of officers and directors and affiliates holding a significant percentage of our stock. In addition, the market prices of securities of technology companies have been extremely volatile and have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Also, broad market fluctuations could adversely impact the market price of our common stock, which in turn could cause impairment of goodwill that could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Recently, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have occasionally instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issues that stock. If any of our stockholders brought such a lawsuit against us, even if the lawsuit is without merit, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. The lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments We have no unresolved comments from the SEC.
