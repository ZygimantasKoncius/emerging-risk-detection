Item 10. Additional Information Share Capital Under our articles of incorporation, our authorized capital stock consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of which, as of December 31, 2007 and March 31, 2008, 54,557,500 shares were issued and outstanding and fully paid, and 5,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, of which, as of December 31, 2007 and March 31, 2008, no shares were issued and outstanding and fully paid. One million shares of the blank check preferred stock have been designated Series A Participating Preferred Stock in connection with our adoption of a stockholder rights plan as described below under "Stockholder Rights Plan." All of our shares of stock are in registered form. Common Stock Each outstanding share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding shares of preferred stock, holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive ratably all dividends, if any, declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for dividends. Holders of common stock do not have conversion, redemption or preemptive rights to subscribe to any of our securities. All outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. The rights, preferences and 77 privileges of holders of shares of common stock are subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock which we may issue in the future. There were 500 shares of common stock outstanding on October 7, 2005, the date our company was domesticated in the Republic of The Marshall Islands. On September 18, 2006 we effected an 88,615-for-1 stock split. Blank Check Preferred Stock Under the terms of our articles of incorporation, our board of directors has authority, without any further vote or action by our stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, of which 1,000,000 shares have been designated Series A Participating Preferred Stock in connection with our adoption of a stockholder rights plan as described below under "Stockholder Rights Plan." Our board of directors may issue shares of preferred stock on terms calculated to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or the removal of our management. Stockholder Rights Plan General Each share of our common stock includes a right that entitles the holder to purchase from us a unit consisting of one-thousandth of a share of our Series A participating preferred stock at a purchase price of $25.00 per unit, subject to specified adjustments. The rights are issued pursuant to a rights agreement between us and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as rights agent. Until a right is exercised, the holder of a right will have no rights to vote or receive dividends or any other stockholder rights. The rights may have anti-takeover effects. The rights will cause substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire us without the approval of our board of directors. As a result, the overall effect of the rights may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us. Because our board of directors can approve a redemption of the rights or a permitted offer, the rights should not interfere with a merger or other business combination approved by our board of directors. The adoption of the rights agreement was approved by our stockholders prior to our initial public offering. We have summarized the material terms and conditions of the rights agreement and the rights below. For a complete description of the rights, we encourage you to read the rights agreement, which we have filed as an exhibit to this annual report. Detachment of the Rights The rights are attached to all certificates representing our outstanding common stock and will attach to all common stock certificates we issue prior to the rights distribution date that we describe below. The rights are not exercisable until after the rights distribution date and will expire at the close of business on the tenth anniversary date of the adoption of the rights plan, unless we redeem or exchange them earlier as described below. The rights will separate from the common stock and a rights distribution date will occur, subject to specified exceptions, on the earlier of the following two dates: 10 days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons or an "acquiring person" has acquired or obtained the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock; or 10 business days following the start of a tender or exchange offer that would result, if closed, in a person becoming an "acquiring person." 78 Existing stockholders and their affiliates are excluded from the definition of "acquiring person" for purposes of the rights, and therefore their ownership or future share acquisitions cannot trigger the rights. Specified "inadvertent" owners that would otherwise become an acquiring person, including those who would have this designation as a result of repurchases of common stock by us, will not become acquiring persons as a result of those transactions. Our board of directors may defer the rights distribution date in some circumstances, and some inadvertent acquisitions will not result in a person becoming an acquiring person if the person promptly divests itself of a sufficient number of shares of common stock. Until the rights distribution date: our common stock certificates will evidence the rights, and the rights will be transferable only with those certificates; and any new shares of common stock will be issued with rights and new certificates will contain a notation incorporating the rights agreement by reference. As soon as practicable after the rights distribution date, the rights agent will mail certificates representing the rights to holders of record of common stock at the close of business on that date. After the rights distribution date, only separate rights certificates will represent the rights. We will not issue rights with any shares of common stock we issue after the rights distribution date, except as our board of directors may otherwise determine. Flip-In Event A "flip-in event" will occur under the rights agreement when a person becomes an acquiring person. If a flip-in event occurs and we do not redeem the rights as described under the heading "Redemption of Rights" below, each right, other than any right that has become void, as described below, will become exercisable at the time it is no longer redeemable for the number of shares of common stock, or, in some cases, cash, property or other of our securities, having a current market price equal to two times the exercise price of such right. If a flip-in event occurs, all rights that then are, or in some circumstances that were, beneficially owned by or transferred to an acquiring person or specified related parties will become void in the circumstances the rights agreement specifies. Flip-Over Event A "flip-over event" will occur under the rights agreement when, at any time after a person has become an acquiring person: we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction; or 50% or more of our assets, cash flows or earning power is sold or transferred. If a flip-over event occurs, each holder of a right, other than any right that has become void as we describe under the heading "Flip-In Event" above, will have the right to receive the number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company having a current market price equal to two times the exercise price of such right. Antidilution The number of outstanding rights associated with our common stock is subject to adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend or subdivision, combination or reclassification of our common stock occurring prior to the rights distribution date. With some exceptions, the rights agreement does not 79 require us to adjust the exercise price of the rights until cumulative adjustments amount to at least 1% of the exercise price. It also does not require us to issue fractional shares of our preferred stock that are not integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a share, and, instead we may make a cash adjustment based on the market price of the common stock on the last trading date prior to the date of exercise. The rights agreement reserves us the right to require, prior to the occurrence of any flip-in event or flip-over event that, on any exercise of rights, that a number of rights must be exercised so that we will issue only whole shares of stock. Redemption of Rights At any time until 10 days after the date on which the occurrence of a flip-in event is first publicly announced, we may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price of $0.01 per right. The redemption price is subject to adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring before the date of redemption. At our option, we may pay that redemption price in cash, shares of common stock or any other consideration our board of directors may select. The rights are not exercisable after a flip-in event until they are no longer redeemable. If our board of directors timely orders the redemption of the rights, the rights will terminate on the effectiveness of that action. Exchange of Rights We may, at our option, exchange the rights (other than rights owned by an acquiring person or an affiliate or an associate of an acquiring person, which have become void), in whole or in part. The exchange must be at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock per right, subject to specified adjustments at any time after the occurrence of a flip-in event and prior to: any person other than our existing stockholders becoming the beneficial owner of common stock with voting power equal to 50% or more of the total voting power of all shares of common stock entitled to vote in the election of directors; or the occurrence of a flip-over event. Amendment of Terms of Rights While the rights are outstanding, we may amend the provisions of the rights agreement only as follows: to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency; to make changes that do not adversely affect the interests of holders of rights, excluding the interests of any acquiring person; or to shorten or lengthen any time period under the rights agreement, except that we cannot change the time period when rights may be redeemed or lengthen any time period, unless such lengthening protects, enhances or clarifies the benefits of holders of rights other than an acquiring person. At any time when no rights are outstanding, we may amend any of the provisions of the rights agreement, other than decreasing the redemption price. Memorandum and Articles of Association Our purpose is to engage in any lawful act or activity relating to the business of chartering, rechartering or operating containerships, drybulk carriers or other vessels or any other lawful act or activity customarily conducted in conjunction with shipping, and any other lawful act or activity 80 approved by the board of directors. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws do not impose any limitations on the ownership rights of our stockholders. Under our bylaws, annual stockholder meetings will be held at a time and place selected by our board of directors. The meetings may be held in or outside of the Marshall Islands. Special meetings may be called by the board of directors or, at the request of the holders of a majority of our issued and outstanding stock entitled to vote on the matters proposed to be considered at such meeting, or by our secretary. Our board of directors may set a record date between 15 and 60 days before the date of any meeting to determine the stockholders that will be eligible to receive notice and vote at the meeting. Directors Our directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast at each annual meeting of the stockholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote in the election. There is no provision for cumulative voting. The board of directors may change the number of directors to not less than two, nor more than 15, by a vote of a majority of the entire board. Each director shall be elected to serve until the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, except in the event of death, resignation or removal. A vacancy on the board created by death, resignation, removal (which may only be for cause), or failure of the stockholders to elect the entire class of directors to be elected at any election of directors or for any other reason, may be filled only by an affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, at any special meeting called for that purpose or at any regular meeting of the board of directors. The board of directors has the authority to fix the amounts which shall be payable to the members of our board of directors for attendance at any meeting or for services rendered to us. Dissenters' Rights of Appraisal and Payment Under the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act, or the BCA, our stockholders have the right to dissent from various corporate actions, including any merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets not made in the usual course of our business, and to receive payment of the fair value of their shares. In the event of any further amendment of our articles of incorporation, a stockholder also has the right to dissent and receive payment for his or her shares if the amendment alters certain rights in respect of those shares. The dissenting stockholder must follow the procedures set forth in the BCA to receive payment. In the event that we and any dissenting stockholder fail to agree on a price for the shares, the BCA procedures involve, among other things, the institution of proceedings in the high court of the Republic of The Marshall Islands in which our Marshall Islands office is situated or in any appropriate jurisdiction outside the Marshall Islands in which our shares are primarily traded on a local or national securities exchange. The value of the shares of the dissenting stockholder is fixed by the court after reference, if the court so elects, to the recommendations of a court-appointed appraiser. Stockholders' Derivative Actions Under the BCA, any of our stockholders may bring an action in our name to procure a judgment in our favor, also known as a derivative action, provided that the stockholder bringing the action is a holder of common stock both at the time the derivative action is commenced and at the time of the transaction to which the action relates. Anti-takeover Provisions of our Charter Documents Several provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may have anti-takeover effects. These provisions are intended to avoid costly takeover battles, lessen our vulnerability to a hostile change of control and enhance the ability of our board of directors to maximize stockholder value in connection 81 with any unsolicited offer to acquire us. However, these anti-takeover provisions, which are summarized below, could also discourage, delay or prevent (1) the merger or acquisition of our company by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, that a stockholder may consider in its best interest and (2) the removal of incumbent officers and directors. Blank Check Preferred Stock Under the terms of our articles of incorporation, our board of directors has authority, without any further vote or action by our stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, of which 1,000,000 shares have been designated Series A Participating Preferred Stock in connection with our adoption of a stockholder rights plan as described above under "Stockholder Rights Plan." Our board of directors may issue shares of preferred stock on terms calculated to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or the removal of our management. Classified Board of Directors Our articles of incorporation provide for a board of directors serving staggered, three-year terms. Approximately one-third of our board of directors will be elected each year. This classified board provision could discourage a third party from making a tender offer for our shares or attempting to obtain control of our company. It could also delay stockholders who do not agree with the policies of the board of directors from removing a majority of the board of directors for two years. Election and Removal of Directors Our articles of incorporation and bylaws prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors. Our bylaws require parties other than the board of directors to give advance written notice of nominations for the election of directors. Our bylaws also provide that our directors may be removed only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662/3% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote for those directors. These provisions may discourage, delay or prevent the removal of incumbent officers and directors. Calling of Special Meetings of Stockholders Our bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called by our board of directors or, at the request of holders of a majority of the common stock entitled to vote at such meeting, by our secretary. Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations Our bylaws provide that stockholders seeking to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring business before an annual meeting of stockholders must provide timely notice of their proposal in writing to the corporate secretary. Generally, to be timely, a stockholder's notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the previous year's annual meeting. Our bylaws also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder's notice. These provisions may impede stockholders' ability to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders or to make nominations for directors at an annual meeting of stockholders. Business Combinations Although the BCA does not contain specific provisions regarding "business combinations" between companies organized under the laws of the Marshall Islands and "interested stockholders," we have included these provisions in our articles of incorporation. Specifically, our articles of incorporation 82 prohibit us from engaging in a "business combination" with certain persons for three years following the date the person becomes an interested stockholder. Interested stockholders generally include: any person who is the beneficial owner of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock; or any person who is our affiliate or associate and who held 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock at any time within three years before the date on which the person's status as an interested stockholder is determined, and the affiliates and associates of such person. Subject to certain exceptions, a business combination includes, among other things: certain mergers or consolidations of us or any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of ours; any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of our assets or of any subsidiary of ours having an aggregate market value equal to 10% or more of either the aggregate market value of all assets of us, determined on a consolidated basis, or the aggregate value of all the outstanding stock of us; certain transactions that result in the issuance or transfer by us of any stock of the corporation to the interested stockholder; any transaction involving us or any of our subsidiaries that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of any class or series of stock, or securities convertible into any class or series of stock, of ours or any such subsidiary that is owned directly or indirectly by the interested stockholder or any affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder; and any receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit directly or indirectly (except proportionately as a stockholder) of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or through us. These provisions of our articles of incorporation do not apply to a business combination if: before a person became an interested stockholder, our board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder; upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, other than certain excluded shares; at or following the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662/3% of our outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interest stockholder; the stockholder was or became an interested stockholder prior to the consummation of the initial public offering of our common stock under the Securities Act; a stockholder became an interested stockholder inadvertently and (i) as soon as practicable divests itself of ownership of sufficient shares so that the stockholder ceases to be an interested stockholder; and (ii) would not, at any time within the three-year period immediately prior to a business combination between our company and such stockholder, have been an interested stockholder but for the inadvertent acquisition of ownership; or the business combination is proposed prior to the consummation or abandonment of and subsequent to the earlier of the public announcement or the notice required under our articles 83 of incorporation which (i) constitutes one of the transactions described in the following sentence; (ii) is with or by a person who either was not an interested stockholder during the previous three years or who became an interested stockholder with the approval of the board; and (iii) is approved or not opposed by a majority of the members of the board of directors then in office (but not less than one) who were directors prior to any person becoming an interested stockholder during the previous three years or were recommended for election or elected to succeed such directors by a majority of such directors. The proposed transactions referred to in the preceding sentence are limited to: (i)a merger or consolidation of our company (except for a merger in respect of which, pursuant to the BCA, no vote of the stockholders of our company is required); (ii)a sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition (in one transaction or a series of transactions), whether as part of a dissolution or otherwise, of assets of our company or of any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of our company (other than to any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary or to our company) having an aggregate market value equal to 50% or more of either that aggregate market value of all of the assets of our company determined on a consolidated basis or the aggregate market value of all the outstanding shares; or (iii)a proposed tender or exchange offer for 50% or more of our outstanding voting stock.

HSH Nordbank Credit Facility On December 17, 2002, we, as guarantor, and certain of our vessel-owning subsidiaries, as borrowers, entered into a $60.0 million credit facility with HSH Nordbank AG and Dresdner Bank, which we refer to as the HSH Nordbank credit facility, with a term of 10 years to finance a portion of the purchase price of the Maersk Deva (ex Vancouver Express) and the Maersk Derby (ex P&O Nedlloyd Caracas). As of March 31, 2008, $44.0 million was outstanding under this credit facility. 84 The interest rate on the HSH Nordbank credit facility is LIBOR plus 0.775%. Beginning on June 11, 2004, we began repaying the principal amount of this loan, which is payable in 40 consecutive quarterly installments of $1.0 million together with a balloon payment of $20.0 million payable with the final installment. KEXIM Credit Facility On May 13, 2003, we, as guarantor, and certain of our vessel-owning subsidiaries, as borrowers, entered into a $124.4 million credit facility with the Export-Import Bank of Korea, which we refer to as our KEXIM credit facility, for a term of 12 years to finance a portion of the purchase price of the CSCL Europe and the MSC Baltic (ex CSCL America). As of March 31, 2008, $88.6 million was outstanding under this credit facility. Interest on borrowings under the KEXIM credit facility accrues at a rate of 5.0125%, which includes a fee of 0.3725% per annum. Beginning on December 15, 2004, we began repaying the principal amount of this loan in 48 consecutive quarterly installments of $2.6 million (except for the first installment of $1.5 million) plus installments of $1.3 million, $1.0 million and $0.69 million payable in August 2016, September 2016 and November 2016, respectively. In connection with our KEXIM facility, on November 15, 2004, we entered into an interest rate hedging transaction with RBS. The transaction is an amortizing interest rate swap, with the end result being the conversion of the fixed rate payable on the loan to a floating rate (U.S. dollar LIBOR). The notional amortizing schedule of the swap exactly mirrors the amortization schedule of the above loan. KEXIM-Fortis Credit Facility On January 29, 2004, we, as guarantor, and certain of our vessel-owning subsidiaries, as borrowers, entered into a $144.0 million credit facility with the Export-Import Bank of Korea and Fortis Capital, which we refer to as the KEXIM-Fortis credit facility, repayable over 12 years commencing with the delivery of the CSCL Pusan (ex HN 1559) and the CSCL Le Havre (ex HN 1561). As of March 31, 2008, $130.0 million was outstanding under this credit facility and there were no undrawn funds available. The KEXIM-Fortis credit facility is organized in two tranches, Tranche A and Tranche B. Each of Tranche A and Tranche B is comprised of two parts. One part of Tranche A, consisting of $67.5 million, and Tranche B, consisting of $4.5 million, is attributable to the CSCL Pusan. The second part of Tranche A, consisting of $67.5 million, and Tranche B, consisting of $4.5 million, is attributable to the CSCL Le Havre (ex HN 1561). The portion of Tranche A attributable to the CSCL Pusan (ex HN 1559) is repayable in 24 semi-annual installments of $2.8 million each, commencing on March 15, 2007. The portion of Tranche B attributable to the CSCL Pusan consists of a balloon payment of $4.5 million payable with the final installment of Tranche A on September 8, 2018. The portion of Tranche A attributable to the CSCL Le Havre is repayable in 24 semi-annual installments of $2.8 million each, commencing on March 15, 2007. The portion of Tranche B attributable to the CSCL Le Havre consists of a balloon payment of $4.5 payable with the final installment of Tranche A on March 15, 2019. Interest on borrowings under Tranche A of the KEXIM-Fortis credit facility accrues at a rate of 5.02%, which includes a fee of 0.27% per annum. Interest on borrowings under Tranche B of the KEXIM-Fortis credit facility accrues at LIBOR plus 1.25%. Aegean Baltic-HSH Nordbank Credit Facility On November 14, 2006, we, as borrower, and certain of our vessel-owning subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a $700.0 million revolving and term loan credit facility with Aegean Baltic 85 Bank S.A. and HSH Nordbank AG, which we refer to as the Aegean Baltic-HSH Nordbank credit facility and is organized in two tranches, Tranche A and Tranche B. The credit facility is for a committed amount of $700.0 million and is collateralized by mortgages and other security relating to the CMA CGM Elbe, the CMA CGM Kalamata, the CMA CGM Komodo, the CMA CGM Passiflore, the Hyundai Commodore, the Hyundai Duke, the CMA CGM Vanille, the Maersk Marathon, the Maersk Messologi, the Maersk Mytilini, the YM Yantian, the Al Rayyan (ex Norasia Hamburg), the YM Milano, the CMA CGM Lotus, the Hyundai Vladivostok, the Hyundai Advance, the Hyundai Stride, the Hyundai Future and the Hyundai Sprinter and the APL Belgium. We used the borrowings under Tranche A to refinance outstanding indebtedness under our existing credit facility with Aegean Baltic Bank, which was collateralized by mortgages and other security relating to the APL Belgium, the APL Scotland and the Hyundai Commodore. Tranche B of the Aegean Baltic-HSH Nordbank credit facility is for a maximum amount of $500.0 million. Tranche B is to be used to provide financing for future vessel acquisitions, or other ship financing or corporate activities. The interest rate on the Aegean Baltic-HSH Nordbank credit facility is 0.70% over LIBOR. The revolving period commenced on November 14, 2006 and will have a duration of five years. The loan is repayable in up to 20 consecutive quarterly installments beginning in 2012 and a balloon payment, if applicable, together with the last payment due in 2016. Specifically, the repayment schedule as well as the balloon will be determined based upon the weighted average age of the vessels that will comprise the securities portfolio for this loan at the end of the fifth year (i.e., November 14, 2011). As of March 31, 2008, $675.0 million was outstanding under the Aegean Baltic-HSH Nordbank credit facility and $25.0 million of undrawn availability remained available to us for future borrowings. Royal Bank of Scotland Credit Facility On February 20, 2007, we, as borrower, and certain of our vessel-owning subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a $700.0 million senior revolving credit facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland, which we refer to as the RBS credit facility. As of December 31, 2007, the utilized portion of this facility was $435.25 million, with the remaining $264.75 million committed, available for future drawings. The drawn amount consists of $400 million in drawn funds and $35.25 million in the form of a payment guarantee issued in favor of Shanghai Jiangnan Changxing Heavy Industry Company Limited, guaranteeing part of the payments under the shipbuilding contract for HN H1022A. This guarantee is partly cash collateralised by $7.05 million or 20% of the guaranteed amount, which is in a restricted account with RBS. The $400 million outstanding loan balance consists of the following: a.$38 million collateralized by the MOL Confidence, repayable in two semi-annual instalments of $16.7 million each, the first instalment being payable on October 31, 2012, together with a balloon of $4.6 million payable together with the last instalment. b.$69 million collateralized by the YM Colombo, repayable in ten semi-annual instalments of $4.6 million each, the first instalment being payable on October 31, 2012, together with a balloon of $23 million payable together with the last instalment. c.$69 million collateralized by the Norasia Atria, repayable in ten semi-annual instalments of $4.6 million each, the first instalment being payable on April 30, 2013, together with a balloon of $23 million payable together with the last instalment. d.$72 million collateralized by the YM Seattle, repayable in ten semi-annual instalments of $4 million each, the first instalment being payable on April 30, 2013, together with a balloon of $32 million payable together with the last instalment. 86 e.$72 million collateralized by the YM Vancouver, repayable in ten semi-annual instalments of $4 million each, the first instalment being payable on April 30, 2013, together with a balloon of $32 million payable together with the last instalment. f.$18.8 million collateralized by the assigned refund guarantee covering $23.5 million of pre-delivery payments related to HN H1022A. Since this is pre-delivery financing, the amortization period will commence five years after delivery of the vessel. Six months after this five-year period ends, the amount will be reduced by 10 equal semi-annual reductions, together with a balloon reduction payable with the final instalment calculated on the basis of an 18 year loan amortization profile. We have the option at any point before delivery of the said vessel to substitute this security with another vessel, with the amortization to be determined at that point based on the above 18 year profile. g.$26.6 million collateralized by the assigned refund guarantee covering $33.2 million of pre-delivery payments related to HN S456. Since this is pre-delivery financing, the amortization period will commence five years after delivery of the vessel. Six months after this five-year period ends, the amount will be reduced by 10 equal semi-annual reductions, together with a balloon reduction payable with the final instalment calculated on the basis of an 18 year loan amortization profile. We have the option at any point before delivery of the said vessel to substitute this security with another vessel, with the amortization to be determined at that point based on the above 18 year profile. h.$26.6 million collateralized by the assigned refund guarantee covering $33.2 million of pre-delivery payments related to HN S457. Since this is pre-delivery financing, the amortization period will commence 5 years after delivery of the vessel. Six months after this five-year period ends, the amount will be reduced by 10 equal semi-annual reductions, together with a balloon reduction payable with the final instalment calculated on the basis of an 18 year loan amortization profile. We have the option at any point before delivery of the said vessel to substitute this security with another vessel, with the amortization to be determined at that point based on the above 18 year profile. i.$8 million collateralized by the assigned refund guarantee covering $33.2 million of pre-delivery payments related to HN S457.

As of March 31, 2008, $546.9 million was the utilized portion under the RBS credit facility and $153.1 million of undrawn availability remained available to us for future borrowings. Emporiki Bank of Greece S.A Credit Facility On February 15, 2008, we, as borrower, and certain of our vessel-owning subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a credit facility for up to $156.8 million to finance part of the purchase price of the Hull No S4001 and Hull No S4002. As of March 31, 2008, $47.4 million was outstanding under this credit facility and $109.4 million of undrawn availability remained available to us for future borrowings. The interest rate on the Emporiki Bank of Greece S.A credit facility is LIBOR plus 0.65%. The credit facility will be repaid over a 12 year period, with two years' grace period, in 20 equal consecutive semiannual installments of $4.25 million and a balloon payment of $71.8 million along with the final 87 installment. The first installment will be payable on the earlier date of the date falling 30 months from the delivery date of the second vessel mortgaged thereunder and December 31, 2011. Seasonal Maritime Corporation Credit Facilities We borrowed an aggregate amount of $75.0 million ($15.0 million with respect to each vessel) under an unsecured loan agreement, dated August 14, 2006, with Seasonal Maritime Corporation to partially finance the acquisition of the five 6,500 TEU newbuildings we ordered on July 26, 2006. This loan bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.0% per annum and matured six months after execution of the loan agreement, with an option for an additional six months repayment term for the borrower. In addition, a flat fee of $112,500 was paid upon execution of the loan agreement and a commitment fee of 0.30% per annum was payable quarterly on any undrawn amount, commencing August 14, 2006. We borrowed an additional aggregate amount of $25.0 million under an unsecured loan agreement, dated September 25, 2006, with Seasonal Maritime Corporation, to finance installment payments on the HN 1670, the HN 1671, the HN 1672 and the HN 1673, made on September 28, 2006. This loan bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.0% per annum and matured six months after execution of the loan agreement, with an option for an additional six months repayment term for the borrower. In addition, a flat fee of $37,500 was paid upon execution of the loan agreement and a commitment fee of 0.30% per annum was payable quarterly on any undrawn amount, commencing September 25, 2006. We believe the fees and interest payable under these loan agreements were no less favorable than those we could obtain in arm's-length negotiations with an unrelated third party. We repaid the entire amount outstanding under these loans on December 28, 2006, with borrowings made under our RBS and Aegean Baltic-HSH Nordbank credit facilities. Exchange Controls and Other Limitations Affecting Stockholders Under Marshall Islands and Greek law, there are currently no restrictions on the export or import of capital, including foreign exchange controls or restrictions that affect the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of our common stock. We are not aware of any limitations on the rights to own our common stock, including rights of non-resident or foreign stockholders to hold or exercise voting rights on our common stock, imposed by foreign law or by our articles of incorporation or bylaws. Tax Considerations Marshall Islands Tax Considerations We are a Marshall Islands corporation. Because we do not, and we do not expect that we will, conduct business or operations in the Marshall Islands, under current Marshall Islands law we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains and our stockholders will not be subject to Marshall Islands taxation or withholding on dividends and other distributions, including upon a return of capital, we make to our stockholders. In addition, our stockholders will not be subject to Marshall Islands stamp, capital gains or other taxes on the purchase, ownership or disposition of common stock, and our stockholders will not be required by the Republic of The Marshall Islands to file a tax return relating to the common stock. Each stockholder is urged to consult their tax counsel or other advisor with regard to the legal and tax consequences, under the laws of pertinent jurisdictions, including the Marshall Islands, of their investment in us. Further, it is the responsibility of each stockholder to file all state, local and non-U.S., as well as U.S. federal tax returns that may be required of them. 88 Liberian Tax Considerations The Republic of Liberia enacted a new income tax act effective as of January 1, 2001 (the "New Act"). In contrast to the income tax law previously in effect since 1977, the New Act does not distinguish between the taxation of "non-resident" Liberian corporations, such as our Liberian subsidiaries, which conduct no business in Liberia and were wholly exempt from taxation under the prior law, and "resident" Liberian corporations which conduct business in Liberia and are (and were under the prior law) subject to taxation. In 2004, the Liberian Ministry of Finance issued regulations exempting non-resident corporations engaged in international shipping, such as our Liberian subsidiaries, from Liberian taxation under the New Act retroactive to January 1, 2001. It is unclear whether these regulations, which ostensibly conflict with the provisions of the New Act, are a valid exercise of the regulatory authority of the Liberian Ministry of Finance such that the regulations can be considered unquestionably enforceable. However, an opinion dated December 23, 2004 addressed by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Republic of Liberia to The LISCR Trust Company stated that the regulations are a valid exercise of the regulatory authority of the Ministry of Finance. The Liberian Ministry of Finance has not at any time since January 1, 2001 sought to collect taxes from any of our Liberian subsidiaries. If, however, our Liberian subsidiaries were subject to Liberian income tax under the New Act, they would be subject to tax at a rate of 35% on their worldwide income. As a result, their, and subsequently our, net income and cash flow would be materially reduced. In addition, as the ultimate shareholder of the Liberian subsidiaries we would be subject to Liberian withholding tax on dividends paid by our Liberian subsidiaries at rates ranging from 15% to 20%. United States Federal Income Tax Considerations The following discussion of United States federal income tax matters is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Code, judicial decisions, administrative pronouncements, and existing and proposed regulations issued by the United States Department of the Treasury, all of which are in effect and available and subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Except as otherwise noted, this discussion is based on the assumption that we will not maintain an office or other fixed place of business within the United States. We have no current intention of maintaining such an office. References in this discussion to "we" and "us" are to Danaos Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless the context otherwise requires. United States Federal Income Taxation of Our Company Taxation of Operating Income: In General Unless exempt from United States federal income taxation under the rules discussed below, a foreign corporation is subject to United States federal income taxation in respect of any income that is derived from the use of vessels, from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time, operating or bareboat charter basis, from the participation in a pool, partnership, strategic alliance, joint operating agreement or other joint venture it directly or indirectly owns or participates in that generates such income, or from the performance of services directly related to those uses, which we refer to as "shipping income," to the extent that the shipping income is derived from sources within the United States. For these purposes, 50% of shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States constitutes income from sources within the United States, which we refer to as "United States-source shipping income." 89 Shipping income attributable to transportation that both begins and ends in the United States is generally considered to be 100% from sources within the United States. We do not expect to engage in transportation that produces income which is considered to be 100% from sources within the United States. Shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between non-United States ports is generally considered to be 100% derived from sources outside the United States. Shipping income derived from sources outside the United States will not be subject to any United States federal income tax. In the absence of exemption from tax under Section 883 of the Code, our gross United States-source shipping income, unless determined to be effectively connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business, as described below, would be subject to a 4% tax imposed without allowance for deductions as described below. Exemption of Operating Income from United States Federal Income Taxation Under Section 883 of the Code, for taxable years after 2005 we will be exempt from United States federal income taxation on our United States-source shipping income if: (1)we are organized in a foreign country (our "country of organization") that grants an "equivalent exemption" to corporations organized in the United States; and (2)either (A) more than 50% of the value of our stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by individuals who are "residents" of our country of organization or of another foreign country that grants an "equivalent exemption" to corporations organized in the United States, which we refer to as the "50% Ownership Test"; or (B) our stock is "primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market" in our country of organization, in another country that grants an "equivalent exemption" to United States corporations, or in the United States, which we refer to as the "Publicly-Traded Test." We believe, based on Revenue Ruling 2008-17, 2008-12 IRB 626, and, in the case of the Marshall Islands, an exchange of notes between the United States and the Marshall Islands, 1990-2 C.B. 321, in the case of Liberia, an exchange of notes between the United States and Liberia, 1988-1 C.B. 463, in the case of Cyprus, an exchange of notes between the United States and Cyprus, 1989-2 C.B. 332 and, in the case of Singapore, an exchange of notes between the United States and Singapore, 1990-2 C.B. 323, (each an "Exchange of Notes") that the Marshall Islands, Liberia, Cyprus and Singapore, the jurisdictions in which we and our ship-owning subsidiaries are incorporated, grant an "equivalent exemption" to United States corporations. Therefore, we believe that, for taxable years after 2005, we will be exempt from United States federal income taxation with respect to our United States-source shipping income if either the 50% Ownership Test or the Publicly-Traded Test is met. For taxable years following 2005, it may be difficult to satisfy the 50% Ownership Test due to the widely-held ownership of our stock. Our ability to satisfy the Publicly-Traded Test is discussed below. The Section 883 regulations provide, in pertinent part, that stock of a foreign corporation will be considered to be "primarily traded" on an established securities market in a particular country if the number of shares of each class of stock that are traded during any taxable year on all established securities markets in that country exceeds the number of shares in each such class that are traded during that year on established securities markets in any other single country. For 2007 our common stock, which is the sole class of our issued and outstanding stock, was "primarily traded" on the New York Stock Exchange and we anticipate that that will also be the case for subsequent taxable years. 90 Under the regulations, our common stock will be considered to be "regularly traded" on an established securities market if one or more classes of our stock representing more than 50% of our outstanding shares, by total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and total value, is listed on the market. We refer to this as the listing threshold. Since our common stock is our sole class of stock we satisfied the listing requirement for 2006 and expect to continue to satisfy this requirement for subsequent taxable years. It is further required that with respect to each class of stock relied upon to meet the listing threshold (i) such class of the stock is traded on the market, other than in minimal quantities, on at least 60 days during the taxable year or 1/6 of the days in a short taxable year; and (ii) the aggregate number of shares of such class of stock traded on such market is at least 10% of the average number of shares of such class of stock outstanding during such year or as appropriately adjusted in the case of a short taxable year. We believe that we satisfied the trading frequency and trading volume tests years for 2007 and we expect to continue to satisfy these requirements for subsequent taxable years. Even if this were not the case, the regulations provide that the trading frequency and trading volume tests will be deemed satisfied if, as was the case for 2007 and we expect to be the case with our common stock for subsequent taxable years, such class of stock is traded on an established market in the United States and such stock is regularly quoted by dealers making a market in such stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the regulations provide, in pertinent part, that a class of our stock will not be considered to be "regularly traded" on an established securities market for any taxable year in which 50% or more of such class of our outstanding shares of the stock is owned, actually or constructively under specified stock attribution rules, on more than half the days during the taxable year by persons who each own 5% or more of the value of such class of our outstanding stock, which we refer to as the "5 Percent Override Rule." For purposes of being able to determine the persons who own 5% or more of our stock, or "5% Stockholders," the regulations permit us to rely on those persons that are identified on Schedule 13G and Schedule 13D filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the "SEC," as having a 5% or more beneficial interest in our common stock. The regulations further provide that an investment company which is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, will not be treated as a 5% Stockholder for such purposes. More than 50% of our shares of common stock are owned by 5% stockholders. In such circumstances, we will be subject to the 5% Override Rule unless we can establish that among the shares included in the closely-held block of our shares of common stock are a sufficient number of shares of common stock that are owned or treated as owned by "qualified stockholders" that the shares of common stock included in such block that are not so treated could not constitute 50% or more of the shares of our common stock for more than half the number of days during the taxable year. In order to establish this, such qualified stockholders would have to comply with certain documentation and certification requirements designed to substantiate their identity as qualified stockholders. For these purposes, a "qualified stockholder" includes (i) an individual that owns or is treated as owning shares of our common stock and is a resident of a jurisdiction that provides an exemption that is equivalent to that provided by Section 883 of the Code and (ii) certain other persons. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to the 5 Percent Override Rule with respect to any taxable year. Approximately 80.0% of our shares will be treated, under applicable attribution rules, as owned by the Coustas Family Trust whose ownership of our shares will be attributed, during his lifetime, to John Coustas, our chief executive officer, for purposes of Section 883. Dr. Coustas has entered into an agreement with us regarding his compliance, and the compliance of certain entities that he controls and through which he owns our shares, with the certification requirements designed to substantiate status as qualified stockholders. In certain circumstances, including circumstances where Dr. Coustas ceases to be a "qualified stockholder" or where the Coustas Family Trust transfers some or all of our shares that 91 it holds, Dr Coustas' compliance, and the compliance of certain entities that he controls or through which he owns our shares, with the terms of the agreement with us will not enable us to satisfy the requirements for the benefits of Section 883. Following Dr. Coustas' death, there can be no assurance that our shares that are treated, under applicable attribution rules, as owned by the Coustas Family Trust will be treated as owned by a "qualified stockholder" or that any "qualified stockholder" to whom ownership of all or a portion of such ownership is attributed will comply with the ownership certification requirements under Section 883. Accordingly there can be no assurance that we or our subsidiaries will qualify for the benefits of Section 883 for any taxable year. To the extent the benefits of Section 883 are unavailable, our U.S.-source shipping income, to the extent not considered to be "effectively connected" with the conduct of a United States trade or business, as described below, would be subject to a 4% tax imposed by Section 887 of the Code on a gross basis, without the benefit of deductions. Since, under the sourcing rules described above, we expect that no more than 50% of our shipping income would be treated as being derived from United States sources, we expect that the maximum effective rate of United States federal income tax on our gross shipping income would never exceed 2% under the 4% gross basis tax regime. Many of our charters contain provisions obligating the charter to reimburse us for amounts paid in respect of the 4% tax with respect to the activities of the vessel subject to the charter. To the extent the benefits of the Section 883 exemption are unavailable and our United States-source shipping income is considered to be "effectively connected" with the conduct of a United States trade or business, as described below, any such "effectively connected" U.S.-source shipping income, net of applicable deductions, would be subject to the United States federal corporate income tax currently imposed at rates of up to 35%. In addition, we may be subject to the 30% "branch profits" taxes on earnings effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business, as determined after allowance for certain adjustments, and on certain interest paid or deemed paid attributable to the conduct of our United States trade or business. Our U.S.-source shipping income, other than leasing income, will be considered "effectively connected" with the conduct of a United States trade or business only if: we have, or are considered to have, a fixed place of business in the United States involved in the earning of shipping income; and substantially all (at least 90%) of our U.S.-source shipping income, other than leasing income, is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for operatings that begin or end in the United States. Our U.S.-source shipping income from leasing will be considered "effectively connected" with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business only if: we have, or are considered to have a fixed place of business in the United States that is involved in the meaning of such leasing income; and substantially all (at least 90%) of our U.S.-source shipping income from leasing is attributable to such fixed place of business. For these purposes, leasing income is treated as attributable to a fixed place of business where such place of business is a material factor in the realization of such income and such income is realized in the ordinary course of business carried on through such fixed place of business. Based on the foregoing and on the expected mode of our shipping operations and other activities, we believe that none of our U.S.-source shipping income will be "effectively connected" with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business. 92 United States Taxation of Gain on Sale of Vessels Regardless of whether we qualify for exemption under Section 883, we will not be subject to United States federal income taxation with respect to gain realized on a sale of a vessel, provided the sale is considered to occur outside of the United States under United States federal income tax principles. In general, a sale of a vessel will be considered to occur outside of the United States for this purpose if title to the vessel, and risk of loss with respect to the vessel, pass to the buyer outside of the United States. It is expected that any sale of a vessel will be so structured that it will be considered to occur outside of the United States unless any gain from such sale is expected to qualify for exemption under Section 883. United States Federal Income Taxation of United States Holders As used herein, the term "United States Holder" means a beneficial owner of common stock that is a United States citizen or resident, United States corporation or other United States entity taxable as a corporation, an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. If a partnership holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. Partners in a partnership holding our common stock are encouraged to consult their tax advisor. Distributions Subject to the discussion of passive foreign investment companies below, any distributions made by us with respect to our common stock to a United States Holder will generally constitute dividends, which may be taxable as ordinary income or "qualified dividend income" as described in more detail below, to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under United States federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of our earnings and profits will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the United States Holder's tax basis in his common stock on a dollar for dollar basis and thereafter as capital gain. Because we are not a United States corporation, United States Holders that are corporations will not be entitled to claim a dividends received deduction with respect to any distributions they receive from us. Dividends paid with respect to our common stock will generally be treated as passive category income or, in the case of certain types of United States Holders, general category income for purposes of computing allowable foreign tax credits for United States foreign tax credit purposes. Dividends paid on our common stock to a United States Holder who is an individual, trust or estate (a "United States Individual Holder") should be treated as "qualified dividend income" that is taxable to such United States Individual Holders at preferential tax rates (through 2010) provided that (1) the common stock is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States (such as the New York Stock Exchange); (2) we are not a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for the taxable year during which the dividend is paid or the immediately preceding taxable year (see the discussion below under "PFIC Status and Material U.S. Federal Tax Consequences"); and (3) the United States Individual Holder owns the common stock for more than 60 days in the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the date on which the common stock becomes ex-dividend. Special rules may apply to any "extraordinary dividend". Generally, an extraordinary dividend is a dividend in an amount which is equal to or in excess of ten percent of a stockholder's adjusted basis (or fair market value in certain circumstances) in a share of common stock paid by us. If we pay an "extraordinary dividend" on our common stock that is treated as "qualified dividend income," then any loss derived by a United States Individual Holder from the sale or exchange of such common stock will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of such dividend. There is no assurance that any dividends paid on our 93 common stock will be eligible for these preferential rates in the hands of a United States Individual Holder. Any dividends paid by us which are not eligible for these preferential rates will be taxed to a United States Individual Holder at the standard ordinary income rates. Legislation has been introduced that would deny the preferential rate of federal income tax currently imposed on qualified dividend income with respect to dividends received from a non-U.S. corporation, unless the non-U.S. corporation either is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States or is created or organized under the laws of a foreign country which has a comprehensive income tax system. Because the Marshall Islands has not entered into a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States and imposes only limited taxes on corporations organized under its laws, it is unlikely that we could satisfy either of these requirements. Consequently, if this legislation were enacted in its current form the preferential rate of federal income tax described above may no longer be applicable to dividends received from us. As of the date hereof, it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or in what form the proposed legislation will be enacted. Sale, Exchange or other Disposition of Common Stock Assuming we do not constitute a PFIC for any taxable year, a United States Holder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss upon a sale, exchange or other disposition of our common stock in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized by the United States Holder from such sale, exchange or other disposition and the United States Holder's tax basis in such stock. Such gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the United States Holder's holding period is greater than one year at the time of the sale, exchange or other disposition. Such capital gain or loss will generally be treated as United States-source income or loss, as applicable, for United States foreign tax credit purposes. A United States Holder's ability to deduct capital losses is subject to certain limitations. PFIC Status and Material U.S. Federal Tax Consequences Special United States federal income tax rules apply to a United States Holder that holds stock in a foreign corporation classified as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for United States federal income tax purposes. In general, we will be treated as a PFIC in any taxable year in which, after applying certain look-through rules, either: at least 75% of our gross income for such taxable year consists of passive income (e.g., dividends, interest, capital gains and rents derived other than in the active conduct of a rental business); or at least 50% of the average value of our assets during such taxable year produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. For purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC, we will be treated as earning and owning our proportionate share of the income and assets, respectively, of any of our subsidiary corporations in which we own at least 25% of the value of the subsidiary's stock. Income earned, or deemed earned, by us in connection with the performance of services will not constitute passive income. By contrast, rental income will generally constitute "passive income" unless we are treated under specific rules as deriving our rental income in the active conduct of a trade or business. We may hold, directly or indirectly, interests in other entities that are PFICs ("Subsidiary PFICs"). If we are a PFIC, each United States Holder will be treated as owning its pro rata share by value of the stock of any such Subsidiary PFICs. While there are legal uncertainties involved in this determination, we believe that we should not be treated as a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2007. We believe that, although there is no legal authority directly on point, the gross income that we derive from time chartering activities of our subsidiaries should constitute services income rather than rental income. Consequently, such income 94 should not constitute passive income and the vessels that we or our subsidiaries operate in connection with the production of such income should not constitute passive assets for purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC. There is legal authority supporting this position consisting of case law and Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, pronouncements concerning the characterization of income derived from time charters as services income for other tax purposes. However, in the absence of any legal authority specifically relating to the statutory provisions governing PFICs, the IRS or a court could disagree with this opinion. No assurance can be given that this result will not occur. In addition, although we intend to conduct our affairs in a manner to avoid being classified as a PFIC, we cannot assure you that the nature of our assets, income and operations will not change, or that we can avoid being treated as a PFIC for any taxable year. As discussed more fully below, if we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, a United States Holder would be subject to different taxation rules depending on whether the United States Holder makes an election to treat us as a "Qualified Electing Fund," which election we refer to as a "QEF election." As an alternative to making a QEF election, a United States Holder should be able to make a "mark-to-market" election with respect to our common stock, as discussed below. Taxation of United States Holders Making a Timely QEF Election If a United States Holder makes a timely QEF election, which United States Holder we refer to as an "Electing Holder," for United States federal income tax purposes each year the Electing Holder must report his, her or its pro-rata share of our ordinary earnings and our net capital gain, if any, for our taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year of the Electing Holder, regardless of whether or not distributions were received from us by the Electing Holder. Generally, a QEF election should be made on or before the due date for filing the electing United States Holder's U.S. federal income tax return for the first taxable year in which our common stock is held by such United States Holder and we are classified as a PFIC. The Electing Holder's adjusted tax basis in the common stock would be increased to reflect taxed but undistributed earnings and profits. Distributions of earnings and profits that had been previously taxed would result in a corresponding reduction in the adjusted tax basis in the common stock and would not be taxed again once distributed. An Electing Holder would generally recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common stock. A United States Holder would make a QEF election with respect to any year that our company and any Subsidiary PFIC are treated as PFICs by filing one copy of IRS Form 8621 with his, her or its United States federal income tax return and a second copy in accordance with the instructions to such form. If we were to become aware that we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, we would notify all United States Holders of such treatment and would provide all necessary information to any United States Holder who requests such information in order to make the QEF election described above with respect to our common stock and the stock of any Subsidiary PFIC. Taxation of United States Holders Making a "Mark-to-Market" Election Alternatively, if we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year and, as we anticipate, our common stock is treated as "marketable stock," a United States Holder would be allowed to make a "mark-to-market" election with respect to our common stock, provided the United States Holder completes and files IRS Form 8621 in accordance with the relevant instructions and related Treasury Regulations. If that election is made, the United States Holder generally would include as ordinary income in each taxable year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the common stock at the end of the taxable year over such holder's adjusted tax basis in the common stock. The United States Holder also would be permitted an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the United States Holder's adjusted tax basis in the common stock over its fair market value at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. A United States Holder's tax basis in his, her or its common stock would be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amount. Gain realized on the sale, exchange or other 95 disposition of our common stock would be treated as ordinary income, and any loss realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the common stock would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent that such loss does not exceed the net mark-to-market gains previously included by the United States Holder. A mark-to-market election under the PFIC rules with respect to our common stock would not apply to a Subsidiary PFIC, and a United States Holder would not be able to make such a mark-to-market election in respect of its indirect ownership interest in that Subsidiary PFIC. Consequently, United States Holders of our common stock could be subject to the PFIC rules with respect to income of the Subsidiary PFIC, the value of which already had been taken into account indirectly via mark-to-market adjustments. Taxation of United States Holders Not Making a Timely QEF or Mark-to-Market Election Finally, if we were treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, a United States Holder who does not make either a QEF election or a "mark-to-market" election for that year, whom we refer to as a "Non-Electing Holder," would be subject to special rules with respect to (1) any excess distribution (i.e., the portion of any distributions received by the Non-Electing Holder on our common stock in a taxable year in excess of 125% of the average annual distributions received by the Non-Electing Holder in the three preceding taxable years, or, if shorter, the Non-Electing Holder's holding period for the common stock) and (2) any gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common stock. Under these special rules: the excess distribution or gain would be allocated ratably over the Non-Electing Holder's aggregate holding period for the common stock; the amount allocated to the current taxable year or to any portion of the United States Holder's holding period prior to the first taxable year for which we were a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income; and the amount allocated to each of the other taxable years would be subject to tax at the highest rate of tax in effect for the applicable class of taxpayer for that year, and an interest charge for the deemed deferral benefit would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such other taxable year. If a Non-Electing Holder who is an individual dies before January 1, 2010, while owning our common stock, such holder's successor generally will not receive a step-up in tax basis with respect to such stock. If a United States Holder held our common stock during a period when we were treated as a PFIC but the United States Holder did not have a QEF election in effect with respect to us, then in the event that we failed to qualify as a PFIC for a subsequent taxable year, the United States Holder could elect to cease to be subject to the rules described above with respect to those shares by making a "deemed sale" or, in certain circumstances, a "deemed dividend" election with respect to our common stock. If the United States Holder makes a deemed sale election, the United States Holder will be treated, for purposes of applying the rules described in the preceding paragraph, as having disposed of our common stock for their fair market value on the last day of the last taxable year for which we qualified as a PFIC (the "termination date"). The United States Holder would increase his, her or its basis in such common stock by the amount of the gain on the deemed sale described in the preceding sentence. Following a deemed sale election, the United States Holder would not be treated, for purposes of the PFIC rules, as having owned the common stock during a period prior to the termination date when we qualified as a PFIC. If we were treated as a "controlled foreign corporation" for United States tax purposes for the taxable year that included the termination date, then a United States Holder could make a deemed dividend election with respect to our common stock. If a deemed dividend election is made, the United States Holder is required to include in income as a dividend his, her or its pro rata share (based on all 96 of our stock held by the United States Holder, directly or under applicable attribution rules, on the termination date) of our post-1986 earnings and profits as of the close of the taxable year that includes the termination date (taking only earnings and profits accumulated in taxable years in which we were a PFIC into account). The deemed dividend described in the preceding sentence is treated as an excess distribution for purposes of the rules described in the second preceding paragraph. The United States Holder would increase his, her or its basis in our common stock by the amount of the deemed dividend. Following a deemed dividend election, the United States Holder would not be treated, for purposes of the PFIC rules, as having owned the common stock during a period prior to the termination date when we qualified as a PFIC. For purposes of determining whether the deemed dividend election is available, we will generally be treated as a controlled foreign corporation for a taxable year when, at any time during that year, United States persons, each of whom owns, directly or under applicable attribution rules, common stock having 10% or more of the total voting power of our common stock, in the aggregate own, directly or under applicable attribution rules, shares representing more than 50% of the voting power or value of our common stock. A deemed sale or deemed dividend election must be made on the United States Holder's original or amended return for the shareholder's taxable year that includes the termination date and, if made on an amended return, such amended return must be filed not later than the date that is three years after the due date of the original return for such taxable year. Special rules apply where a person is treated, for purposes of the PFIC rules, as indirectly owning our common stock. United States Federal Income Taxation of "Non-United States Holders" A beneficial owner of common stock that is not a United States Holder and is not treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes is referred to herein as a "Non-United States Holder." Dividends on Common Stock Non-United States Holders generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax or withholding tax on dividends received from us with respect to our common stock, unless that income is effectively connected with the Non-United States Holder's conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If the Non-United States Holder is entitled to the benefits of a United States income tax treaty with respect to those dividends, that income generally is taxable only if it is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-United States Holder in the United States. Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Stock Non-United States Holders generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common stock, unless: the gain is effectively connected with the Non-United States Holder's conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If the Non-United States Holder is entitled to the benefits of an income tax treaty with respect to that gain, that gain generally is taxable only if it is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-United States Holder in the United States; or the Non-United States Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of disposition and other conditions are met. If the Non-United States Holder is engaged in a United States trade or business for United States federal income tax purposes, the income from the common stock, including dividends and the gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition of the stock that is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business will generally be subject to regular United States federal income tax in the 97 same manner as discussed in the previous section relating to the taxation of United States Holders. In addition, in the case of a corporate Non-United States Holder, such holder's earnings and profits that are attributable to the effectively connected income, which are subject to certain adjustments, may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, or at a lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. Backup Withholding and Information Reporting In general, dividend payments, or other taxable distributions, made within the United States to a noncorporate United States holder will be subject to information reporting requirements and backup withholding tax if such holder: fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number; is notified by the IRS that it has failed to report all interest or dividends required to be shown on its federal income tax returns; or in certain circumstances, fails to comply with applicable certification requirements. Non-United States Holders may be required to establish their exemption from information reporting and backup withholding by certifying their status on IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI or W-8IMY, as applicable. If a holder sells our common stock to or through a United States office or broker, the payment of the proceeds is subject to both United States backup withholding and information reporting unless the holder certifies that it is a non-United States person, under penalties of perjury, or the holder otherwise establishes an exemption. If a holder sells our common stock through a non-United States office of a non-United States broker and the sales proceeds are paid outside the United States then information reporting and backup withholding generally will not apply to that payment. However, United States information reporting requirements, but not backup withholding, will apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if that payment is made outside the United States, if a holder sells our common stock through a non-United States office of a broker that is a United States person or has some other contacts with the United States. Backup withholding tax is not an additional tax. Rather, a holder generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under backup withholding rules that exceed such stockholder's income tax liability by filing a refund claim with the IRS.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk In connection with certain of our credit facilities under which we pay a floating rate of interest, we entered into interest rate swap agreements designed to decrease our financing cash outflows by taking advantage of the relatively lower interest rate environment in recent years. We have recognized these derivative instruments on the balance sheet at their fair value. Pursuant to the adoption of our Risk Management Accounting Policy, and after putting in place the formal documentation required by SFAS 133 in order to designate these swaps as hedging instruments, as of June 15, 2006, these interest rate swaps qualified for hedge accounting, and, accordingly, since that time, only hedge ineffectiveness amounts arising from the differences in the change in fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are recognized in our earnings. Assessment and measurement of prospective and retrospective effectiveness for these interest rate swaps are performed on a quarterly basis, on the financial statement and earnings reporting dates. Prior to June 15, 2006, we recognized changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps in current period earnings as these interest rate swap agreements did not qualify as hedging instruments under the requirements in the accounting literature described below because we had not adopted a hedging policy. These changes would occur due to changes in market interest rates for debt with substantially similar credit risk, payment profile and terms. We have not held or issued derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Set forth below is a table of our interest rate swap arrangements converting floating interest rate exposure into fixed as of December 31, 2006 and 2007 (in thousands).

They require that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge, the objective of which is to match the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging derivative with the recognition of (i) the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk or 99 (ii) the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction. For a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change. Fair Value Interest Rate Swap Hedges These interest rate swaps are designed to economically hedge the fair value of the fixed rate loan facilities against fluctuations in the market interest rates by converting its fixed rate loan facilities to floating rate debt. Pursuant to the adoption of our Risk Management Accounting Policy, and after putting in place the formal documentation required by SFAS 133 in order to designate these swaps as hedging instruments, as of June 15, 2006, these interest rate swaps qualified for hedge accounting, and, accordingly, since that time, hedge ineffectiveness amounts arising from the differences in the change in fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are recognized in our earnings. We consider our strategic use of interest rate swaps to be a prudent method of managing interest rate sensitivity, as it prevents earnings from being exposed to undue risk posed by changes in interest rates. Assessment and measurement of prospective and retrospective effectiveness for these interest rate swaps are performed on a quarterly basis, on the financial statement and earnings reporting dates. The interest rate swap agreements converting fixed interest rate exposure into floating, as of December 31, 2006 and 2007 were as follows (In thousands): Counterparty Contract Trade Date Effective Date Termination Date Notional Amount on Effective Date Fixed Rate (Danaos receives) Floating Rate (Danaos pays) Fair Value December 31, 2006 Fair Value December 31, 2007 RBS 11/15/2004 12/15/2004 8/27/2016 $ 60,528 5.0125% p.a. USD LIBOR 3M BBA + 0.835% p.a $ (1,772 ) $ (177 ) RBS 11/15/2004 11/17/2004 2/11/2016 $ 62,342 5.0125% p.a. USD LIBOR 3M BBA + 0.855% p.a $ (1,889 ) $ (244 ) Total fair value $ (3,661 ) $ (421 ) The total fair value change of the interest rate swaps for the year ended December 31, 2007 amounted to $3.2 million and is included in the Statement of Income in Gain/(Loss) on Fair Value of Derivatives. The related liability of $0.4 million is shown under Other Liabilities (long-term) in the Balance Sheet. The total fair value change of the underlying hedged debt for the period from January 1, 2007 until December 31, 2007 amounted to $2.5 million and is included in the Statement of Income in Gain/(Loss) on Fair Value of Derivatives. The net ineffectiveness for December 31, 2007 amounted to $0.8 million and is shown in the Statement of Income under Gain/(Loss) on fair value of derivatives. Cash Flow Interest Rate Swap Hedges We, according to our long-term strategic plan to maintain relative stability in our interest rate exposure, have decided to swap part of our interest expenses from floating to fixed. To this effect, we have entered into 18 interest rate swap transactions with varying start and maturity dates, in order to pro-actively and efficiently manage its floating rate exposure. These interest rate swaps are designed to economically hedge the variability of interest cash flows arising from floating rate debt, attributable to movements in three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR. According to our Risk Management Accounting Policy, and after putting in place the formal documentation required by SFAS 133 in order to designate these swaps as hedging instruments, as from their inception, these interest rate swaps qualified for hedge accounting, and, accordingly, since that time, only hedge ineffectiveness amounts arising from the differences in the change in fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are recognized in our earnings. Assessment and measurement of prospective and retrospective effectiveness for these interest rate swaps are performed on a quarterly 100 basis. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognized initially in shareholders' equity, and recycled to the Statement of Income in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized in the Statement of Income immediately. The total fair value change of the interest rate swaps for the year ended December 31, 2007 amounted to $60.7 million and is included in Other Comprehensive Income. There was no ineffective portion for the period of the hedge. Assuming no changes to our borrowings or hedging instruments after December 31, 2007, a one-percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $1.5 million in earnings and cash flow for 2008 while any change in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements should be neutralized by a corresponding change in "Other Comprehensive Income" as long as our hedging is deemed effective. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We generate all of our revenues in U.S. dollars, but for the year ended December 31, 2007 we incurred approximately 52.0% of our expenses in currencies other than U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 34.2% of our outstanding accounts payable were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (mainly in Euro). We have not entered into derivative instruments to hedge the foreign currency translation of assets or liabilities or foreign currency transactions other than as described below with respect to expected inflows in connection with the leasing transactions with respect to vessels in our fleet and we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. We have recognized these financial instruments on our balance sheet at their fair value. These foreign currency forward contracts did not qualify as hedging instruments until June 30, 2006 and after the restructuring of the leasing arrangements for six vessels in our fleet on October 5, 2007 ceased to qualify as hedging instruments as these leasing arrangements were no longer expected to result in cash inflows, and thus, other than for the period from June 30, 2006 until October 5, 2007, we recognized changes in their fair value in our current period earnings. As of July 1, 2006 these foreign currency forward contracts qualified for hedge accounting and, accordingly, from that time until October 5, 2007, changes in the fair value of these instruments were not recognized in current period earnings. We entered into the foreign currency forward contracts referred to above in 2004 to economically hedge our exposure to fluctuations of anticipated cash inflows in British pounds relating to the leasing arrangements. Under the contracts, we will convert £29.7 million of cash inflows to U.S. dollars at the time of maturity (in the years from 2006 to 2012). The total net fair value change of the forward contracts for the period from January 1, 2007 until October 5, 2007 (end of the hedge) amounted to $0.514 million of which $1.891 million is included in Other Comprehensive Income and the remaining $(1.377) million is shown in the Statement of Income under Gain/(Loss) on fair value of derivatives, out of which the $(0.034) million is the net ineffective portion of the hedge and the remaining $(1.343) million is analyzed as $0.572 million due to expiration of certain contracts on April 14, 2007 and $(1.915) million due to the end of the hedge on October 5, 2007. The total fair value change of the forward contracts for the period from October 5, 2007 (end of the hedge) until December 31, 2007 amounted to $0.434 million and is shown in the Statement of Income under Gain/(Loss) on fair value of derivatives. 101 As of December 31, 2007 we had recorded the fair value of derivative instrument liabilities of $1.402 million in Other liabilities (current) and $56.537 million in Other long-term liabilities. Assuming no changes to our forward contracts after December 31, 2007, a 10% movement in the outright GBP/USD exchange rate would result in a movement of $2.8 million, which would be a loss should the GBP/USD exchange rate move higher (ie. GBP appreciates against the dollar), and a gain should the GBP/USD exchange rate move lower (ie. GBP depreciates against the dollar). In both cases, the effect will go through our Statement of Income. We do not believe that we have significant risk exposure to foreign currency fluctuations relating to our operating expenses. Item 12. Description of Securities Other than Equity Securities Not Applicable. PART II Item 13. Defaults, Dividend Arrearages and Delinquencies Not Applicable. Item 14. Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds Not Applicable. Item 15. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of December 31, 2007. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined under SEC rules as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based on our evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2007. Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 102 the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In making its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, used the criteria set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Management concluded that, as of December 31, 2007, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm PricewaterhouseCoopers S.A, which has audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2007, has also audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as stated in their audit report which is incorporated into Item 18 of this Form 20-F from page F-2 hereof. Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 20-F, we have made no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Item 16A. Audit Committee Financial Expert Our Audit Committee consists of three independent directors, Andrew B. Fogarty, Miklos Konkoly Thege, and Myles R. Itkin, who is the chairman of the committee. Our board of directors has determined that Myles R. Itkin, whose biographical details are included in "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees," qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined under current SEC regulations. Mr. Itkin is a United States Certified Public Accountant and independent in accordance with the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Item 16B. Code of Ethics We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for all officers and employees of our company, a Code of Conduct for the chief executive officer and senior financial officers of our company and a Code of Ethics for directors of our company, copies of which are posted on our website, and may be viewed at http://www.danaos.com. We will also provide a paper copy of these documents free of charge upon written request by our stockholders. Stockholders may direct their requests to the attention of Mr. Evangelos Chatzis, Danaos Corporation, 14 Akti Kondyli, 185 45 103 Piraeus, Greece. No waivers of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the Code of Conduct or the Code of Ethics have been granted to any person during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. Item 16C. Principal Accountant Fees and Services PricewaterhouseCoopers S.A., an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our annual financial statements acting as our independent auditor for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. The chart below sets forth the total amount billed and accrued for the PricewaterhouseCoopers S.A. services performed in 2006 and 2007 and breaks down these amounts by the category of service. (In Thousands) 2006 2007 Audit fees $ 260.0 $ 719.2 Audit-related fees 180.8 103.0 Tax fees 4.6 5.2 Total fees $ 445.4 $ 827.4 Audit Fees Audit fees paid were compensation for professional services rendered for the audits of our consolidated financial statements including audit fees in connection with our initial public offering. Audit-related Fees Audit-related fees for 2007 include audit-related fees in connection with the Registration Statement on Form F-3 (Reg. No. 333-147099), which we filed with the SEC in the fourth quarter of 2007, and audit-related fees for 2006 include audit-related fees in connection with the review of the Registration Statement on Form F-1 (Reg. No. 333-137459), which we filed with the SEC in the second half of 2006. Tax Fees The tax fees in 2006 and 2007 include the aggregate fees billed for certain tax related consultations and other work which are not reported under audit services, including the submission of zero tax returns in Singapore in relation to certain of our vessels owned by Singapore incorporated vessel holding companies. Other Fees PricewaterhouseCoopers S.A. did not provide any other services that would be classified in this category in 2007 or 2006. Pre-approval Policies and Procedures The audit committee charter sets forth our policy regarding retention of the independent auditors, requiring the audit committee to review and approve in advance the retention of the independent auditors for the performance of all audit and lawfully permitted non-audit services and the fees related thereto. The chairman of the audit committee or in the absence of the chairman, any member of the audit committee designated by the chairman, has authority to approve in advance any lawfully permitted non-audit services and fees. The audit committee is authorized to establish other policies and procedures for the pre-approval of such services and fees. Where non-audit services and fees are 104 approved under delegated authority, the action must be reported to the full audit committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee approved all of the non-audit services described above and determined that the provision of such services is compatible with maintaining the independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers S.A.

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in "Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting", appearing in Item 15 of the Company's 2007 Annual Report on Form 20-F. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits (which was an integrated audit in 2007). We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. The Company also consolidates entities that are determined to be variable interest entities as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46(R) if it determines that it is the primary beneficiary. The Company does not have any significant variable interest entities. Inter-company transaction balances and unrealized gains on transactions between the companies are eliminated. Use of Estimates: The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts F-9 DANAOS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2 Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss): The Company follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 130, "Statement of Comprehensive Income", which requires separate presentation of certain transactions, which are recorded directly as components of stockholders' equity. Foreign Currency Translation: The functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. Transactions involving other currencies during the year are converted into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction. On the balance sheet dates, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are translated to reflect the current exchange rates. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of call and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less which are not restricted for use or withdrawal. Restricted Cash: Cash restricted accounts include retention and restricted deposit accounts. Certain of the Company's loan agreements require the Company to deposit one-third of quarterly and one-sixth of the semi-annual principal installments and interest installments, respectively, due on the outstanding loan balance monthly in a retention account. On the rollover settlement date, both principal and interest are paid from the retention account. Accounts Receivable: The amount shown as Accounts Receivable at each balance sheet date includes estimated recoveries from charterers for hire and demurrage billings, net of a provision for doubtful accounts. At each balance sheet date, all potentially uncollectible accounts are assessed individually for purposes of determining the appropriate provision for doubtful accounts. Bad debts are written off in the year in which they are identified. Insurance: Insurance claims represent the claimable expenses, net of deductibles, which are expected to be recovered from insurance companies. Any costs to complete the claims are included in accrued liabilities. The Company accounts for the cost of possible additional call amounts under its insurance arrangements in accordance with SFAS 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," based on the Company's historical experience and the historical experience of the shipping industry. Prepaid Expenses and Inventories: Prepaid expenses consist mainly of insurance expenses, and inventories consist of bunkers, lubricants and provisions remaining on board the vessels at each period end, which are valued at the lower of market value or cost as determined using the weighted average method. Financing Costs: Fees incurred for obtaining new loans are deferred and amortized over the loans' respective repayment periods using the effective interest rate method. These charges are included in the balance sheet line item "Deferred Charges". F-10 DANAOS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2 Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Vessels' Cost: Vessels are stated at cost, which consists of the contract purchase price and any material expenses incurred upon acquisition (improvements and delivery expenses). Subsequent expenditures for conversions and major improvements are also capitalized when they appreciably extend the life, increase the earning capacity or improve the efficiency or safety of the vessels. Otherwise, these expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. Financing costs incurred during the construction period of the vessels are included in vessels' cost. Vessels acquired in the secondhand market are treated as a business combination to the extent that such acquisitions include continuing operations and business characteristics such as management agreements, employees and customer base. Otherwise, these are treated as purchase of assets. Where the Company identifies any intangible assets or liabilities associated with the acquisition of a vessel purchased in the secondhand market, the Company records all identified tangible and intangible assets or liabilities at fair value. Fair value is determined by reference to market data and the discounted amount of expected future cash flows. The Company has acquired certain vessels in the secondhand market, all of which were considered to be acquisitions of assets. Vessels' Depreciation: The cost of the Company's vessels is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the vessels' remaining economic useful lives after considering the estimated residual value. Management has estimated the useful life of the Company's vessels to be 30 years from the year built. Accounting for Special Survey and Drydocking Costs: The Company follows the deferral method of accounting for special survey and drydocking costs, whereby actual costs incurred are deferred and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period until the next scheduled survey, which is two and a half years. If special survey or drydocking is performed prior to the scheduled date, the remaining unamortized balances are immediately written off. The amortization periods reflect the estimated useful economic life of the deferred charge, which is the period between each special survey and drydocking. Impairment of Long-lived Assets: SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets," addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The standard requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used or disposed of by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset's carrying value and fair value. No events or changes in circumstances have occurred in the periods presented that would lead to a review for impairment. Pension and Retirement Benefit Obligations-Crew: The crew on board the companies' vessels serve in such capacity under short-term contracts (usually up to nine months) and accordingly, the vessel-owning companies are not liable for any pension or post retirement benefits. Accounting for Revenue and Expenses: Revenues from time chartering of vessels are accounted for as operating leases and are thus recognized on a straight line basis as the average revenue over the rental periods of such charter agreements, as service is performed. The Company earns revenue from bareboat and time charters. Bareboat and time charters involve placing a vessel at the charterers' F-11 DANAOS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2 Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) disposal for a period of time during which the charterer uses the vessel in return for the payment of a specified daily hire rate. Under a time charter, the daily hire rate includes the crew, lubricants, insurance, spares and stores. Under a bareboat charter, the charterer is provided only with the vessel. General and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses include management fees paid to the vessels' manager (see note 14), audit fees, legal fees, board remuneration, director's & officers insurance and stock exchange fees. Repairs and Maintenance: All repair and maintenance expenses including major overhauling and underwater inspection expenses are charged against income when incurred and are included in vessel operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Dividends: Dividends are recorded in the Company's financial statements in the period in which they are declared by the Company's board of directors. Segment Reporting: The Company reports financial information and evaluates its operations by total charter revenues. Although revenue can be identified for different types of charters, management does not identify expenses, profitability or other financial information for different charters. As a result, management, including the chief operating decision maker, reviews operating results solely by revenue per day and operating results of the fleet, and thus the Company has determined that it has only one operating and reportable segment. Derivative Instruments: The Company enters into interest rate swap contracts and forward exchange rate contracts to create economic hedges for its interest rate risks and its exposure to currency exchange risk on certain foreign currency receivables. When such derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", the Company presents these financial instruments at their fair value, and recognizes the fair value changes thereto in the Statement of Income. When the derivatives do qualify for hedge accounting, depending upon the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the fair value of assets, liabilities or firm commitments through income, or recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (effective portion) until the hedged item is recognized in income. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is immediately recognized in income. Earnings Per Share: The Company has presented net income per share for all periods presented based on the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock of Danaos Corporation at the reported periods. There are no dilutive or potentially dilutive securities, accordingly there is no difference between basic and diluted net income per share. Equity Compensation Plan: The Company has adopted an equity compensation plan (the "Plan"), which is generally administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors. The Plan allows the plan administrator to grant awards of shares of common stock or the right to receive or purchase shares of common stock to employees, directors or other persons or entities providing significant services to the Company or its subsidiaries. The actual terms of an award will be determined by the plan administrator and set forth in written award agreement with the participant. Any options granted under the Plan will be accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123(R). F-12 DANAOS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2 Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The aggregate number of shares of common stock for which awards may be granted under the Plan cannot exceed 6% of the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding at the time any award is granted. Awards made under the Plan that have been forfeited or cancelled or have expired, will not be treated as having been granted for purposes of the preceding sentence. Unless otherwise set forth in an award agreement, any awards outstanding under the Plan will vest upon a "change of control", as defined in the Plan. The Plan will automatically terminate ten years after it has been most recently approved by our stockholders. To date, no grants or stock options have been issued under the equity compensation plan. Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The statement clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or transfer a liability at the measurement date. The statement emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement and not an entity-specific measurement. It also establishes a fair value hierarchy used in fair value measurements and expands the required disclosures of assets and liabilities measured at fair value. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, of the adoption of FAS 157 on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115", ("FAS 159") which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. FAS 159 provides entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. FAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity's fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, of the adoption of FAS 159 on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007) "Business Combinations" ("FAS 141R"), which replaces FASB Statement No. 141. FAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. The Statement also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. FAS 141R is effective as the beginning of an entity's fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008, which will be the Company's year beginning January 1, 2009. The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, of the adoption of FAS 141R on Company's consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 "Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statement-amendments of ARB No. 51" (FAS 160). FAS 160 states that accounting and F-13 DANAOS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2 Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) reporting for minority interests will be recharacterized as non-controlling interests and classified as a component of equity. The Statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non-controlling owners. FAS 160 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, except not-for-profit organizations, but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding non-controlling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2008, which corresponds to the Company's year beginning January 1, 2009. The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, of the adoption of FAS 160 on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standard Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161 (SFAS 161) "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activitiesan amendment of FASB Statement No. 133". SFAS 161 changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why and entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. This statement encourages, but does not require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 161 on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 3 Restricted Cash Restricted cash was comprised as follows: Retention Restricted Deposits Total December 31, 2006 $ 2,493  $ 2,493 December 31, 2007 $ 4,557 $ 41,622 * $ 46,179 *This amount represents cash collateral placed in two restricted accounts.

The Company did not account for the transactions as sale and lease-backs because the consideration for the vessels was not under the Company's control. Accordingly, the vessels continued to be recognized in the Company's books along with the external bank debt used to finance the initial acquisition. The Company reduced the cost basis of the vessels and hulls at inception with the present value of the future cash inflows amounting to $59.6 million (£31.9 million), $32.3 million and $27.3 million for the vessels and for the hulls, respectively, and recognized this amount as a receivable F-21 DANAOS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 12 Lease Arrangements (Continued) in respect of the lease arrangements. The receivable balance was being reduced by the actual cash inflows over the 61/2 year term. The discount rates used in the present value calculation ranged from 4.2% to 4.9%, reflecting the GBP applicable interest rate at the time of the inception of the transactions. As a result of a change in U.K. law enacted in 2006, the Company estimated that the cash benefits initially expected to be derived from this structure would eventually be paid back and, accordingly, reinstated the original book basis of the acquired vessels, recognized a liability for the net proceeds received by the Company reflecting periodic cash benefits received and recognized an incremental liability of $12.8 million, which was recorded as an expense. As a result of a restructuring in October 2007, the Company no longer expects to have to pay back any amounts as previously evaluated due to the 2006 change in U.K. law. As a result, the Company now expects to retain the cash benefits of $29.3 million received to date. Accordingly, the liability for cumulative net periodic distributions received in the form of cash benefits was reversed and recorded as a reduction of the book basis of the vessels. In addition, the incremental liability of $12.8 million, which was recorded as expense in 2006, was reversed and recognized in earnings in 2007, and is included within Other income (expenses), net. On March 7, 2008, the Company exercised its right to arrange the sale of the vessels subject to their respective leasing arrangements to 100% owned subsidiaries of the Company. b) Charters-out: The future minimum revenue, expected to be earned on non-cancelable time charters is as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2007 2008 $ 298,115 2009 333,568 2010 446,183 2011 564,142 2012 586,364 Thereafter 5,030,827 Total future revenue $ 7,259,199 Revenues from time charter are not generally received when a vessel is off-hire, including time required for normal periodic maintenance of the vessel. In arriving at the minimum future charter revenues, an estimated time off-hire to perform periodic maintenance on each vessel has been deducted, although there is no assurance that such estimate will be reflective of the actual off-hire in the future. The off-hire assumptions used relate mainly to drydocking and special survey maintenance carried out approximately every 2.5 years per vessel and which may last 10-15 days.

This revolving credit facility shall be non-amortizing for the first five years and the repayment schedule as well as the balloon will be determined based upon the weighted average age of the vessels that will comprise the securities portfolio for this loan at the end of the fifth year (i.e., November 14, 2011). c)The annual repayments of the above loans, net of current maturities, as of December 31, 2007, were as follows: December 31, 2007 2009 25,619 2010 25,619 2011 25,619 Thereafter 1,249,287 Total long-term debt $ 1,326,144 d)All of the loans referred to in paragraph (a) above are collateralized by first and second preferred mortgages over the vessels financed, general assignment of all hire freights, income and earnings, the assignment of their insurance policies, as well as any proceeds from the sale of mortgaged vessels and the corporate guarantee of Danaos Corporation. e)The loan agreements also include positive and negative covenants for the Company, the most significant of which are the maintenance of operating accounts, minimum cash deposits and minimum market values. The borrowers are further restricted from incurring additional indebtedness and changing the vessels' flags without the prior consent of the lender. In addition, the Company must maintain the following financial covenants: a market value adjusted net worth of at least $400.0 million and stockholders' equity of at least $250.0 million; F-25 DANAOS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 13 Long Term Debt (Continued) the aggregate market value of the vessels exceeds 145.0% of the Company net consolidated debt at all times; adjusted stockholders' equity in excess of 30.0% of the Company total market value adjusted assets; the outstanding bank debt does not exceed 75.0% of the aggregate value of the vessels mortgaged under the relevant credit facility; the total liabilities (after deducting cash and cash equivalents), of no more than 70.0% of the total market value adjusted assets; the aggregate cash and cash equivalents of no less than the higher of (a) $30 million and (b) 3% of the Company total indebtedness until November 14, 2011 and 4% of the Company total indebtedness at all times thereafter; and a ratio of EBITDA to net interest expense of no less than 2.5 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with each of these financial ratio requirements and financial covenants. f)The weighted average effective interest rate on long-term borrowings for the periods ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was 5.6%. 14 Related Party Transactions Management Services: Pursuant to a ship management agreement between each of the vessel owning companies and Danaos Shipping Company Limited (the "Manager"), the Manager acts as the fleet's technical manager responsible for (i) recruiting qualified officers and crews, (ii) managing day to day vessel operations and relationships with charterers, (iii) purchasing of stores, supplies and new equipment for the vessels, (iv) performing general vessel maintenance, reconditioning and repair, including commissioning and supervision of shipyards and subcontractors of drydock facilities required for such work, (v) ensuring regulatory and classification society compliance, (vi) performing operational budgeting and evaluation, (vii) arranging financing for vessels and (viii) providing accounting, treasury and finance services and (ix) providing information technology software and hardware in the support of the Company's processes. The Manager is a common controlled entity. Prior to July 1, 2005, the Company paid its manager a monthly management fee of $2,750 for the management of its affairs. The Company also paid a fixed management fee of $150 to $500 per day for each vessel in its fleet depending on its size and type of charterparty. As of July 1, 2005, the new management contract provides for a fee of $500 per day. In addition, the manager receives a management fee of $250 per vessel per day for vessels on bareboat charter and $500 per vessel per day for the remaining vessels in the fleet, pro rated for the calendar days each vessel is owned. The manager also receives a commission of 0.75% on gross freight, charter hire, ballast bonus and demurrage with respect to each vessel in the fleet and a commission of 0.5% based on the contract price of any vessel bought or sold by the manager on its behalf (excluding newbuildings), and a flat fee of $400,000 per newbuilding vessel for the supervision of newbuilding contracts. F-26 DANAOS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 14 Related Party Transactions (Continued) For the services rendered, the Manager charged each vessel a daily fee ranging from $250 to $500. Management fees in 2007 amounted to approximately $5.7 million from continuing operations (2006: $4.6 million, 2005: $3.9 million). The related expenses are shown under General and administrative expenses on the Statement of Income. The Company pays monthly advances on account of the above management fees. These prepaid management fees are presented in the Balance sheet under "Due from related parties". Dr. John Coustas, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, is a member of the Board of Directors of The Swedish Club, the primary provider of insurance for the Company, including a substantial portion of its hull & machinery, war risk and protection and indemnity insurance. Seasonal Maritime Corporation, an entity wholly-owned by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, funded $30.4 million of the $40.5 million acquisition price of the MOL Confidence under a loan agreement, dated March 14, 2006, among Seasonal Maritime Corporation, as lender, a subsidiary of the Company, as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor. The interest rate for this loan was LIBOR plus 1.0% per annum, with a maturity date of six months after execution of the loan agreement, subject to an option for an additional six months repayment term for the borrower. In addition, a flat fee of $70,125 was paid upon execution of the loan agreement and a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum was payable quarterly on any undrawn amount, commencing March 14, 2006. On June 16, 2006, the Company repaid $25.4 million of the amount borrowed under this loan agreement, leaving $5.0 million outstanding as of June 30, 2006, which amount was repaid in August 2006. This loan was secured by a general assignment of income from the MOL Confidence and an assignment of insurance receivables with respect to the vessel. The Company repaid the entire amount outstanding under this loan on December 28, 2006 with borrowings made under the credit facility with Aegean Baltic-HSH Nordbank and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The fees and interest paid under these loan agreements were no less favorable than those the Company could have obtained in arm's-length negotiations with an unrelated third party. Until May 2006, Mr. Miklós Konkoly-Thege, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, was President and Chairman of the Executive Board of Det Norske Veritas, which provides vessel classification services to the Company. 15 Taxes Under the laws of the countries of the Company's ship owning subsidiaries' incorporation and/or vessels' registration, the Company's ship operating subsidiaries are not subject to tax on international shipping income, however, they are subject to registration and tonnage taxes, which have been included in Vessel Operating Expenses in the accompanying consolidated Statements of Income. Pursuant to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), U.S.-source income from the international operation of ships is generally exempt from U.S. tax if the company operating the ships meets certain requirements. Among other things, in order to qualify for this exemption, the company operating the ships must be incorporated in a country which grants an equivalent exemption from income taxes to U.S. corporations. F-27 DANAOS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 15 Taxes (Continued) All of the Company's ship-operating subsidiaries satisfy these initial criteria. In addition, these companies must be more than 50% owned by individuals who are residents, as defined, in the countries of incorporation or another foreign country that grants an equivalent exemption to U.S. corporations. These companies also currently satisfy the more than 50% beneficial ownership requirement. In addition, should the beneficial ownership requirement not be met, the management of the Company believes that by virtue of a special rule applicable to situations where the ship operating companies are beneficially owned by a publicly traded company like the Company, the more than 50% beneficial ownership requirement can also be satisfied based on the trading volume and the anticipated widely-held ownership of the Company's shares, but no assurance can be given that this will remain so in the future, since continued compliance with this rule is subject to factors outside of the Company's control. 16 Financial Instruments The principal financial assets of the Company consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other assets. The principal financial liabilities of the Company consist of long-term bank loans, accounts payable and derivatives. Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk arises on bank borrowings. The Company monitors the interest rate on borrowings closely to ensure that the borrowings are maintained at favorable rates. The interest rates relating to the long-term loans are disclosed in note 13. Concentration of Credit Risk: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, trade accounts receivable and derivatives. The Company places its temporary cash investments, consisting mostly of deposits, with high credit qualified financial institutions. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of those financial institutions that are considered in the Company's investment strategy. The Company does not require collateral on these financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to derivative instruments, however, the Company limits this exposure by diversifying among counterparties with high credit ratings. Credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the Company's charterer base and their dispersion across many geographic areas. The Company's maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying value of its derivative instruments. The Company is not a party to master netting arrangements. Fair Value: The carrying amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of financial assets and liabilities excluding long-term bank loans approximate their respective fair values due to the short maturity of these instruments. The fair values of long-term floating rate bank loans approximate the recorded values, generally due to their variable interest rates. The carrying amount of fixed rate bank loans is adjusted by the gain or loss on the debt attributable to the hedged risk. The fair value of the swap agreements equals the amount that would be paid by the Company to cancel the swaps. Interest Rate Swaps: The off-balance sheet risk in outstanding swap agreements involves both the risk of a counter-party not performing under the terms of the contract and the risk associated with changes in market value. The Company monitors its positions, the credit ratings of counterparties and the level of contracts it enters into with any one party. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. The Company has a policy of entering into contracts with parties that meet F-28 DANAOS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 16 Financial Instruments (Continued) stringent qualifications and, given the high level of credit quality of its derivative counter-parties, the Company does not believe it is necessary to obtain collateral arrangements. a.Cash Flow Interest Rate Swap Hedges The company, according to its long-term strategic plan to maintain relative stability in its interest rate exposure, has decided to swap part of its interest expenses from floating to fixed. To this effect, the company has entered into interest rate swap transactions with varying start and maturity dates, in order to pro-actively and efficiently manage its floating rate exposure. These interest rate swaps are designed to economically hedge the variability of interest cash flows arising from floating rate debt, attributable to movements in three-month USD$LIBOR. According to the Company's Risk Management Accounting Policy, and after putting in place the formal documentation required by SFAS 133 in order to designate these swaps as hedging instruments, as from their inception, these interest rate swaps qualified for hedge accounting, and, accordingly, since that time, only hedge ineffectiveness amounts arising from the differences in the change in fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are recognized in the Company's earnings. Assessment and measurement of prospective and retrospective effectiveness for these interest rate swaps are being performed on a quarterly basis. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognized initially in shareholders' equity, and recognized to the Statement of Income in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized in the Statement of Income immediately.

There was no ineffective portion for the period of the hedge. b.Fair Value Interest Rate Swap Hedges These interest rate swaps are designed to economically hedge the fair value of the fixed rate loan facilities against fluctuations in the market interest rates by converting its fixed rate loan facilities to floating rate debt. Pursuant to the adoption of the Company's Risk Management Accounting Policy, and after putting in place the formal documentation required by SFAS 133 in order to designate these swaps as hedging instruments, as of June 15, 2006, these interest rate swaps qualified for hedge accounting, and, accordingly, since that time, hedge ineffectiveness amounts arising from the differences in the change in fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are recognized in the Company's earnings. The Company considers its strategic use of interest rate swaps to be a prudent method of managing interest rate sensitivity, as it prevents earnings from being exposed to undue risk posed by changes in interest rates. Assessment and measurement of prospective and retrospective effectiveness for these interest rate swaps are being performed on a quarterly basis, on the financial statement and earnings reporting dates. F-30 DANAOS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 16 Financial Instruments (Continued) The interest rate swap agreements converting fixed interest rate exposure into floating, as of December 31, 2007, were as follows: Counter party Contract trade Date Effective Date Termination Date Notional Amount on Effective Date Fixed Rate (Danaos receives) Floating Rate (Danaos pays) Fair Value December 31, 2006 Fair Value December 31, 2007 RBS 11/15/2004 12/15/2004 8/27/2016 $ 60,528 5.0125 p.a. % USD LIBOR 3M BBA + 0.835% p.a $ (1,772 ) $ (177 ) RBS 11/15/2004 11/17/2004 2/11/2016 $ 62,342 5.0125 p.a. % USD LIBOR 3M BBA + 0.855% p.a $ (1,889 ) $ (244 ) Total fair value $ (3,661 ) $ (421 ) The total fair value change of the interest rate swaps for the period from January 1, 2007 until December 31, 2007, amounted to $3,240, and is included in the Statement of Income in Gain/(Loss) on Fair Value of Derivatives. The related liability of $421 is shown under Other Liabilities (long-term) in the Balance Sheet. The total fair value change of the underlying hedged debt for the period from January 1, 2007, until December 31, 2007, amounted to $2,490 and is included in the Statement of Income in Gain/(Loss) on Fair Value of Derivatives. The net ineffectiveness for December 31, 2007, amounted to $750 and is shown in the Statement of Income under Gain/(Loss) on fair value of derivatives. c.Foreign Currency Forward ContractsCash Flow Hedges The Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts in 2004 to economically hedge its exposure to fluctuations of its anticipated cash inflows in U.K. pounds relating to certain lease arrangements as explained in note 12. Under the contracts the Company will convert £29.7 million of cash inflows to U.S. dollars at the time of maturity (in the years from 2006 to 2012). Pursuant to the adoption of the Company's Risk Management Accounting Policy, and after putting in place the formal documentation required by SFAS 133 in order to designate these forwards as hedging instruments, as of June 30, 2006, these foreign exchange forwards qualified for hedge accounting, and, accordingly, since that time, only hedge ineffectiveness amounts arising from the differences in the change in fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are recognized in the Company's earnings. Assessment and measurement of prospective and retrospective effectiveness for these interest rate swaps are being performed on a quarterly basis. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognized initially in shareholders' equity, and recycled to the Statement of Income in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized in the Statement of Income immediately. The total net fair value change of the forward contracts for the period from January 1, 2007 until October 5, 2007 (end of the hedge) amounted to $514 of which $1,891 is included in Other Comprehensive Income and the remaining $(1,377) is shown in the Statement of Income under Gain/(Loss) on fair value of derivatives, out of which the $(34) is the net ineffective portion of the hedge and the remaining $(1,343) is analyzed as $572 due to expiration of certain contracts on April 14, 2007 and $(1,915) due to the end of the hedge on October 5, 2007. The total fair value change of the forward contracts for the period from October 5, 2007 (end of the hedge) until December 31, 2007 F-31 DANAOS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 16 Financial Instruments (Continued) amounted to $434 and is shown in the Statement of Income under Gain/(Loss) on fair value of derivatives. As of December 31, 2007 the Company has recorded the fair value of derivative instrument liabilities of $1,402 in Other liabilities (current) and $56,537 in Other long-term liabilities. 17 Operating Revenue Revenue from significant customers (constituting more than 10% of total revenue), are as follows: Year ended December 31, Charterer 2005 2006 2007 APL 21 % 18 % Under 10 % HMM Korea Under 10 % 11 % 13 % CSCL 12 % 13 % 18 % CMA CGM 11 % 11 % 13 % YML Under 10 % Under 10 % 11 % WAI HAI LINES 10 % Under 10 % Under 10 % 18 Revenue by Geographic Location Year ended December 31, Continent 2005 2006 2007 AUSTRALASIA $ 123,742 $ 136,674 $ 154,467 AMERICA   1,494 EUROPE 52,144 68,503 102,884 Total Revenue $ 175,886 $ 205,177 $ 258,845 F-32 DANAOS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 19 Commitments and Contingencies Commitments The Company, as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, had outstanding commitments of approximately $2,726.3 million and $790.0 million respectively for the construction of container vessels as follows: Vessels TEU Contract Price Outstanding Commitments as of December 31, 2006 Outstanding Commitments as of December 31, 2007 YM Seattle 4,253 $ 70,000 $ 49,000  Hull 1640 4,253 $ 70,000 $ 56,000  Hull 1670 4,253 $ 63,800 $ 51,040 $ 44,660 Hull 1671 4,253 $ 63,800 $ 51,040 $ 51,040 Hull 1672 4,253 $ 63,800 $ 51,040 $ 51,040 Hull 1673 4,253 $ 63,800 $ 51,040 $ 51,040 Hull 1698 4,253 $ 63,800 $ 57,420 $ 51,040 Hull 1699 4,253 $ 63,800 $ 57,420 $ 51,040 Hull S4001 6,500 $ 91,500 $ 73,200 $ 73,200 Hull S4002 6,500 $ 91,500 $ 73,200 $ 73,200 Hull S4003 6,500 $ 91,500 $ 73,200 $ 73,200 Hull S4004 6,500 $ 91,500 $ 73,200 $ 73,200 Hull S4005 6,500 $ 91,500 $ 73,200 $ 73,200 Hull N-214 6,500 $ 99,000  $ 79,200 Hull N-215 6,500 $ 99,000  $ 79,200 Hull N-216 6,500 $ 99,000  $ 79,200 Hull N-217 6,500 $ 99,000  $ 79,200 Hull N-218 6,500 $ 99,000  $ 79,200 Hull N-219 3,400 $ 55,880  $ 39,116 Hull N-220 3,400 $ 55,880  $ 39,116 Hull N-221 3,400 $ 55,880  $ 39,116 Hull N-222 3,400 $ 55,880  $ 39,116 Hull N-223 3,400 $ 55,880  $ 39,116 Hull Z00001 8,530 $ 113,000  $ 90,400 Hull Z00002 8,530 $ 113,000  $ 90,400 Hull Z00003 8,530 $ 113,000  $ 90,400 Hull Z00004 8,530 $ 113,000  $ 90,400 Hull S-456 12,600 $ 166,166  $ 132,933 Hull S-457 12,600 $ 166,166  $ 132,933 Hull S-458 12,600 $ 166,166  $ 132,933 Hull S-461 10,100 $ 145,240  $ 116,192 Hull S-462 10,100 $ 145,240  $ 116,192 Hull S-463 10,100 $ 145,240  $ 116,192 Hull S-459 12,600 $ 166,166  $ 132,933 Hull S-460 12,600 $ 166,166  $ 132,933 Hull 1022A 8,530 $ 117,500  $ 94,000 251,974 $ 3,590,750 $ 790,000 $ 2,726,280 F-33 DANAOS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 19 Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) Contingencies The Company entered into a guarantee facility agreement with HSH Nordbank on April 20, 2007, by which the Bank issued a performance guarantee for $148 million, guaranteeing certain future payments to Shanghai Jiangnan Changxing Heavy Industry Company Ltd shipyard, regarding relevant shipbuilding contracts between the Company and the shipyard for the construction of 4 vessels.
