D. Risk Factors. Some of our major products are subject to government price controls, and we are not able to pass on all cost increases from rising crude oil prices through higher product prices. We consume large amounts of crude oil to manufacture our products. While we try to pass on crude oil cost increases with sales price increases, our ability to pass on cost increases to our customers is dependent on market conditions and government regulations. In particular, our major petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and LPG are subject to government price controls. In 2005, 2006 and 2007, approximately 58% and 53.96% and 54.06% of our net sales were from products subject to price controls. In 2007, our production costs in RMB terms increased slightly due to the fact that the price of crude oil on the international market continues to rise to record prices. The cost of crude oil accounted for 65.45% of our total cost of sales in 2007, and the average processing costs for crude oil increased by 2.26% compared to 2006. Moreover, the Chinese government controls the distribution of many petroleum products in China. Some of our petroleum products must be sold to designated customers such as the subsidiaries of China Petrochemical Corporation, and we cannot freely sell our petroleum products to take advantage of opportunities for higher prices. Therefore, in periods of high crude oil 3 Table of Contents prices, such as now, we may not be able to fully cover increases in crude oil prices by increases in the sale prices of our petroleum products, which has had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our operations may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the petroleum and petrochemical market and by the volatility of prices of crude oil and refined oil products. Most of our revenues are attributable to petrochemical products, which have historically been cyclical and sensitive to the availability and price of feedstocks and general economic conditions. Markets for many of our products are sensitive to changes in industry capacity and output levels, cyclical changes in regional and global economic conditions, the price and availability of substitute products and changes in consumer demand, which from time to time have had a significant impact on product prices in the regional and global markets. Historically, the markets for these products have experienced alternating periods of tight supply, causing prices and margins to increase, followed by periods of capacity additions, possibly resulting in oversupply and declining prices and margins. As tariffs and other import restrictions are reduced and the control of product allocation and pricing is relaxed in China, the markets for many of our products have become increasingly subject to the cyclicality of regional and global markets. Historically, international prices of crude oil have fluctuated widely due to many other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that future growth in demand for our products will be sufficient to alleviate any existing or future conditions of excess industry capacity or that such conditions will not be sustained or further aggravated by anticipated or unanticipated capacity additions or other events. In addition, we expect that the volatility and uncertainty of the prices of crude oil and petrochemical products will continue. Increasing crude oil prices and declines in prices of petrochemical products may adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition. Our development plans have significant capital expenditure and financing requirements, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The petrochemical business is a capital intensive business. Our ability to maintain and increase our revenues, net income and cash flows depends upon continued capital spending. Our current business strategy contemplates capital expenditures for 2008 of approximately RMB2.5 billion (US$342.72 million), which will be provided through financing activities and use of our own capital. Our actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from these planned amounts due to our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, investments and other factors that may be beyond our control. In addition, there can be no assurance as to whether, or at what cost, our capital projects will be completed or the success of these projects if completed. As of March 31, 2008, we had aggregate outstanding indebtedness of approximately RMB4,528 million (US$620.73 million). China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec Corp), our controlling shareholder, did not provide any guarantee or credit support for our debt for the year ended December 31, 2007 and for the three-month period ended March 31, 2008. Our ability to obtain external financing in the future is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including:  our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows;  the condition of the economy in China and the markets for our products;  the cost of financing and the condition of financial markets; and  the issuance of relevant government approvals and other project risks associated with the development of infrastructure in China. If we fail to obtain sufficient funding for our operations or development plans, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 4 Table of Contents We could face increased competition. Our principal market, Eastern China, which comprises of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and Jiangxi, has enjoyed stronger economic growth and a higher demand for petrochemical products than other regions of China. As a result, we believe that competitors will try to expand their sales and build up their distribution networks in our principal market. We believe this trend will continue and probably accelerate. Increased competition may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Related party transactions; non-competition; conflicts of interests. We have engaged from time to time and will continue to engage in a variety of transactions with Sinopec Corp and China Petrochemical Corporation, the controlling shareholder of Sinopec Corp, and their various subsidiaries or affiliates who provide a number of services to us, including sales and marketing, educational and community services. Our transactions with these companies are governed by a number of service and other contracts, the terms of which were negotiated on an arms length basis. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if Sinopec Corp refuses to engage in such transactions or if it seeks to amend our contracts with it in a way adverse to us. In addition, Sinopec Corp has interests in businesses which compete or are likely to compete, either directly or indirectly, with our businesses. Because Sinopec Corp is our controlling shareholder and its interests may conflict with our own interests, Sinopec Corp may take actions that favor itself over our interests. We are controlled by Sinopec Corp, whose interests may not be aligned with yours. As of June 1, 2008, Sinopec Corp owned 55.56% of our shares. Accordingly, it has voting and management control over us, and its interests may be different from your interests and the interests of our other shareholders. Subject to our Articles of Association and applicable laws and regulations, Sinopec Corp will be in a position to cause us to declare dividends, determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval or effect corporate transactions without the approval of the holders of the H shares and ADSs. Any such increase in our dividend payout would reduce funds available for reinvestment in our business and any such actions or transactions could adversely affect us or our minority shareholders. Additionally, Sinopec Corp completed its initial public offering of shares in late 2000. As a public company, Sinopec Corp may experience changes in its own business strategy and policies. Although we are not currently aware of any such changes, they could, in turn, lead Sinopec Corp to change its policies or practices toward us in ways that we cannot predict, with corresponding unpredictable consequences for our business. Our business operations may be adversely affected by present or future environmental regulations. We are subject to extensive environmental protection laws and regulations in China. These laws and regulations permit:  the imposition of fees and penalties for the discharge of waste substances;  the levy of fines and payments for damages for environmental offenses; and  the government to close or suspend any facility which fails to comply with orders and require it to correct or stop operations causing environmental damage. Our production operations produce substantial amounts of waste materials. In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and revocation. We believe that our operations substantially comply with all applicable Chinese environmental laws and regulations as they have been previously interpreted and enforced. The Chinese government, however, has moved, and may move further, toward more rigorous enforcement of applicable laws, and toward the adoption of more stringent environmental standards. There can be no assurance that Chinese national or local authorities will not impose additional regulations or apply more rigorous enforcement of such regulations which would require additional expenditures on environmental matters. 5 Table of Contents Our business may be limited or adversely affected by government regulations. The central and local Chinese governments continue to exercise a certain degree of control over the petrochemical industry in China by, among other things:  mandating distribution channels for our petroleum products;  setting the allocations and pricing of certain resources, products and services;  assessing taxes and fees payable;  setting import and export quotas and procedures; and  setting safety, environmental and quality standards. As a result, we may face significant constraints on our flexibility and ability to expand our business operations or to maximize our profitability. In the past, we have benefited from favorable regulatory policies that have, for example, reduced the competition we face from illegal imports of petroleum products. Existing policies that favor our industry may change in the future and our business could be adversely affected by any such changes. Our development plans may require regulatory approval. We are currently engaged in a number of construction and expansion projects. Most of our projects are subject to governmental review and approval. The timing and cost of completion of these projects will depend on numerous factors, including approvals from relevant government authorities and general economic conditions in China. While in general we attempt to obtain governmental approval as far in advance as practicable, we may not be able to control the timing and outcome of these governmental reviews and approvals. If any of our important projects required for our future growth are not approved, or not approved on a timely basis, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization, or WTO, may significantly increase foreign competition in our lines of business. China joined the WTO on December 11, 2001. As part of its membership, China has committed to eliminate some tariff and non-tariff barriers to foreign competition in the domestic petrochemical industry that benefited us in the past. In particular, China:  has reduced tariffs on imported petrochemicals products that compete with ours from 5% to 17% to 0% to 14%;  increased levels of permitted foreign investment in the domestic petrochemicals industry, allowing foreign investors to own 100% of a domestic petrochemicals company from December 11, 2004;  has gradually relaxed restrictions on the import of crude oil by non-state owned companies;  has granted foreign-owned companies the right to import petrochemical products; and  has permitted foreign-owned companies to distribute and market petroleum products in both retail and wholesale markets in China. As a result of these measures, we face increased competition from foreign companies and imports. Overall, we think that Chinas WTO entry also creates substantial amounts of new investment and business in China, with a potential increase in sales opportunities for us. We do, however, believe that our products have been and will continue generally to be competitive with imported products in the PRC. Tariff reductions, however, could reduce our profit margins or otherwise negatively impact our revenue from certain products, including a small 6 Table of Contents number of significant products. The PRC government may also reduce the tariffs imposed on production equipment that we may import in the future, as well as the restrictions on availability of imported raw materials (such as crude oil) currently enforced by the government. Although we believe that Chinas accession to the WTO may provide us with opportunities to increase our sales, we cannot be certain of its effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we believe that major international petrochemical companies are preparing to enter the Chinese market amid industry restructuring on a global basis. Apart from posing direct competition against us in petroleum and petrochemical products, these international companies are characterized by large-scale investments across different sectors, full vertical integration and streamlined organization. We expect that domestic companies will face intense competition from their international counterparts as the China market becomes increasingly internationalized. Political and economic policies in China could affect our business in unpredictable ways. The economy of China differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in a number of respects, including:  structure;  level of government involvement;  level of development;  level of capital reinvestment;  control of foreign exchange; and  allocation of resources. Before its adoption of reform and open-door policies beginning in 1978, China was primarily a planned economy. Since that time, the Chinese government has been reforming the Chinese economic system, and has also begun reforming the government structure. These reforms have resulted in significant economic growth and social progress. Although the Chinese government still owns a significant portion of the productive assets in China, economic reform policies since the late 1980s have emphasized autonomous enterprises and the utilization of market mechanisms. We currently expect that the Chinese government will continue these reforms, further reduce government intervention and rely more heavily on market mechanisms to allocate resources. Although we believe these reforms will have a positive effect on our overall long-term development, we cannot predict whether changes to Chinas political, economic and social conditions, laws, regulations and policies will have any adverse effect on our current or future business or results of operations. If the Chinese government changes current regulations that allow us to make payments in foreign currencies, we may be unable to obtain the foreign currency which is necessary for our business. The Renminbi currently is not a freely convertible currency. We receive most of our revenue in Renminbi. A portion of our Renminbi revenue must be converted into other currencies to meet our foreign currency obligations. We have substantial requirements for foreign currency, including:  debt service costs on foreign currency-denominated debt;  purchases of imported equipment;  payment of any cash dividends declared in respect of the H shares; and  import of crude oil and other materials. Under existing foreign exchange regulations in China, we may undertake current account foreign exchange transactions, including the payment of dividends, without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange by producing commercial documents evidencing the foreign exchange transactions, provided that they are processed through Chinese banks licensed to engage in foreign exchange transactions. The Chinese 7 Table of Contents government has stated publicly that it intends to eventually make the Renminbi freely convertible in the future. However, uncertainty exists as to whether the Chinese government may restrict access to foreign currency for current account transactions if foreign currency becomes scarce in China. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account (international revenues and expenditures that increase or decrease debt or equity, including principal payments in respect of foreign currency-denominated obligations) continue to be subject to limitations and require the prior approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. These limitations could affect our ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt financing, or to make capital expenditures in foreign currency. If the Chinese government restricts our ability to make payments in foreign currency, we may be unable to obtain the foreign currency which is necessary for our business. In that case, our business may be materially adversely affected, and we may default on our obligations. Changes in the PRC governments currency policy and fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi may adversely affect our business and operating results. The value of the Renminbi against the US dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in Chinas political and economic conditions. Historically, the Peoples Bank of China has set the conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including US dollars. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government significantly changed its policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the US dollar by permitting the Renminbi to fluctuate within a certain band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. Since the adoption of this new policy, the value of Renminbi against the US dollar has fluctuated daily. Due to the devaluation of the US dollar and other reasons, the value of the Renminbi against the US dollar increased in 2007. In addition, the PRC government continues to receive significant international pressure to further liberalize its exchange rate policy and as a result may further change its currency policy. A small portion of our cash and cash equivalents is denominated in foreign currencies, including the US dollar. Any increase in value of the Renminbi against other currencies, including the US dollar, may decrease the Renminbi value of our cash and cash equivalents that are denominated in foreign currencies. On the other hand, most of our revenues are denominated in Renminbi but a major part of our procurement of crude oil and certain equipment as well as certain debt repayments are denominated in foreign currencies. Any devaluation of the Renminbi in the future will increase our costs and jeopardize our profitability. Any devaluation of the Renminbi may also have an adverse impact on the value of dividends payable in foreign currencies by the Company for H shares and ADSs. Changes in PRC tax laws may affect our business and operating results. In June 2007, the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice requesting local tax authorities to immediately cease the implementation of certain preferential tax treatment which was granted to nine joint stock enterprises approved by the State Council in 1993 to offer shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on the basis that such treatment had expired on 31 December, 1997. The notice further required that any difference in the past financial years between the enterprise income tax calculated based on the preferential tax rates that had expired and that calculated based on the applicable regular tax rates should be subject to the PRC Law on Tax Administration and Collection. We are one of the nine joint stock enterprises and had enjoyed a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15%. In August 2007, we were notified by the Shanghai tax authorities that from 2007, our income tax rate would be adjusted from the original 15% to 33% with effect from 2007. We currently are unable to determine whether the relevant tax authorities will request payment of the difference in the income taxes for the previous years, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the outcome and the risks associated with this matter. With the implementation of the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC, effective January 1, 2008, our income tax rate 8 Table of Contents will become 25%. Our business and operating results will be affected due to the fact that we become subject to the 25% tax rate under the new law. In addition, our historical operating results may not be indicative of our operating results for future periods as a result of the expiration of the 15% tax rate of the Company. Our inability to gain shareholder approval for certain share reforms required of companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange may adversely affect our market image and our ability to effectuate future transactions such as public offerings on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Pursuant to regulations issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the CSRC), we were required to gain shareholder approval for and implement certain share reforms in 2006. Under the share reform plans proposed by holders of our non-circulating A Shares in 2006 and 2007, respectively, all non-circulating A Shares would be converted into circulating A Shares and may be sold publicly on the Shanghai Stock Exchange subject to any applicable lock-up period under the condition that holders of our non-circulating A Shares transfer a portion of their A Shares to holders of our circulating A Shares. However, holders of our circulating A Shares rejected both share reform plans. No specific new proposals have yet been presented to implement the required share reforms. We are uncertain as to when such share reforms will be completed. On January 8, 2007, the Shanghai Stock Exchange began to impose stricter regulations on its listed companies that are required but unable to complete the share reforms, including stricter trading information disclosure requirements and greater restrictions on their ability to effectuate future public offerings. Since March 26, 2007, the Shanghai Stock Exchange has required us to make periodically public announcements regarding the status of our share reforms. In addition, the CSRC is expected to more strictly scrutinize any securities-related applications by publicly listed PRC companies that are required to but have failed to complete such share reforms, their major shareholders and ultimate beneficial owners. Our inability to complete such share reforms may adversely affect our market image and our ability to effectuate future transactions such as public offerings on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The possibility that the CSRC and the Shanghai Stock Exchange will impose more restrictions cannot be eliminated. Interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations is uncertain. The Chinese legal system is based on statutory law. Under this system, prior court decisions may be cited as persuasive authority, but do not have the binding effect of precedents. Since 1979, the Chinese government has been developing a comprehensive system of commercial laws and considerable progress has been made in the promulgation of laws and regulations dealing with economic matters, such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. Because these laws, regulations and legal requirements are relatively new and not all accessible to the public and because prior court decisions have little precedential value, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, regulations and legal requirements involve greater uncertainty than in other jurisdictions. You may not enjoy shareholders protections that you would be entitled to in other jurisdictions. As most of our business is conducted in China, our operations are governed principally by the laws of China. Despite changes to the PRC Company Law, Chinese legal provisions for the protection of shareholders rights and access to information are different and less developed than those applicable to companies formed in the United States, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and other developed countries or regions. You may not enjoy shareholders protections under Chinese law that you would be entitled to in other jurisdictions. Our Articles of Association require you to submit your disputes with us and other persons to arbitration. You will have no legal right to a court proceeding. Our Articles of Association require holders of our H shares or ADSs having a claim against, or a dispute with, us, our directors, supervisors, executive officers or a holder of our domestic shares relating to any rights or obligations conferred or imposed by our Articles of Association, the Chinese Company Law or any other Chinese 9 Table of Contents laws or regulations relating to our affairs, to submit such claim or dispute to arbitration with the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission or to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center. Our Articles of Association further provide that any arbitration decisions with respect to such disputes or claims shall be final and binding on all parties. We may be or become a passive foreign investment company, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors. We may be classified as a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such characterization could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to you if you are a U.S. investor. For example, U.S. investors who owned our ADSs during any taxable year in which we were a PFIC generally are subject to increased U.S. tax liabilities and reporting requirements for that taxable year and all succeeding years, regardless of whether we actually continue to be a PFIC, although a shareholder election to terminate such deemed PFIC status may be available in certain circumstances. The same adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences will apply to U.S. investors who acquire our ADSs during the current taxable year of 2008 or any subsequent taxable year if we are treated as a PFIC for that taxable year. The determination of whether or not we are a PFIC is made on an annual basis and depends on the composition of our income and assets, including goodwill, from time to time. Specifically, we will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. tax purposes for a taxable year if either (a) 75% or more of our gross income for such taxable year is passive income, or (b) 50% or more of the average percentage of our assets during such taxable year either produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income. For such purposes, if we directly or indirectly own 25% or more of the shares of another corporation, we will be treated as if we (a) held directly a proportionate share of the other corporations assets, and (b) received directly a proportionate share of the other corporations income. We do not believe that we are currently a PFIC. However, because the PFIC determination is highly fact intensive and made at the end of each taxable year, there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for the current or any future taxable year or that the IRS will not challenge our determination concerning our PFIC status. For further discussion of the adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences of our possible classification as a PFIC, see Taxation below.
