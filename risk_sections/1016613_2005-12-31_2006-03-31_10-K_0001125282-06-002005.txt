RISK FACTORS REGISTRANT MUST OVERCOME PRICING COMPETITION WITH RESPECT TO ITS ACPG PRODUCTS. COMPETITIVE PRICING PRESSURES CAN CAUSE PROFIT EROSION. The ACPG products compete against products sold by an increasing number of competitors on the basis of several factors including price. In order to compete in the marketplace, ACPG's products must provide superior technology at competitive prices. Failure to produce cost-effective products could adversely affect customer demand and adversely affect Registrant's results of operations. In addition, the competitive business arena could create pricing pressure for the ACPG products. A reduction in pricing of ACPG's products due to competitive pressures could have an adverse effect on Registrant's revenues, operating income and results of operations. REGISTRANT MUST DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. IF REGISTRANT FAILS TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS ON A TIMELY BASIS, IT MAY LOSE MARKET SHARE. REGISTRANT'S INVESTMENT IN THE PINNACLE SOFTWARE SOLUTION MAY NOT REALIZE A RETURN ON INVESTMENT. The market for ACPG's Pinnacle software solution is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our future success will depend to a substantial extent on our ability to: o Invest significantly in research and product development; o Develop, introduce and support new products and enhancements on a timely basis; and o Gain and consecutively increase market acceptance of our products. Registrant's ACPG division is currently developing new products and enhancements to its existing products. Registrant may not be able to successfully complete the development and market introduction of new products or product enhancements. If Registrant fails to develop and deploy new products and product enhancements on a timely basis, or if Registrant fails to gain market acceptance of its new products, revenues will decline and Registrant may lose market share to its competitors. There is no assurance that Registrant will be successful in marketing and selling its Pinnacle software solution or other new products, that the revenues from the sales of the Pinnacle software solution or other new products will justify the investment, or that the sales of Pinnacle will continue to increase. THE AVAILABILITY AND PRICING OF COMPONENT PARTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT PRODUCTION AND PROFITABILITY. Registrant's ability to grow earnings will be affected by increases in the cost of component parts, including electronic components and circuit boards. Registrant may not be able to offset fully the effects of higher component parts through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs. FUTURE ACQUISITIONS MAY NOT BE FOUND OR MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED INTO REGISTRANT'S BUSINESS AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT REGISTRANT'S BUSINESS. Registrant has pursued, and will continue to pursue, growth opportunities through attempted acquisition of complementary businesses, products and technologies. Registrant is unable to predict whether or when any other prospective acquisition will be completed. The process of integrating an acquired business may be prolonged due to unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of Registrant's resources and management's attention. There can be no assurances that management will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions, integrate acquired businesses into existing operations, or expand into new markets. Further, once integrated, acquisitions may not achieve levels of revenues, profitability or productivity comparable to Registrant's existing business or otherwise perform as expected. The occurrence of any of these events could harm Registrant's business, financial condition or results of operations. 5 In addition, future acquisitions may require substantial capital resources, which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing. Future acquisitions by us could result in the following, any of which could seriously harm our results of operations or the price of our stock: o issuance of equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders' percentages of ownership; o large one-time write-offs; o the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities; o difficulties in the assimilation and integration of operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems of the acquired companies; o diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; o contractual disputes; o risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or only limited prior experience; and o potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations. THE ACPG BUSINESS HAS INCURRED NET LOSSES. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL TURN PROFITABLE IN THE FUTURE. Registrant (including the ACPG operations) has incurred losses in the past and may incur losses in the future. The ACPG business incurred net losses in 2005, 2004 and 2003. In 2005, the ACPG business's net loss was approximately $(1.0) million. In 2004, the ACPG business's net loss was approximately $(1.4) million. In 2003, the ACPG business's net loss was approximately $(0.9) million. Continued or increased net losses could have a material adverse effect on Registrant's business, financial condition and results of operations and the value and market price of Registrant's common stock. REGISTRANT'S SUCCESS IN THE SES BUSINESS DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO EXPAND THE SES ADVISORY PANEL. Registrant may not be able to identify additional senior executive service law enforcement agents who are able to serve as Advisors on the Advisory Panel. Such inability would harm the development of the SES business in general, and prevent Registrant from distinguishing itself in the marketplace in particular, which could adversely affect revenues and results of operations. SES IS A NEWLY FORMED BUSINESS. As a newly formed organization, SES has no independent record of performance in the various service categories it has identified. As a new business, SES may not be successful in being engaged by prospective clients, which would have an adverse affect on revenues and results of operations. SOME OF REGISTRANT'S COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER RESOURCES THAN REGISTRANT, WHICH MAY LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE WITH THEM. Some of Registrant's competitors have greater financial, personnel and other resources than Registrant, which may limit its ability to effectively compete with them. For example, Registrant's main competitors in the ACPG business include Tyco International Ltd. and Honeywell International Inc. These and other large competitors may be able to: o Respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements; o Benefit from greater economies of scale; o Offer more aggressive pricing; and/or o Devote greater resources to the promotion of their products. REGISTRANT IS DEPENDENT ON ITS KEY PERSONNEL, THE LOSS OF WHOM COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT BUSINESS. Registrant is dependent on its key personnel, including general management, software and hardware engineers, technical support and sales executives, who have significant industry experience, knowledge and know how. The loss of these key personnel could negatively affect business and results of operations. 6 REGISTRANT'S STOCK HAS BEEN DELISTED FROM THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET, AND IS THEREFORE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS LIQUID THAN BEFORE. Registrant's common stock has been delisted from trading on The NASDAQ National Market by reason of not maintaining listing requirements due to the lack of tangible business operations and significantly reduced market price of the common stock. As a result, Registrant's common stock currently trades over the counter on the NASDAQ OTC Bulletin Board, and the ability of Registrant's stockholders to obtain liquidity and consistent market prices for Registrant's shares has been significantly impaired. REGISTRANT INCURS THE EXPENSE OF COMPLYING WITH PUBLIC COMPANY REPORTING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS. As a public company, Registrant incurs significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ, have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. These rules and regulations increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, Registrant incurs additional costs associated with its public company reporting requirements. These rules and regulations also may make it more difficult and more expensive for Registrant to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and Registrant may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. REGISTRANT RELIES ON LICENSES WITH THIRD PARTIES TO LICENSE SOFTWARE CODE THAT IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ACPG BUSINESS'S PINNACLE SOFTWARE SOLUTION AND IF REGISTRANT WOULD NEED TO SEEK ALTERNATE LICENSES, ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. Registrant licenses certain software code that is an integral part of ACPG's Pinnacle software solution from third parties. In particular, Registrant obtains from third party licensors certain software code included in the Pinnacle software solution, and the software for its badging products. Registrant would need to seek alternative licensors for the software code if any of the third party licensors terminate or decides not to renew a license. If any of these third party licensors become unable to or refuses to license its code, it could interrupt and delay the development, design and delivery of the Pinnacle software solution and related products. Any such disruption could adversely affect Registrant's results of operations. CYCLICAL INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT REGISTRANT'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Registrant's operating results may be affected adversely by the general cyclical pattern of the industries in which it operates. For example, demand for ACPG products and services is significantly affected by levels of commercial construction and consumer and business discretionary spending. The demand patterns of these markets could impact the revenues and margins in this business. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS NONE
