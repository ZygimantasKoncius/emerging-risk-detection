Item 1a. Risk Factors: (continued) Operating Costs: Associate expenses attribute to the majority of its operating costs and therefore, the company's financial performance is greatly influenced by increasing wage and benefit costs, a competitive labor market and the risk of unionized labor disruptions of its non-union workforce. The company's profit is particularly sensitive to the cost of oil. Oil prices directly affect the company's product transportation costs, as well as its utility and petroleum-based supply costs. The company is extremely concerned about the continuing rise in interchange fees for accepting credit card payments at the point of sale. Self-Insurance Exposure: The company is self-insured for a majority of its workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle accident and associate medical benefit claims. The company is liable for associate health claims up to a lifetime aggregate of $1,000,000 per member and for workers' compensation claims up to $2,000,000 per claim. Property and casualty insurance coverage is maintained with outside carriers at deductible or retention levels ranging from $100,000 to $1,000,000. Although the company has minimized its exposure on individual claims, the company, for the benefit of cost savings, has accepted the risk of an unusual amount of independent multiple material claims arising and having a significant impact on earnings. Taxes: The company's future effective tax rate may increase from current rates due to changes in laws and the status of pending items with various taxing authorities. Item 1b. Unresolved Staff Comments: There are no unresolved staff comments.
