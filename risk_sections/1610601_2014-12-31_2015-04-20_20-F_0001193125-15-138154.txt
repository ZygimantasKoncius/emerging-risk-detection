D. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Doing Business in ChinaPRC regulation of loans to, and direct investment in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may restrict or prevent us from using offshore funds to make loans to our PRC subsidiary and consolidated affiliated entity and its subsidiaries, or to make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary. As a result, there is uncertainty with respect to our ability to provide prompt financial support to our PRC subsidiary and consolidated affiliated entity when needed. Notwithstanding the forgoing, our PRC subsidiary may use its own retained earnings (rather than RMB converted from foreign currency denominated capital) to provide financial support to our consolidated affiliated entity either through entrustment loans from our PRC subsidiary to our consolidated affiliated entity or direct loans to such consolidated affiliated entitys nominee shareholders, which would be contributed to the consolidated variable entity as capital injections. Such direct loans to the nominee shareholders would be eliminated in our consolidated financial statements against the consolidated affiliated entitys share capital. 85 Table of Contents Our full-time employees in the PRC participate in a government-mandated contribution plan pursuant to which certain pension benefits, medical care, unemployment insurance, employee housing fund and other welfare benefits are provided to such employees. We accrue for these benefits based on certain percentages of the employees salaries. The total provisions for such employee benefits were US$0.3 million in 2012, US$1.0 million in 2013 and US$2.6 million in 2014. We expect our contribution towards such employee benefits to increase in the future as we continue to expand our workforce and as salary levels of our employees continue to increase. The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014 (in US$ thousands) Net cash used in operating activities (4,104 ) (5,135 ) (5,933 ) Net cash used in investing activities (1,992 ) (3,181 ) (9,549 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 23,551 45,000 412,256 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (34 ) 151 (1,180 ) Net (decrease by) increase in cash and cash equivalents 17,421 36,835 395,594 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 1,118 18,539 55,374 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 18,539 55,374 450,968 Anticipated Use of Cash We intend to invest in our research and development capabilities to grow our user base and enhance user experience. We intend to continue to market our services, promote our brand, strengthen our customer service capabilities and enhance monetization. In order to support our overall business expansion, we also expect to make investments in our corporate facilities and information technology infrastructure. We may pursue strategic alliances and acquisitions that complement our social networking platform. We plan to fund these expenditures with cash and cash equivalents that we have. Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities amounted to US$5.9 million in 2014, which was primarily attributable to a net loss of US$25.4 million, adjusted for non-cash items of US$9.5 million and increase of US$10.0 million in working capital. The non-cash items primarily included US$6.6 million in share-based compensation expenses and US$2.8 million in depreciation on property and equipment. The increase in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in deferred revenue of US$12.8 million, an increase in accounts payable of US$4.5 million and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of US$5.9 million, which was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of US$7.5 million and an increase in accounts receivable of US$5.2 million. The increase in deferred revenue was mainly attributable to the increase of our members and membership subscription fees that our members paid in advance, as well as the increase in mobile games revenues paid in advance. The increase in accounts payable was mainly attributable to the increase in revenue-sharing payable to game developers. The increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities was mainly attributable to (i) an increase in payroll and welfare payable due to an increased headcount and increased salaries, (ii) an increase in marketing promotional fees payable, and (iii) an increase in fees payable for professional services. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets is mainly attributable to (i) an increase in VAT resulting primarily from the purchase of property and equipment as well as advertising activities; (ii) an increase in commission fees we paid to third-party application stores and other payment channels for distributing our mobile application and membership subscription services; and (iii) an increase in advance payment made to third-party game developers. 86 Table of Contents Net cash used in operating activities amounted to US$5.1 million in 2013, which was primarily attributable to a net loss of US$9.3 million, adjusted for non-cash items of US$1.8 million and increase of US$2.4 million in working capital. The non-cash items included US$1.0 million in share-based compensation expenses and US$0.8 million in depreciation. The increase in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in deferred revenue of US$3.7 million and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of US$1.3 million, which was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of US$1.9 million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of US$0.8 million. The increase in deferred revenue was mainly attributable to the increase of our members and membership subscription fees that our members paid in advance. The increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities was mainly attributable to (i) increase in payroll and welfare payable relating to our increased headcount and increased salaries; and (ii) increased deferred government subsidy. The increase in accounts receivable is mainly attributable for the revenues collected through third-party payment channels. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets is mainly attributable to the increase in commission fees we paid to third-party application stores and other payment channels for distributing our mobile application and membership subscription services. Net cash used in operating activities amounted to US$4.1 million in 2012, which was primarily attributable to a net loss of US$3.8 million, adjusted for non-cash items of US$0.7 million and decrease of US$1.0 million in working capital. The non-cash items include US$0.6 million in share-based compensation expenses and US$0.1 million in depreciation. The decrease in working capital was attributable to increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of US$0.7 million and increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of US$0.3 million. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities amounted to US$9.5 million in 2014, which was primarily attributable to our purchase of servers, computers and other equipment and payments for leasehold improvements for our new office in Beijing, which we have occupied since June 2014. Net cash used in investing activities amounted to US$3.2 million in 2013, which was primarily attributable to our purchase of servers, computer and other equipment. Net cash used in investing activities amounted to US$2.0 million in 2012, which was primarily attributable to our purchase of computer and other equipment, and advance to a related party for a cost-method investment in Smartisan Technology Co., Ltd. (which was completed in April 2013) on behalf of us. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a description of the cost-method investment. 87 Table of Contents Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to US$412.3 million in 2014, which was primarily attributable to proceeds from our issuance of preferred shares to investors and proceeds from our initial public offering. Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to US$45.0 million in 2013, which was attributable to proceeds from our issuance of preferred shares to investors. Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to US$23.6 million in 2012, which was attributable to proceeds from our issuance of preferred shares to investors. Holding Company Structure Our company is a holding company with no material operations of its own. We conduct our operations primarily through our wholly owned subsidiaries and our consolidated affiliated entity and its subsidiaries in China. As a result, our ability to pay dividends depends upon dividends paid by our wholly owned subsidiaries. If our wholly owned subsidiaries or any newly formed subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us. In addition, our wholly owned subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends to us only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Under PRC law, each of our wholly owned PRC subsidiaries and our consolidated affiliated entity is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. As a result of these PRC laws and regulations, the capital and statutory reserves restricted which represented the amount of net assets of our relevant subsidiaries in PRC not available for distribution were US$93.5 million as of December 31, 2014. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures amounted to US$1.0 million, US$3.2 million and US$8.7 million in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. In the past, our capital expenditures were principally incurred to purchase servers, computers and other office equipment, and to pay for leasehold improvements for our offices. As our business expands, we may purchase new servers, computers and other equipment in the future, as well as make leasehold improvements. C. Research and Development We focus our research and development efforts on the continual improvement and enhancement of our platforms features and services, as well as the design and development of games that are suitable for publishing on our own platform. We have a large team of engineers and developers, which accounted for over 45% of our employees as of December 31, 2014. Most of our engineers and developers are based in our headquarters in Beijing. 88 Table of Contents In the three years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, our research and development expenditures, including share-based compensation expenses for research and development staff, were US$1.5 million, US$3.5 million and US$9.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our research and development expenditures represented 20.7% of our total revenues. Our research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits, including share-based compensation expenses, for research and development personnel and rental expenses. Expenditures incurred during the research phase are expensed as incurred. We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we expand our research and development team to develop new features and services for our platform and further enhance our big data analytical capabilities. D. Trend Information Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events for the year ended December 31, 2014 that are reasonably likely to have a material and adverse effect on our net revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause the disclosed financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future results of operations or financial conditions. E. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholders equity or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity for such assets. We do not have any obligation, including a contingent obligation, arising out of a variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that we hold and material to us, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. F. Contractual Obligations We lease certain of our facilities and offices under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The rental expenses were US$0.4 million, US$0.9 million and US$3.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, future minimum commitments under non-cancelable agreements were as follows: Total 2015 2016 2017 2018 andthereafter (in US$ thousands) Operating lease 5,242 3,307 1,516 419  Other than the operating lease shown above, we did not have any significant capital and other commitments, long-term obligations, or guarantees as of December 31, 2014.

Share Incentive Plans 2012 Plan In November 2012, we adopted a share incentive plan, or the 2012 Plan, which was amended and restated in October 2013. The maximum aggregate number of shares which may be issued pursuant to all awards under the 2012 Plan is 44,758,220 Class A ordinary shares. With the adoption of our 2014 Plan, we no longer issue incentive shares under the 2012 Plan. As of March 31, 2015, options to purchase 30,787,026 Class A ordinary shares have been granted, 30,684,526 of which remained outstanding.

The board or such committee(s) may also delegate, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, to one or more officers of our company, its powers under the 2012 Plan to determine the officers and employees who will receive awards, the number of such awards, and the terms and conditions thereof.

BVI Plan In January 2015, Momo Technology Overseas Holding Company Limited, or Momo BVI, our wholly owned BVI subsidiary, adopted a share incentive plan, or the BVI Plan. The maximum number of ordinary shares issuable pursuant to awards granted under the BVI Plan is 30,000,000. The BVI Plan is administered by the board of directors of Momo BVI or one or more committees thereof, which shall determine the participants to receive awards, the type and number of awards to be granted to each participant, and the terms and conditions of each grant.

In January 2015, Momo BVI granted options to purchase 1,750,000 and 5,000,000 of its shares to employees and an executive of Momo Information Technologies Corp., its wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in Delaware, with an exercise price of US$0.10 and $0.11 per share, respectively, all of which remained outstanding as of March 31, 2015. 95 Table of Contents Employment Agreements and Indemnification Agreements We have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers. Under these agreements, each of our executive officers is employed for a specified time period. We may terminate employment for cause, at any time, without advance notice or remuneration, for certain acts of the executive officer, such as conviction or plea of guilty to a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude, negligent or dishonest acts to our detriment, or misconduct or a failure to perform agreed duties. We may also terminate an executive officers employment without cause upon three-month advance written notice. In such case of termination by us, we will provide severance payments to the executive officer as expressly required by applicable law of the jurisdiction where the executive officer is based. The executive officer may resign at any time with a three-month advance written notice. Each executive officer has agreed to hold, both during and after the termination or expiry of his or her employment agreement, in strict confidence and not to use, except as required in the performance of his or her duties in connection with the employment or pursuant to applicable law, any of our confidential information or trade secrets, any confidential information or trade secrets of our clients or prospective clients, or the confidential or proprietary information of any third party received by us and for which we have confidential obligations. The executive officers have also agreed to disclose in confidence to us all inventions, designs and trade secrets which they conceive, develop or reduce to practice during the executive officers employment with us and to assign all right, title and interest in them to us, and assist us in obtaining and enforcing patents, copyrights and other legal rights for these inventions, designs and trade secrets. In addition, each executive officer has agreed to be bound by non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions during the term of his or her employment and typically for one year following the last date of employment. Specifically, each executive officer has agreed not to (i) approach our suppliers, clients, customers or contacts or other persons or entities introduced to the executive officer in his or her capacity as a representative of us for the purpose of doing business with such persons or entities that will harm our business relationships with these persons or entities; (ii) assume employment with or provide services to any of our competitors, or engage, whether as principal, partner, licensor or otherwise, any of our competitors, without our express consent; or (iii) seek directly or indirectly, to solicit the services of any of our employees who is employed by us on or after the date of the executive officers termination, or in the year preceding such termination, without our express consent.

Under these agreements, we agree to indemnify our directors and executive officers against certain liabilities and expenses incurred by such persons in connection with claims made by reason of their being a director or officer of our company. 96 Table of Contents C. Board Practices Board of Directors Our board of directors consists of nine directors. A director is not required to hold any shares in our company to qualify to serve as a director. A director may vote with respect to any contract, proposed contract or arrangement in which he is materially interested provided (i) such director, if his interest in such contract or arrangement is material, has declared the nature of his interest at the earliest meeting of the board at which it is practicable for him to do so, either specifically or by way of a general notice and (ii) if such contract or arrangement is a transaction with a related party, such transaction has been approved by the audit committee. The directors may exercise all the powers of the company to borrow money, mortgage its undertaking, property and uncalled capital, and issue debentures or other securities whenever money is borrowed or as security for any obligation of the company or of any third party. None of our non-executive directors has a service contract with us that provides for benefits upon termination of service. Committees of the Board of Directors We have established an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee under the board of directors. We have adopted a charter for each of the three committees. Each committees members and functions are described below. Audit Committee Our audit committee consists of Benson Bing Chung Tam, Dr. Dave Daqing Qi and Yong Li. Mr. Tam is the chairman of our audit committee. We have determined that Mr. Tam and Dr. Qi satisfy the independence requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, an that each of them qualifies as an audit committee financial expert. The audit committee oversees our accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of the financial statements of our company. The audit committee is responsible for, among other things:  appointing the independent auditors and pre-approving all auditing and non-auditing services permitted to be performed by the independent auditors;  reviewing with the independent auditors any audit problems or difficulties and managements response;  discussing the annual audited financial statements with management and the independent auditors;  reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of our accounting and internal control policies and procedures and any steps taken to monitor and control major financial risk exposures;  reviewing and approving all proposed related party transactions;  meeting separately and periodically with management and the independent auditors; and  monitoring compliance with our code of business conduct and ethics, including reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of our procedures to ensure proper compliance. 97 Table of Contents Compensation Committee Our compensation committee consists of Yong Li, Benson Bing Chung Tam and Dr. Dave Daqing Qi. Mr. Li is the chairman of our compensation committee. We have determined that Mr. Tam and Dr. Qi satisfy the independence requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The compensation committee assists the board in reviewing and approving the compensation structure, including all forms of compensation, relating to our directors and executive officers. Our chief executive officer may not be present at any committee meeting during which his compensation is deliberated. The compensation committee is responsible for, among other things:  reviewing and approving, or recommending to the board for its approval, the compensation for our chief executive officer and other executive officers;  reviewing and recommending to the board for determination with respect to the compensation of our non-employee directors;  reviewing periodically and approving any incentive compensation or equity plans, programs or similar arrangements; and  selecting compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser only after taking into consideration all factors relevant to that persons independence from management. Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Our nominating and corporate governance committee consists of Yan Tang, Benson Bing Chung Tam and Dr. Dave Daqing Qi. Mr. Tang is the chairperson of our nominating and corporate governance committee. We have determined that Mr. Tam and Dr. Qi satisfy the independence requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The nominating and corporate governance committee assists the board of directors in selecting individuals qualified to become our directors and in determining the composition of the board and its committees. The nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for, among other things:  selecting and recommending to the board nominees for election by the shareholders or appointment by the board;  reviewing annually with the board the current composition of the board with regards to characteristics such as independence, knowledge, skills, experience and diversity;  making recommendations on the frequency and structure of board meetings and monitoring the functioning of the committees of the board; and  advising the board periodically with regards to significant developments in the law and practice of corporate governance as well as our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and making recommendations to the board on all matters of corporate governance and on any remedial action to be taken. Duties of Directors Under Cayman Islands law, our directors have a fiduciary duty to act honestly, in good faith and with a view to our best interests. Our directors also owe to our company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his knowledge and experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands. In fulfilling their duty of care to us, our directors must ensure compliance with our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time, and the class rights vested thereunder in the holders of the shares. Our company has the right to seek damages if a duty owed by our directors is breached. 98 Table of Contents Our board of directors has all the powers necessary for managing, and for directing and supervising, our business affairs. The functions and powers of our board of directors include, among others:  convening shareholders annual general meetings and reporting its work to shareholders at such meetings;  declaring dividends and distributions;  appointing officers and determining the term of office of the officers;  exercising the borrowing powers of our company and mortgaging the property of our company; and  approving the transfer of shares in our company, including the registration of such shares in our share register. Terms of Directors and Executive Officers Our officers are elected by and serve at the discretion of the board of directors. Our directors are not subject to a term of office and hold office until such time as they are removed from office by ordinary resolution of the shareholders or by the unanimous written resolution of all the shareholders. A director will be removed from office automatically if, among other things, the director (i) becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors; or (ii) is found by our company to be or becomes of unsound mind. D. Employees We had 76, 209 and 456 employees as of December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had 456 employees, including 408 employees in Beijing, 34 employees in Chengdu and 14 employees in the United States. The following table sets forth the numbers of our employees categorized by function as of December 31, 2014. As ofDecember 31,2014 Function: Operations 34 Service development 213 General administration and human resources 61 Sales, customer service and marketing 148 Total 456 99 Table of Contents In addition to our full-time employees, we used 162 contract workers dispatched to us by staffing agencies as of December 31, 2014. These contract workers are primarily responsible for content management and monitoring and for customer service. As required by laws and regulations in China, we participate in various employee social security plans that are organized by municipal and provincial governments, including housing, pension, medical insurance and unemployment insurance. We are required under Chinese law to make contributions to employee benefit plans at specified percentages of the salaries, bonuses and certain allowances of our employees, up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time. We typically enter into standard confidentiality and employment agreements with our management and service development personnel. These contracts include a standard non-compete covenant that prohibits the employee from competing with us, directly or indirectly, during his or her employment and for two years after the termination of his or her employment, provided that we pay compensation equal to a certain percentage of the employees salary during the restriction period in accordance with applicable laws. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees, and we have not experienced any labor disputes. None of our employees are represented by labor unions. E. Share Ownership For information regarding the share ownership of our directors and officers, see Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party TransactionsA. Major Shareholders. For information as to stock options granted to our directors, executive officers and other employees, see Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and EmployeesB. CompensationShare Incentive Plans. Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions A. Major Shareholders The following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our shares as of March 31, 2015 by:  each of our current directors and executive officers; and  each person known to us to own beneficially more than 5% of our shares. Percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 377,756,110 total outstanding ordinary shares as of the date of March 31, 2015, representing the sum of 280,869,740 Class A ordinary shares and 96,886,370 Class B ordinary shares of our company. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These rules generally provide that a person is the beneficial owner of securities if such person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of securities, or to dispose or direct the disposition of securities or has the right to acquire such powers within 60 days. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we have included shares that the person has the right to acquire within 60 days, including through the exercise of any option, warrant or other right or the conversion of any other security, in both the numerator and the denominator. These shares, however, are not included in the computation of the percentage ownership of any other person. 100 Table of Contents Shares Beneficially Owned Ordinary SharesBeneficiallyOwned Voting Power Class AOrdinary Shares Class BOrdinary Shares Directors and executive officers**: %(1) %(2) Yan Tang(3) * 96,886,370 26.1 77.7 Yong Li(4) 16,846,899  4.5 1.3 Sichuan Zhang(5) * 96,886,370 26.1 77.7 David Ying Zhang(6) 66,214,647  17.5 5.3 Hongping Zhang(7)     Neil Nanpeng Shen(8) 18,570,966  4.9 1.5 Feng Yu(9) 18,570,966  4.9 1.5 Benson Bing Chung Tam(10)     Dave Daqing Qi(11)     Xiaoliang Lei(12) 9,774,616  2.6 * Jingping Zhang(13) *  * * Zhiwei Li(14) 8,215,526  2.2 * Jonathan Xiaosong Zhang(15) *  * * Li Wang(16) *  * * All directors and executive officers as a group 142,718,285 96,886,370 62.6 88.9 Principal Shareholders: Gallant Future Holdings Limited(17)  96,886,370 25.6 77.5 Alibaba Investment Limited(18) 77,749,140  20.6 6.2 Matrix Partners China II Hong Kong Limited(19) 65,970,897  17.5 5.3 Notes: * Less than 1% of our total outstanding Class A and Class B ordinary shares. ** Except for Messrs.
