Item 1A. Risk Factors, related to Coeurs operations in Bolivia and Note T  Segment Reporting, for information relating to its business segments and its domestic and export sales. Mexico  Palmarejo The Palmarejo surface and underground silver and gold mine, and associated milling operation, owned and operated by Coeur Mexican SA de CV (Coeur Mexicana), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company since December 21, 2007, is located in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. Access to the property is provided by air, rail, and all-weather paved and gravel roads from the state capitol of Chihuahua. 19 In its first full year of operations in 2010, Palmarejo produced 5.9 million ounces of silver and 102,440 ounces of gold. Cash operating costs per ounce and total cash costs per ounce of silver for 2010 were both $4.10. Metal sales in 2010 from Palmarejo totaled $230.0 million, or 45% of the Companys total metal sales, compared with $90.6 million and 30% of the Companys total metal sales in 2009. Sales of gold totaled $119.4 million and sales from silver were $110.6 million. Production costs in 2010 totaled $127.7 million while depreciation and depletion expense was $91.5 million. Total capital expenditures in 2010 were $54.2 million. The Companys property position at Palmarejo consists of 32 mining concessions totaling 46.94 square miles (12,158 hectares). Of the total concessions, 29 concessions consisting of 46.75 square miles (12,109 hectares) are owned 100% by Coeur Mexicana S.A. de C.V. (Coeur Mexicana), formerly Planet Gold S.A. de C.V. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company), and the remaining three concessions, representing 0.19 square miles (48.77 hectares) are partially owned (50 to 60%) by Coeur Mexicana. All of the Companys ore reserves are located on concessions owned 100% by Coeur Mexicana. All concessions owned by Coeur Mexicana are valid until at least 2029. In addition to Palmarejo, the Company also controls 8,289.7 hectares of concessions at the Yécora exploration-stage property located in Sonora, on the border with Chihuahua, and 7,169.9 hectares of concessions at the La Guitarra exploration-stage property in Chihuahua, south of Palmarejo. All property and equipment are in good operating condition with no major maintenance expected. Power is supplied to the property by the local power utility as well as by generators. Water is supplied to the property by pipeline from the Chinipas River and also from recycled process water collected at site. Commercial production commenced in April 2009. Recovery of gold has been consistent with the initial metallurgical testwork and feasibility study estimates and averaged 91.0% during 2010, up from 88.2% in 2009. The recovery of silver averaged 70% during 2010, which was below feasibility study estimates, but up from 66.3% in 2009. Although the Company will continue pursuing adjustments to the plant to increase silver recovery rates, it now expects silver recoveries average 72% going forward. The Palmarejo mine is located on the western flank of the Sierra Madre Occidental, a mountain range that comprises the central spine of northern Mexico. The north-northwest-trending Sierra Madre Occidental is composed of a relatively flat-lying sequence of Tertiary volcanic rocks that forms a volcanic plateau, cut by numerous igneous intrusive rocks. This volcanic plateau is deeply incised in the Palmarejo mine area, locally forming steep-walled canyons. The Sierra Madre Occidental gives way to the west to an extensional terrain that represents the southward continuation of the Basin and Range Province of the western United States, and then to the coastal plain of western Mexico. The gold and silver deposits at the Palmarejo mine, typical of many of the other silver and gold deposits in the Sierra Madre, are classified as epithermal deposits and are hosted in multiple veins, breccias and fractures. These geologic structures trend generally northwest to southeast and dip either southwest or northeast. The dip on the structures ranges from about 45 degrees to 70 degrees. In the mineralized portions of the structures gold and silver are zoned from top to bottom with higher silver values occurring in the upper parts of the deposit to a gold-rich basal portion, sometimes accompanied by base metal mineralization. The Palmarejo property contains a number of mineralized zones or areas of interest. The most important of these to date is the Palmarejo zone in the far north of the concessions which covers the old Palmarejo gold-silver mine formed at the intersection of the northwest-southeast trending La Prieta and La Blanca gold-silver bearing structures. In addition to Palmarejo, other mineralized vein and alteration systems in the district area have been identified all roughly sub-parallel to the Palmarejo zone. The most significant of these additional targets are the Guadalupe (including Animas) and La Patria vein systems in the southern part of the property which are currently under investigation by the Companys exploration teams. The Company spent $7.8 million in the Palmarejo district in 2010 to discover new silver and gold mineralization and define new ore reserves. This program consisted of drilling 194,678 feet (59,338 meters) of core. The exploration budget for Palmarejo for 2011 is $7.5 million. 20 Year-end Proven and Probable Ore Reserves  Palmarejo Mine 2010 2009 2008 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Proven Short tons (000s) 4,649 7,277 6,840 Ounces of silver per ton 7.12 5.05 5.09 Contained ounces of silver (000s) 33,096 37,121 34,844 Ounces of gold per ton 0.09 0.06 0.06 Contained ounces of gold 436,600 442,000 406,000 Probable Short tons (000s) 9,019 10,623 5,355 Ounces of silver per ton 4.29 5.03 5.37 Contained ounces of silver (000s) 38,662 53,400 28,732 Ounces of gold per ton 0.05 0.06 0.07 Contained ounces of gold 433,600 660,000 350,000 Proven and Probable Short tons (000s) 13,668 17,900 12,195 Ounces of silver per ton 5.25 5.06 5.21 Contained ounces of silver (000s) 71,758 90,521 63,576 Ounces of gold per ton 0.06 0.06 0.06 Contained ounces of gold 870,200 1,102,000 756,000 Year-end Mineralized Material  Palmarejo Mine 2010 2009 2008 Short tons (000s) 4,503 4,493 15,373 Ounces of silver per ton 3.70 3.48 3.47 Ounces of gold per ton 0.04 0.05 0.04 Operating Data 2010 2009 2008 Production Ore tons milled 1,835,408 1,065,508  Ore grade silver (oz./ton) 4.60 4.31  Ore grade gold (oz./ton) 0.06 0.06  Recovery silver(%) 69.8 66.3  Recovery gold(%) 91.1 88.2  Silver produced (oz.) 5,887,576 3,047,843  Gold produced (oz.) 102,440 54,740  Cost per Ounce Cash operating costs $ 4.10 $ 9.80 $  Other cash costs(6)    Cash costs(7) 4.10 9.80  Non-cash costs 15.56 17.00  Total production costs $ 19.66 $ 26.80 $  (1) Current ore reserves are effective as of December 31, 2010. Metal prices used in calculating proven and probable reserves were $16.25 per ounce of silver and $1,025 per ounce of gold. 21 (2) The ore reserves are underground and open pit minable and include an allowance for mining dilution and recovery. For the underground-minable reserves, the dilution and mining recovery is incorporated into the detailed design of each stope for the Palmarejo mine; a 10% dilution at a grade of 0.71 g/t Au and 61 g/t Ag and 100% mining recovery was used for the Guadalupe deposit. For the open pit-minable reserves, the mining dilution and mining recovery was incorporated into a block diluted model for the Palmarejo mine. No open pit reserves are included for the Guadalupe deposit at this time. (3) Metallurgical recovery factors of 93% for gold and 63% to 80% for silver were used in estimations for ore reserves for Palmarejo. (4) The ore reserves were prepared by D. Thompson (Manager of Corporate Technical Services) of the Companys technical staff in conjunction with the independent consulting firms of Applied Geo Science LLC, Mine Development Associates, Behre Dolber, and AMEC Mine and Metals. (5) For the Palmarejo mine the proven and probable reserves are defined as mineralized material above an economic cut-off grade demonstrating grade continuity delineated by exploration and definition drill holes with a nominal grid spacing of 15m to 40m, depending on area. Proven reserves is material at a distance of less than or equal to 15m from the nearest composite sample with a minimum of two drill holes (6 composite samples) used in the grade estimate. Probable reserves are defined by distance to the nearest composite sample of between 15m and 40m and a minimum of two drill holes (6 composite samples) used in the grade estimate. For the Guadalupe deposit the proven and probable reserves are defined as mineralized material above an economic cut-off grade demonstrating grade continuity delineated by exploration drill holes with a nominal grid spacing of 20m to 40 m. Proven reserves is material at a distance of less than or equal to 20m from the nearest composite sample with a minimum of two drill holes (5 composite samples) used in the grade estimate. Probable reserves are defined by distance to the nearest composite sample of between 20m and 40m and a minimum of two drill holes (5 composite samples) used in the grade estimate. (6) Includes production taxes and royalties, if applicable. (7) Cash costs per ounce of silver or gold represent a non-U.S. GAAP measurement that management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of its mining operations. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Costs to GAAP Production Costs. Bolivia  San Bartolomé The San Bartolomé open pit silver mine, and associated milling operation, operated by Empresa Minera Manquiri SA (Manquiri), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is located on the flanks of the Cerro Rico Mountain bordering the town of Potosí, Bolivia. Access to the property and the Companys processing facilities is by paved and all-weather gravel roads leading south-southwest from Potosí. Silver production for 2010 was 6.7 million ounces compared to 7.5 million ounces in 2009. Cash operating costs per ounce for 2010 were $7.87 per ounce compared to $7.80 per ounce in 2009. Total cash costs per ounce (which includes production taxes and royalties) for 2010 were $8.67 per ounce compared to $10.48 per ounce in 2009. Metal sales in 2010 were $143.0 million, representing 28% of the Companys total metal sales. One hundred percent of these sales were derived from silver. Production costs in 2010 totaled $60 million and depreciation and depletion expense was $19.7 million. Total capital expenditures in 2010 were $6.2 million. Coeur acquired 100% of the equity in Manquiri from Asarco Incorporated (ASARCO) on September 9, 1999. Manquiris principal asset is the mining rights to the San Bartolomé mine. Silver was first discovered in the area around 1545. Mining of silver and lesser amounts of tin and base metals has been conducted nearly continuously since that time from multiple underground mines driven into Cerro Rico. The prior owner did not conduct any mining or processing of the surface ores at San Bartolomé. The Company completed a preliminary feasibility study in 2000, which concluded that an open pit mine was potentially capable of producing approximately six million ounces of silver annually. In 2003, SRK, an independent consulting firm, was retained to review the reserve/resource estimate to include additional sampling data to incorporate additional resources acquired with the Plahipo project at Cerro Rico. During 2003, Coeur retained Fluor Daniel Wright to prepare an updated feasibility study which was completed at the end of the third quarter of 2004. 22 The study provides for the use of a cyanide milling flow sheet with a wet pre-concentration screen circuit which will result in the production of a doré that may be treated by a number of refiners under a tolling agreement which results in the return of refined silver to the Company that is readily marketed by metal banks and brokers to the ultimate customer. During 2004, the Company obtained all operating permits and commercial construction activities commenced. The Companys total capital cost (excluding political risk insurance premiums and capitalized interest) to place the mine into production was $237.9 million. The property, plant and equipment were placed into service in June 2008 and are maintained in good working condition through a regular preventative maintenance program with periodic improvements as required. Power is supplied to the property by the local power utility. Water is supplied to the property by a public water source. In November 2007, Bolivias Congress approved a reform to the mining tax code. The Bolivian tax rate on most mining companies has increased from 25.0% to 37.5%. However, mining companies that produce a doré product, as the San Bartolomé mine does, will receive a 5% credit based upon their specific operation. Thus, the tax rate for San Bartolomé is 32.5%. The Company obtained political risk insurance policies from the Overseas Private Insurance Corporation (OPIC) and another private insurer. The combined policies are in the amount of $155.0 million and cover Coeur up to the lesser of $131.0 million or 85.0% of any loss arising from expropriation, political violence or currency inconvertibility. The policy costs were capitalized during the development and construction phases and are now included as a cost of inventory produced over the term of the policies which expire in 2019 and 2024. The silver mineralization at San Bartolomé is hosted in unconsolidated sediments (pallacos) and reworked gravel (sucus and troceras) deposits and oxide stockpiles and dumps (desmontes) from past mining that occurred on the flanks of Cerro Rico. Cerro Rico is a prominent mountain in the region that reaches an elevation of over 15,400 feet (over 4,700 meters). It is composed of Tertiary-aged volcanic and intrusive rocks that were emplaced into and over older sedimentary, and volcanic, basement rocks. Silver, along with tin and base metals, is located in multiple veins and vein swarms that occur in a northeast trending belt which transects Cerro Rico. The upper parts of the Cerro Rico mineralized system were subsequently eroded and re-deposited into the flanking gravel deposits. Silver is hosted in all portions of the pallacos, sucus, and troceras with the best grades segregated to the coarser-grained silicified fragments. These deposits lend themselves to simple, free digging surface mining techniques and can be extracted without drilling and blasting. Of the several pallaco deposits which are controlled by Coeur and surround Cerro Rico, three are of primary importance and are known as Huacajchi, Diablo and Santa Rita. The mineral rights for the San Bartolomé mine are held through joint venture and long-term lease agreements with several independent mining cooperatives and the Bolivian state-owned mining organization COMIBOL. Manquiri controls 47.93 square kilometers (11,578 acres) of land at San Bartolomé around Cerro Rico under contracts and concessions and approximately 37.45 square kilometers (8.95 acres) of concessions at the Rio Blanco property, a gold exploration target south of Potosí. The San Bartolomé lease agreements, executed between 1996 and 2003 and with 25 year terms, are generally subject to a 4% production royalty payable partially to the cooperatives and partially to COMIBOL. During 2003, the Company acquired additional mining rights known as the Plahipo project which include the mining rights to oxide dumps adjacent to the original property package. The oxide dumps included in the Plahipo project are subject to a sliding scale royalty payable to COMIBOL that is a function of silver price. The Company incurred royalty payment obligations to COMIBOL and the Cooperatives for these mining rights totaling $5.4 million and $20.0 million for the years ended 2010 and 2009, respectively. On October 14, 2009, COMIBOL announced by resolution that it was temporarily suspending mining activities above the elevation of 4,400 meters above sea level while stability studies of Cerro Rico mountain are undertaken. The Company holds rights to mine above this elevation under valid contracts backed by Supreme Decree with COMIBOL as well as contracts with local mining cooperatives who hold their rights through COMIBOL. The Company temporarily adjusted its mine plan to confine mining activities to the ore deposits below 4,400 meters above sea level and timely notified COMIBOL of the need to lift the restriction. The mine plan has been temporarily adjusted and mining continues on the remainder of the property. In March 2010, San Bartolomé began mining operations in high grade material located in the Huacajchi deposit above the 4,400 meter level under an agreement with the Cooperative Reserva Fiscal, although restrictions on mining above the 4,400 meter level 23 continue. The Huacajchi deposit was confirmed to be excluded from the October 2009. Access to the Huacajchi deposit and its higher grade material is having beneficial effect on production and cost at the mine. Other mining areas above the 4,400 meter level continue to be suspended. The Company does not use explosives in its surface-only mining activities and is sensitive to the preservation of the mountain under its contracts with the state-owned mining entity and the local cooperatives. In 2010, no exploration work was performed at San Bartolomé. New pits (pozos) were dug to obtain samples for grade control purposes and to further define and expand the ore reserves.

The metal price used for current ore reserves was $16.25 per ounce of silver. 24 (2) Ore reserves are open pit-minable and include a mining recovery such that 15 cm buffer of ore material above the bedrock was excluded from the reserve; this equates to a mining recovery of 99.0%. (3) Ore reserves were prepared by D. Thompson (Manager of Corporate Technical Services) of the Companys technical staff. (4) Proven and probable ore reserves are defined by surface drill holes and pits (pozos) with an average spacing of no more than 70 meters. Proven reserves are those reserves in stockpile at the end of 2010. The grade of ore reserve block is determined by the grade of proximal drill hole and/or pit composites and three-dimensional models of geologic controls. A minimum of 8 and maximum of 20 composite were used to classify proven and probable ore reserves and variable geostatistical estimation variances. Mineralized material is similarly classified.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Costs to GAAP Production Costs. USA  Alaska-Kensington Mine The Kensington underground gold mine and associated milling facilities are located on the east side of the Lynn Canal about 45 miles north-northwest of Juneau, Alaska. The Kensington mine commenced commercial production on July 3, 2010. The mine is accessed by a horizontal tunnel and utilizes conventional and mechanized underground mining methods. Ore is processed in a flotation mill that produces a concentrate which is sold to third party smelters. Waste material is deposited in an impoundment facility on the property. Power is supplied to the site by on-site diesel generators. Access to the project is by a combination of road vehicles, boat, helicopter, float plane, or boat direct from Juneau. Production during the mines initial, partial year was 43,143 ounces of gold. In 2010, the Company conducted exploration to increase the size and geologic continuity of gold mineralization, which is expected to ultimately lead to an increase in ore reserves. In 2010, a total of $1.0 million was spent on this program and was focused on the new Raven zone, west of the currently mined area. Metal sales in 2010 at Kensington were $23.6 million. Production costs were $14.0 million and depreciation and depletion expense was $17.5 million. The Companys capital expenditures at the Kensington mine totaled approximately $92.7 million in 2010. Coeur Alaska, Inc., (Coeur Alaska), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, controls two contiguous land groups: the Kensington and Jualin properties. The Kensington property consists of 51 private patented lode and mill-site claims covering approximately 766 acres, 294 federal unpatented lode claims covering approximately 3,127 acres, and eight State of Alaska mining claims covering approximately 95 acres. The Company controls the Jualin Property, under a lease agreement with Hyak Mining Company, through the cessation of mining, so long as the Company makes timely payments pursuant to the lease agreement. The Jualin Property consists of 23 patented lode and mill-site claims covering approximately 383.6 acres, 438 federal unpatented lode claims and one unpatented mill-site claim covering approximately 7,911 acres, and 17 State of Alaska mining claims covering approximately 110 acres. The federal and state claims, as well as the private patented lode and mill-site claims, provide Coeur with the necessary rights to mine and process ore from Kensington. All of the Companys Alaska ore reserves are located within the patented claims. The unpatented claims and mill site are maintained via annual filings and fees to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which acts as administrator of the claims. State claims are maintained via filings and fees to Alaska Department of Nautral Resources  Juneau Recorders Office. Real property taxes to the State of Alaska are paid yearly for the patented claims. Lease payments are paid annually and all leases are in good standing. Coeur Alaska is obligated to pay a scaled net smelter return royalty on 1.0 million ounces of future gold production after Coeur Alaska recoups the $32.5 million purchase price and its construction and development expenditures incurred after July 7, 1995 in connection with placing the property into commercial production. The royalty ranges from 1% at $400 per ounce gold prices to a maximum of 2.5% at gold prices above $475 per ounce, with the royalty to be capped at 1.0 million ounces of production. 25 On June 22, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision that had invalidated the previously issued Section 404 Permit for the tailings facility for the Kensington gold mine. Following the U.S. Supreme Court decision, on August 14, 2009, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers re-activated the Companys 404 permit, clearing the way for construction at the tailing facility to continue. Production started on July 3, 2010. The Kensington ore deposit consists of multiple precious metals bearing mesothermal, quartz, carbonate and pyrite vein swarms and discrete quartz-pyrite veins hosted in the Cretaceous age Jualin diorite. Gold occurs as native grains in quartz veins and is associated with pyrite and various gold-telluride-minerals associated with the pyrite mineralization.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Costs to GAAP Production Costs. USA  Nevada-Rochester Mine The Rochester mine and associated heap leach facilities, is an open pit silver and gold mine, located in Pershing County, Nevada, which is located approximately 25 miles of paved and all-weather gravel road northeast of the town of Lovelock. The Company owns 100% of the Rochester Mine through the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, Coeur Rochester, Inc. (Coeur Rochester). The mine consists of the main Rochester deposit and the adjacent Nevada Packard deposit, due south of Rochester. Production at the Rochester mine in 2010 was approximately 2.0 million ounces of silver and 9,641 ounces of gold, compared to approximately 2.2 million ounces of silver and 12,663 ounces of gold in 2009. Production was lower due to decreased ounces recovered from the ore on leach pad. Cash operating costs per ounce of silver increased to $2.93 per ounce in 2010, compared to $1.95 per ounce in 2009. Total cash costs per ounce of silver (which includes production taxes and royalties) were $3.78 per ounce in 2010 compared to $2.58 per ounce in 2009. This increase was primarily due the decrease in ore produced from the current leach pad, combined with a lack of incremental ore production in 2010. Rochesters total metal sales in 2010 totaled $54.3 million, or approximately 11% of the Companys total metal sales. Approximately 78% of Rochesters metal sales were derived from silver, while 22% were derived from gold. Production costs totaled $24.8 million in 2010 and depreciation and depletion expenses were $1.9 million, compared to $24.2 million and $1.9 million in 2009. The Companys capital expenditures at the Rochester mine totaled approximately $2.3 million in 2010 and $0.3 million in 2009. The Company plans capital expenditures at the Rochester mine of $26.8 million in 2011, primarily for construction of a new leach pad and related infrastructure. Construction is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2011. This extension will increase total average annual silver and gold production to over 2.4 million ounces and 35,000 ounces, respectively, over several years. Coeur Rochester controls 541 U.S. Federal unpatented claims (including 54 mill sites), 23 patented claims, and leases an additional 53 unpatented claims, totaling approximately 7,200 acres. All of the Companys mineral reserves are located within the claims. The unpatented claims and mill sites are maintained via annual fees to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and to Pershing County, which acts as administrator of the claims. Real property taxes to the State of Nevada are paid yearly for the patented claims. Lease payments are paid annually; all leases are in good standing. The Company acquired the Rochester property from ASARCO in 1983 and commenced mining in 1986. No mining or processing was conducted at Rochester by the prior owner. The Company acquired its initial interest in 27 the adjacent Nevada Packard property in 1996, completed the full purchase in 1999 and commenced mining in 2003. Very limited mining and processing was conducted at Nevada Packard by the prior owner. Collectively, the Rochester and Nevada Packard properties comprise the Companys Rochester silver and gold mining and processing operation. The Rochester mine is fully supported with electricity, supplied by a local power company on their public grid, telephone and radio communications, production water wells, and processing, maintenance, warehouse, and office facilities. All of these facilities are in good operating condition with no major maintenance expected. The mine utilizes the heap leaching process to extract both silver and gold from ore mined using conventional open pit methods. Gold and silver are recovered by heap leaching of crushed open-pit ore placed on pads located east of the Rochester mining area. Based upon actual operating experience and metallurgical testing, the Company estimates ultimate recovery rates from the crushed ore of between 59.0% and 63.0% for silver, depending on the ore being leached, and 93.0% for gold. See Note C  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements included herein, for further discussion. In August 2007, the Company determined that the ore reserves at Rochester were fully depleted and therefore ceased mining and crushing operations at the Rochester mine. The Company expects to continue residual heap leach activities through 2014 on this ore. In 2008, the Company commenced studies to investigate the potential to recommence mining and leaching of new material and in 2009 and 2010 completed feasibility studies demonstrating the viability of an expansion of mining and leaching operations at its Rochester mine through 2017. The Company prepared an Amended Plan of Operations for resumption of mining within the existing and permitted Rochester pit and construction of an additional heap leach pad, all within the currently permitted mine boundary. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) deemed this plan complete in August 2009 under federal regulations and initiated the National Environmental Policy Act process. The BLM issued a positive Decision Record (DR) for the mine to extend silver and gold mining operations by several years with new production ounces expected to begin being recovered in the fourth quarter of 2011. At Rochester, silver and gold mineralization is hosted in folded and faulted volcanic rocks of the Rochester Formation and overlying Weaver Formation. Silver and gold, consisting of silver sulfosalt minerals, argentite, silver-bearing tetrahedrite and minor native gold, are contained in zones of multiple quartz veins and veinlets (vein and vein swarms and stockworks) with variable amounts of pyrite. The Company is obligated to pay a net smelter royalty interest only when the average quarterly market price of silver equals or exceeds $23.02 per ounce indexed for inflation ($22.87 per ounce in 2010 and $22.61 per ounce in 2009) up to a maximum rate of 5% to ASARCO, the prior owner. Royalty expense was $0.2 million, nil and nil for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2010, exploration expenditures of $0.2 million funded 13,980 feet (4,261 meters) of angled reverse circulation drilling at the Nevada Packard deposit area. 28 Year-end Proven and Probable Ore Reserves  Rochester Mine 2010 2009 2008 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) Proven Short tons (000s) 35,959 31,821  Ounces of silver per ton 0.54 0.58  Contained ounces of silver (000s) 19,499 18,361  Ounces of gold per ton 0.005 0.006  Contained ounces of gold 196,100 185,000  Probable Short tons (000s) 12,312 10,596  Ounces of silver per ton 0.65 0.71  Contained ounces of silver (000s) 8,057 7,523  Ounces of gold per ton 0.004 0.005  Contained ounces of gold 51,300 48,000  Proven and Probable Short tons (000s) 48,271 42,417  Ounces of silver per ton 0.57 0.61  Contained ounces of silver (000s) 27,556 25,884  Ounces of gold per ton 0.005 0.005  Contained ounces of gold 247,400 233,000  Year-end Mineralized Material  Rochester Mine 2010 2009 2008 Short tons (000s) 215,603 104,783 114,058 Ounces of silver per ton 0.44 0.52 0.54 Ounces of gold per ton 0.003 0.004 0.005 29 Operating Data 2010 2009 2008 Production Tons ore mined (000s)    Tons crushed/leached (000s)    Ore grade silver (oz./ton)    Ore grade gold (oz./ton)    Recovery/Ag oz(%)    Recovery/Au oz(%)    Silver produced (oz.) 2,023,423 2,181,788 3,033,721 Gold produced (oz.) 9,641 12,663 21,041 Cost per Ounce Operating cash costs $ 2.93 $ 1.95 $ (0.75 ) Other cash costs(7) 0.85 0.63 0.72 Cash costs(8) 3.78 2.58 (0.03 ) Non-cash costs 1.04 0.93 0.78 Total production costs $ 4.82 $ 3.51 $ 0.75 (1) Current ore reserves are effective as of December 31, 2010. Metal prices used in calculating proven and probable reserves were $16.25 per ounce of silver and $1,025 per ounce of gold. (2) Reserves were estimated with a cutoff grade of 0.48 silver equivalent ounces per ton. (3) The mineralized material for Rochester and Nevada Packard deposits was estimated with silver and gold prices of $20.00 and $1,300 per ounce, respectively, historical metallurgical recoveries for gold and silver, historical mine operating costs within a Whittle® open pit model, and include no additional factors for dilution or recovery. The estimate of mineralized material and reserves was constrained to exclude any silver and gold mineralization beneath existing leaching operations. (4) Metallurgical recovery for oxide ore were 61% for silver and 92% for gold. Approximately 1.05 million tons (2.1%) of sulfide bearing ore is included in the total ore reserves at lower metallurgical recovery rates. However, ultimate recoveries will not be known until leaching operations cease. Current recovery may vary significantly from ultimate recovery, calculated based on the ounces recovered as a percent of the ounces placed on the pad. The ore reserves were estimated by D. Thompson (Manager of Corporate Technical Services) and C. Kiel (Superintendent of Rochester Technical Services) of the Companys technical staff. The firm of Pincock, Allen & Holt, an independent consulting group, was used to review engineering studies and the consulting firm of Reserva International was used to model results from drilling and update estimates of mineralized material. (5) Ore reserves are defined by drilling on a grid of 100 feet by 200 feet, or closer, and include open pit mine production sampling to assist with determination of gold and silver grades. The grade is defined by the number of proximal composites and three-dimensional geologic controls. The number of drill samples used in estimation of grades must be at least 4 with a maximum search distance 150 feet at Rochester and 120 feet at Nevada Packard.

Access to the property is provided by all-weather gravel roads leading 30 miles northeast of the town of Gobernador Gregores. Production at the Martha mine in 2010 was approximately 1.6 million ounces of silver and 1,838 ounces of gold compared to 3.7 million ounces of silver and 4,709 ounces of gold in 2009. The 57.5% decrease in silver production was primarily due to a 48.3% decrease in tons milled as a result of the reduction in mining operations in 2010. Cash operating costs per ounce for 2010 were $13.16 per ounce compared to $6.19 per ounce in 2009. Total cash costs per ounce of silver (which includes production taxes and royalties) were $14.14 in 2010 compared to $6.68 in 2009. The increase in total cash costs per ounce was attributed to the decrease in silver production as compared to 2009 due to a significant decrease in tons milled in 2010. Metal sales in 2010 totaled $53.9 million at Martha. Approximately 94% of these metal sales were derived from silver, with the balance coming from gold. Production costs totaled $27.0 million and depreciation and depletion expenses were $8.5 million, compared with $18.0 million and $7.4 million in 2009. Total capital expenditures at the Martha mine in 2010 were $0.1 million. The mineral rights for the Martha property are fully-owned by Coeur Argentina S.R.L. Mineral rights owned by Coeur Argentina S.R.L. in the Santa Cruz Province (excluding options on Joaquin and Satélite) total 184 square miles (47,660 hectares) of exploration concessions (claims), 256.3 square miles (66,380 hectares) of discovery concessions, and 3.4 square miles (874 hectares) of exploitation concessions. Martha is centered on the exploitation concessions, which fully cover the area of the mine infrastructure and the ore reserves reported herein. Concessions do not have an expiration date; subject only to required annual fees. Surface rights covering the Martha deposit are controlled by the 137.8 square mile (35,705-hectare) Cerro Primero de Abril Estancia which is owned by Coeur Argentina S.R.L. Included on the estancia is a 60-person camp, mine and exploration offices, and assay laboratory. The Company acquired the property in 2002 through the purchase of a subsidiary of Yamana Resources Inc. for $2.5 million. The prior owner conducted minor underground mining on the near-surface portion of the Martha vein from late 2000 to mid 2001. The Company is obligated to pay a 2.0% net smelter royalty on silver and gold production to Royal Gold Corporation granted by Yamana Resources. In addition, the Company is subject to a 3.0% net proceeds royalty payable to the Province of Santa Cruz. The Company incurred royalty expense totaling $1.5 million, $1.8 million and $1.9 million for the years ended 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Prior to 2008, ore from the Martha mine was trucked approximately 600 miles by road for processing at the Companys previously owned Cerro Bayo mill located approximately 270 miles away. In 2007, the Company commenced the construction of a 240 tonne per day flotation mill. The mill was completed and commenced operating in December 2007 and produces a flotation concentrate. In 2008, concentrate began to be shipped to a third-party smelter located in Mexico. The property and equipment are maintained in good working condition through a regular preventive maintenance program with periodic improvements as required. Power is provided by Company-owned diesel generators. At Martha, silver and gold mineralization is hosted in epithermal quartz veins and veinlets within generally sub-horizontal volcanic rocks of the Jurassic-aged Chon Aike Formation. The veins and veinlets occur as sub-parallel clusters largely trending west-northwest and dipping steeply to the southwest. The main ore minerals of silver and gold are silver sulfosalt minerals, argentite, electrum (a naturally-occurring gold and silver alloy) and native silver. During 2010, the Company spent $0.5 million to test extensions of the R4, Catalina, Betty Oeste and Betty Sur ore-bearing structures with drilling of 2,217 meters (7,274 feet) of new core drilling. The 2011 budget for exploration at Martha is $0.3 million. 31 Year-end Proven and Probable Ore Reserves  Martha Mine 2010 2009 2008 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Proven Short tons (000s)   18 Ounces of silver per ton   55.86 Contained ounces of silver (000s)   992 Ounces of gold per ton   0.07 Contained ounces of gold   1,000 Probable Short tons (000s) 45 38 58 Ounces of silver per ton 18.61 33.14 31.22 Contained ounces of silver (000s) 828 1,249 1,817 Ounces of gold per ton 0.02 0.04 0.04 Contained ounces of gold 1,089 1,400 2,000 Proven and Probable Short tons (000s) 45 38 76 Ounces of silver per ton 18.61 33.14 36.99 Contained ounces of silver (000s) 828 1,249 2,809 Ounces of gold per ton 0.02 0.04 0.04 Contained ounces of gold 1,089 1,400 3,000 Year-end Mineralized Material  Martha Mine 2010 2009 2008 Short tons (000s) 39 29 46 Ounces of silver per ton 14.02 59.54 29.50 Ounces of gold per ton 0.01 0.05 0.02 Operating Data 2010 2009 2008 Production Tons ore milled 56,401 109,974 57,886 Ore grade silver (oz./ton) 31.63 36.03 49.98 Ore grade gold (oz./ton) 0.04 0.05 0.07 Recovery silver(%) 88.3 93.6 93.7 Recovery gold(%) 84.1 87.6 88.3 Silver produced (oz.) 1,575,827 3,707,544 2,710,673 Gold produced (oz.) 1,838 4,709 3,313 Cost per Ounce Cash operating costs $ 13.16 $ 6.19 $ 6.87 Other cash costs(6) 0.98 0.49 0.70 Cash costs(7) 14.14 6.68 7.57 Non-cash costs 5.88 1.94 1.81 Total production costs $ 20.02 $ 8.62 $ 9.38 32 (1) Current ore reserves are effective as of December 31, 2010.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Costs to GAAP Production Costs. Australia  New South Wales  Endeavor Mine The Endeavor mine, is an underground silver and base metal operation, and associated mill facility, located in north-central New South Wales, Australia, about 447 miles (720 kilometers) from Sydney. Access to the mine is by paved roads 30 miles (18 kilometers) to the northwest from the community of Cobar. Production at the Endeavor mine in 2010 was 566,134 ounces of silver compared to 461,800 ounces of silver in 2009. The increase in silver production was due to an 18.2% increase in tons milled combined with a 17.4% increase in ore grades as compared to 2009. Cash operating costs and total cash costs per ounce of silver produced were $10.15 in 2010 compared to $6.80 in 2009. This increase was due primarily to the price participation component of the transaction and increased refining costs due to silver deduction retained by the refiner. Metal sales at the Endeavor mine in 2010 were $10.6 million, all of which was derived from silver. Production costs totaled $4.1 million and depreciation and depletion costs were $2.0 million. The Company incurred no capital expenditures at the Endeavor mine in 2010. The ore reserves at Endeavor are covered by five consolidated mining leases issued by the state of New South Wales to Cobar Operations Pty. Limited (Cobar), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBH Resources Ltd. (CBH). The leases form a contiguous block of 10,121 acres in size and expire between 2019 and 2027. Following the completion of the acquisition of all of CBHs issued ordinary shares on the 23rd of September, 2010, CBH Resources Limited is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toho Zinc Co. Ltd, a company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Endeavor mine has been in production since 1983. On September 12, 2003, CBH acquired the Elura mine and processing facilities from Pasminco and changed the name to the Endeavor mine. On May 23, 2005, CDE Australia Pty. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coeur (CDE Australia), acquired all of the silver production and reserves, up to a maximum 17.7 million payable ounces, contained at the Endeavor Mine, which is owned and operated by CBH, for $44.0 million including transaction fees. Under the terms of the original agreement, CDE Australia paid Cobar $15.4 million of cash at the closing. In addition, CDE Australia agreed to pay Cobar approximately $26.5 million upon the receipt of a report confirming that the reserves at the Endeavor mine are equal to or greater than the reported ore reserves for 2004. In addition, CDE Australia originally committed to pay Cobar an operating cost contribution of $1.00 for each ounce of payable silver plus a further increment when the silver price exceeds $5.23 per ounce. This further increment was to have begun on the second anniversary of this agreement and is 50% of the amount by which the silver price exceeds $5.23 per ounce. A cost contribution of $0.25 per ounce is also payable by CDE Australia in respect of new ounces of proven and probable silver reserves as they 33 are discovered. During the first quarter of 2007, $2.1 million was paid for additional ounces of proven and probable silver reserves under the terms of the contract. This amount was capitalized as a cost of the mineral interests acquired and is being amortized using the units of production method. The Company is not required to contribute to ongoing capital costs at the mine. On March 28, 2006, CDE Australia reached an agreement with CBH to modify the terms of the original silver purchase agreement. Under the modified terms, CDE Australia owns all silver production and reserves up to a total of 20.0 million payable ounces, up from 17.7 million payable ounces in the original agreement. The silver price-sharing provision was deferred until such time as CDE Australia had received approximately two million cumulative ounces of silver from the mine or June 2007, whichever was later. In addition, the silver price-sharing threshold increased to $7.00 per ounce, from the previous level of $5.23 per ounce. The conditions relating to the second payment were also modified and tied to certain paste fill plant performance criteria and mill throughput tests. In January 2008, the mine met the criteria for payment of the additional $26.2 million. This amount was paid on April 1, 2008, plus accrued interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from January 24, 2008. Expansion of the ore reserve will be required to achieve the maximum payable ounces of silver production as set forth in the modified contract. It is expected that future expansion to the ore reserve will occur as a result of the conversion of portions of the propertys existing inventory of mineralized material and future exploration discoveries near the mine. The mine employs bulk mining methods and utilizes a conventional flotation mill to produce a concentrate that is sold to a third-party smelter. Silver recovery averaged approximately 44.3% in 2010 and 49.9% in 2009. Power to the mine and processing facilities is provided by the grid servicing the local communities. The property and equipment are maintained in good working condition, by CBH, through a regular preventive maintenance program with periodic improvements as required. At Endeavor, silver, lead, zinc and lesser amounts of copper mineralization are contained within sulfide lenses hosted in fine-grained sedimentary rocks of the Paleozoic-aged Amphitheatre Group. Sulfide lenses are elliptically-shaped, steeply-dipping to the southwest and strike to the northwest. Principal ore minerals are galena, sphalerite and chalcopyrite. Silver occurs with both lead- and zinc-rich sulfide zones. CBH conducts regular exploration to define new reserves at the mine from both underground and surface core drilling platforms. For fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, which is the fiscal year used by the operator (CBH), the exploration expenditure at the mine was $0.6 million. Budgeted exploration for 2011 is approximately $1.3 million.

As a result of this transaction, the Company realized a gain on the sale in the third quarter of 2009 of approximately $25.5 million, net of income taxes. Coeur originally purchased this interest from Perilya Broken Hill Ltd. in September 2005 for $36.9 million. This transaction closed on July 30, 2009. Silver production in 2009 from the Broken Hill mine amounted to approximately 0.8 million ounces of silver compared to 1.4 million ounces of silver in 2008. The decrease in silver production was due to the sale of the Companys interest in the silver production from the Broken Hill mineral interests on July 1, 2009. The cash cost per ounce of silver production, which includes the operating cost contribution and smelting, refining and transportation 35 costs, was $3.40 in 2009 compared to $3.41 in 2008.

Metal prices used to calculate proven and probable reserves were $14.50 per ounce of silver and $850 per ounce of gold. (2) Ore reserves are minable reserves within underground mine designs and include factors for mining dilution and recovery. Veins are diluted to a minimum mining width of 2.4 meters at zero grade. Mining recovery is 90%. (3) Metallurgical recoveries of 93.4% and 90.5% should be applied to the contained silver and gold ounces, respectively. (4) Ore reserve estimates were prepared by J. Sims (Geologist), and D. Duffy (Mining Engineer) of the Companys technical staff. (5) Proven and probable reserves are defined by geostatistical methods within manual boundaries based on grade thickness contouring. For proven reserves: An area demonstrating grade continuity defined by two or more bounding horizontal levels of drill holes or channel samples spaced vertically no more than about 12.5 meters containing horizontally spaced samples less than 5 meters apart  the key feature being confirmation on two levels. For probable reserves: An area demonstrating grade continuity with channel sample or drill hole spacing less than about 35 meters. Mineralized material is similarly classified . (6) Includes production taxes. (7) Cash costs per ounce of silver or gold represent a non-U.S. GAAP measurement that management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of its mining operations. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Costs to GAAP Production Costs. (8) Cerro Bayo was sold in August 2010 and there was no production during the year prior to the sale. SILVER AND GOLD DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES The Company had no development properties at December 31, 2010. EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY Coeur, either directly or through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns, leases or has interests in certain exploration-stage mining properties located in the United States, Chile, Argentina, Tanzania, Bolivia, and Mexico. Exploration and reserve development expenditures of $18.0 million, $15.8 million and $19.3 million were incurred by the Company in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The main components of the 2010 program included:  Drilling to extend the strike length of, and define the Guadalupe Norte and Las Animas zones at Guadalupe in the Palmarejo district and initial testing of several new targets in the Palmarejo district.  Drilling to define and expand known mineralized zones in and around the current Palmarejo surface and underground mine.  Definition drilling on two targets on the Joaquin advanced exploration property, termed La Negra and La Morocha, and exploration on the large Joaquin property in Argentina as well as initial drilling on two new targets in Argentina called Satélite and Tornado.  Initial drilling on the Raven Vein at Kensington; the first program of drilling on this target conducted by the Company.  Drilling to test extensions of the main north-northeast mineralized trends from Nevada Packard at Rochester. Coeur plans to spend $20.7 million in exploration during 2011 with approximately 84% of the budget earmarked for expansion of ore reserves and mineralized material at or near its existing operations at San Bartolomé (Bolivia), Martha (Argentina), Palmarejo (Mexico), Kensington (Alaska), Rochester (Nevada), and on its large exploration land holdings in Santa Cruz, Argentina. 39 Mexico Exploration in Mexico was focused primarily in the Palmarejo district in the state of Chihuahua. A total of $8.1 million was spent on the program in 2010 on mapping, sampling, drill target generation and drilling to find and define new silver and gold mineralization. A total of 59,338 meters (194,678 feet) was completed at Palmarejo consisting of 34,498 meters (113,182 feet) on surface and underground platforms around the current Palmarejo surface and underground mine. The remainder was devoted to the Guadalupe deposit area and other, new, targets in the Palmarejo district. The budget for 2011 for exploration in Mexico is similar to 2010 at $8.5 million of which nearly 89% is to be allocated to Palmarejo. In 2010 the company agreed to sell its interest in 8 mining concessions at the El Realito property, which is located about 30 kilometers south of the Palmarejo mill facilities, for a total of $0.5 million and a graduated net smelter return royalty. USA  Kensington Exploration in 2010 consisted of drilling 35 core holes, totaling 21,539 feet (6,565 meters), at Kensington. This work was devoted to the Raven vein which is parallel to and approximately 2,000 feet (600 meters) west of the main Kensington mine area. The Company plans for an additional drilling program in 2011 on Raven and other targets with a budget of $2.9 million. USA  Rochester The Company conducted a drilling program at the Nevada Packard deposit area in 2010. This program, amounting to 13,980 feet (4,261 meters) of angled, reverse circulation drill holes, was focused on testing northern extensions of the main mineralized trends in the Nevada Packard deposit. The Company has allocated $0.4 million for exploration in 2011 at the greater Rochester property, including follow-up on 2010 drilling results at Nevada Packard. Chile  Other Properties The 2011 exploration budget for Chile is expected to be $0.4 million. In 2010 the Company agreed to sell its wholly-owned Puchuldiza gold property in northern Chile for a total of $1.5 million cash, 500,000 paid up shares of Southern Legacy Inc., and a 1.5% net smelter return royalty on future mineral production with a cap of $5.0 million. Argentina  Martha Mine In 2010, the Companys exploration efforts at the Martha Mine consisted of 7,274 feet (2,217 meters) of core drilling in several locations around the mine. Argentina  Other Properties The Company also continued exploration in other parts of the Santa Cruz Province. Activities focused on the Joaquin, Tornado and Satélite properties. A total of over 62,228 feet of drilling (18,967 meters) was completed on these three areas. Drilling at Joaquin during 2010 continued to return encouraging results on two targets: La Negra and La Morocha. Joaquin is located about 80 kilometers north of the Martha mine, and the Company has an option to earn up to a 71% managing interest in a joint venture with property owners Mirasol Resources Ltd. Additional exploratory and definition drilling will continue in 2011 on in this property. In 2010, the company met its obligations, under its agreement with Mirasol, to earn an initial 51% joint venture interest in the 92+ square mile (24,000+ hectare) property. The Company has budgeted $6.1 million for exploration during 2011 in Argentina, including on Martha, Joaquin, Tornado, and Satélite. 40 Africa, Tanzania During 2010 the company continued to wind-down its activities in Tanzania.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Coeur dAlene Mines Corporation and its subsidiaries for the three years ended December 31, 2010. It consists of the following subsections:  Overview which provides a brief summary of the Companys financial position and the primary factors affecting those results.  Critical Accounting Policies which provides a discussion of the accounting policies Coeur considers critical because of their effect on the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and/or expenses in the Companys consolidated financial statements and/or because they require different objectives or complex judgments by management.  Operating statistics and ore reserve estimates which provides a summary of the consolidated production results for the three years ended December 31, 2010 and discussion of Coeurs reported ore reserves.  Results of operations which sets forth an analysis of the operating results for the last three years.  Liquidity and capital resources which contains a discussion of the Companys cash flows and liquidity, investing activities and financing activities, contractual obligations and environmental compliance expenditures.  Recently issued accounting pronouncements, which summarizes recently published authoritative accounting guidance, how it might apply to Coeur, and how it might affect the Companys future results. 44 Overview The Company is a large primary silver producer with growing gold production and has assets located in the United States, Mexico, Bolivia, Argentina and Australia. The San Bartolomé mine, Palmarejo mine, Kensington mine, Rochester mine, and Martha mine, each of which is operated by the Company, and the Endeavor mine, which is operated by a non-affiliated party, constituted the Companys principal sources of mining revenues during 2010. The Kensington mine, the Companys newest operating mine, began processing ore on June 24, 2010 and began commercial production July 3, 2010. The Company sold its Cerro Bayo mine in Chile in August 2010. Coeur is an Idaho corporation incorporated in 1928. The Companys business strategy is to discover, acquire, develop and operate low-cost silver and gold operations that will produce long-term cash flow, provide opportunities for growth through continued exploration, and generate superior and sustainable returns for shareholders. The Companys management focuses on maximizing cash flow from its existing operations, the main elements of which are silver and gold prices, cash costs of production and capital expenditures. The Company also focuses on reducing its non-operating costs in order to maximize cashflow. The results of the Companys operations are significantly affected by fluctuation in prices of silver and gold, which may fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond its control, including interest rates, expectations regarding inflation, currency values, governmental decisions regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles, global and regional political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, The company faces challenges including raising capital, increasing production and managing social, political and environmental issues. Operating costs at the Companys mines are subject to variation due to a number of factors such as changing commodity prices, ore grades, metallurgy, revisions to mine plans and changes in accounting principles. At foreign locations, operating costs are also influenced by currency fluctuations that may affect its U.S. dollar costs. Highlights during 2010:  Silver and gold prices averaged $20.15 per ounce and $1,225 per ounce in 2010, respectively. Silver hit a high of $30.64 per ounce on December 29, 2010 and a low of $14.78 per ounce on February 5, 2010. Gold hit a high of $1,421.00 per ounce on November 9, 2010 and a low of $1,058.00 per ounce on February 5, 2010.  The Company produced a total of 16.8 million ounces of silver during 2010, which was a 0.6% decrease from 2009. The Company produced 157,062 ounces of gold during 2010, which was a 117.8% increase over 2009.  The Company experienced a 71.6% increase in metal sales to $515.5 million.  Net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 was $165.6 million, compared to $60.1 million in 2009.  The Company spent $156.0 million in capital expenditures, which represents a 28.5% decrease from 2009.  The Kensington mine began processing ore on June 24, 2010 and began commercial production July 3, 2010. Kensington produced 43,143 ounces of gold during 2010.  San Bartolomé produced 6.7 million ounces of silver during 2010, with cash operating costs of $7.87 per silver ounce. See discussion in
