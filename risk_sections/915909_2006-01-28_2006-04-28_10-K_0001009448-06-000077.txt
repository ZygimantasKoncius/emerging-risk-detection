Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Dependence on Tajima For the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006, approximately 75.5% of the Company's revenues resulted from the sale of embroidery equipment supplied by Tajima. Two separate distributorship agreements (collectively, the "Tajima Agreements") govern the Company's rights to distribute Tajima embroidery equipment in the United States and the Caribbean. The distributorship agreements with Tajima collectively provide the Company with the exclusive rights to distribute Tajima's complete line of standard embroidery, chenille embroidery and certain specialty embroidery machines in 50 states. The Main Agreement, which now covers 39 states, is effective from February 21, 2004 through February 21, 2011. The Main Agreement may be terminated by Tajima and/or the Company on not less than two years' prior notice. Under the non-exclusive West Coast Agreement which covers nine western continental states, Alaska and Hawaii, the Company is a distributor of Tajima's complete line of standard embroidery, chenille embroidery and certain specialty embroidery. The West Coast Agreement expired February 20, 2005. The Company is in the process of negotiating an extension of the West Coast Agreement, however, there can be no assurance that an agreement can be reached on terms acceptable to the Company. The failure of the Company to obtain an extension of the West Coast Agreement on terms acceptable to the Company could result in a loss of the Company's right to distribute embroidery machines in the territories covered by the West Coast Agreement which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operations and financial condition. Each of the agreements contains language that permits termination if the Company fails to achieve certain minimum sales quotas or annual targets. In fiscal 2006, the Company met its sales quotas and in fiscal 2005, the Company obtained a waiver from Tajima for failure to meet its sales quotas. Furthermore, the agreements may be terminated for, among other reasons, if (a) Henry Arnberg is no longer Chairman and/or CEO of the Company or (b) if Tajima determines that a change in control of the Company has occurred. The termination of the Tajima agreements would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Importing Tajima's equipment from Japan subjects the Company to risks of engaging in business overseas, including international political and economic conditions, changes in the exchange rates between currencies, tariffs, foreign regulation of trade with the United States, and work stoppages. The interruption of supply or a significant increase in the cost of Tajima equipment for any reason could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, Tajima manufactures its embroidery machines in several locations in Japan. The Company could be materially and adversely affected should any of these facilities be seriously damaged as a result of a fire, natural disaster or otherwise. Further, the Company could be materially and adversely affected should Tajima be subject to adverse market, business or financial conditions. Embroidery machines produced by Tajima are subject to competition from the introduction by other manufacturers of technological advances and new products. Current competitors or new market entrants could introduce products with features that render products sold by the Company and products developed by Tajima less marketable. The Company relies on Tajima's embroidery equipment to be of the highest quality and state of the art. The Company's future success will depend, to a certain extent, on the ability of Tajima to adapt to technological change and address market needs, including price competition. There can be no assurance that Tajima will be able to keep pace with technological change in the embroidery industry, the current demands of the marketplace or compete favorably on price. The failure of Tajima to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial conditions and results of operations. Decline in Domestic Embroidery Industry Beginning in fiscal 1999 and continuing to present day, the embroidery industry experienced; (i) a decline in demand for large embroidery machines, and; (ii) a trend toward the relocation of manufacturing facilities to Mexico, the Caribbean, Far East and South America (which is outside of the geographic area the Company is authorized to distribute embroidery machines pursuant to the distribution agreements with Tajima), all of which have had a material adverse effect on the operations of the Company, its business and financial condition. A decrease in consumer preferences for embroidered products, a general economic downturn or other events having an adverse effect on the embroidery industry as a whole would also have an adverse effect on the Company. Foreign Currency Risks The Company pays for its Tajima embroidery machinery in Japanese Yen. Any change in the valuation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Japanese Yen can change the cost to the Company of its embroidery machine inventory and can result in competitive pressures for reduced US dollar pricing among Yen-based equipment distributors and manufacturers. The Company has generally been able to recover increased costs through price increases to its customers or, in limited circumstances, price reductions from Tajima; however, dollar price reductions do reduce dollar contribution margins and as a result create overhead coverage pressure. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to recover such increased costs in the future or reduce overheads to the necessary degree to obtain profitability. The failure on the part of the Company to do so could have a material adverse effect on the business, operations and financial condition. These transactions are not currently hedged through any derivative currency product. Currency gains and losses in foreign exchange transactions are recorded in the statement of operations. Inventory The Company's ordering cycle for new embroidery machines is approximately three to eight months prior to delivery to the Company. Since the Company generally delivers new Tajima embroidery machines to its customers within one week of receiving orders, it orders inventory based on past experience and forecasted demand. Due to the relatively long lead times of the ordering cycle, any significant unanticipated downturn or upturn in equipment sales could result in an increase in inventory levels or shortage of product, respectively, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Competition The Company competes with distributors of embroidery machines produced by manufacturers other than Tajima and with manufacturers who distribute their embroidery machines directly as well as with other providers of embroidery products and services. The Company believes that competition in the embroidery industry is based on technological capability and quality of embroidery machines, price and service. If other manufacturers develop embroidery machines which are more technologically advanced than Tajima's or if the quality of Tajima embroidery machines diminishes, the Company would not be able to compete as effectively which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company also faces competition in selling software, embroidery supplies, accessories and proprietary products as well as providing customer training, support and services. Due to the decline in overall demand in the industry which occurred during the last several years, potential customers may emphasize price differences over value-added services and support in purchasing new embroidery machines. Severe price competition may impair the Company's ability to provide its customers with value-added services and support. Although the Company attempts to compete on the basis of price, to the best degree possible, and to maintain profit margins, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so. The Company's failure to compete effectively in these areas could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Dependence on Existing Management Changes in the embroidery industry and recent restructuring of the Company's business have resulted in increased responsibilities for management and have placed increased demands upon the Company's operating, financial and technical resources. The Company's continued success will depend to a significant extent upon the abilities and continued efforts of Henry Arnberg, Chairman of the Board of the Company, and Paul Gallagher, its Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Gallagher is bound by a 2 year agreement that commenced on September 11, 2004. It should also be noted that the Distribution Agreements with Tajima provide that Tajima may terminate each agreement for, among other reasons, if (a) Henry Arnberg is no longer Chairman and/or CEO of the Company or (b) if Tajima determines that a change in control of the Company has occurred. The loss of the services of Messrs. Arnberg or Gallagher, or the services of other key management personnel, could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 1B.
