Business Overview Barnwell enjoyed its 50th year of operations in fiscal 2006, having been incorporated in Delaware in 1956. Barnwell has the following three principal business segments: · Oil and Natural Gas Segment. Barnwell engages in oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and sales, primarily in Canada. · Land Investment Segment. Barnwell invests in leasehold interests in real estate in Hawaii. · Contract Drilling Segment. Barnwell provides well drilling services, contract labor servicing for geothermal well drilling and workovers, and water pumping system installation and repair in Hawaii. Barnwells oil and natural gas activities comprise its largest business segment. Approximately 66% of Barnwells revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 was attributable to its oil and natural gas activities. Barnwells land investment segment revenues accounted for 21% of fiscal 2006 revenues; Barnwells contract drilling activities accounted for 10% of fiscal 2006 revenues; and other revenues comprised 3% of fiscal 2006 revenues. Approximately 98% of Barnwells capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 was attributable to oil and natural gas activities and 2% was applicable to its other activities. Oil and Natural Gas Segment Overview Barnwells wholly-owned subsidiary, Barnwell of Canada, Limited (Barnwell of Canada), is involved in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties. Barnwell of Canada initiates and participates in exploratory and developmental operations for oil and natural gas on property in which it has an interest, and evaluates proposals by third parties with regard to participation in such exploratory and developmental operations elsewhere. Operations Barnwells investments in oil and natural gas properties consist of investments in Canada, principally in the Province of Alberta, with minor holdings in the Provinces of Saskatchewan and British Columbia. These property interests are principally held under governmental leases or licenses. Under the typical Canadian provincial governmental lease, Barnwell must perform exploratory operations and comply with certain other conditions. Lease terms vary with each province, but, in general, the terms grant Barnwell the right to remove oil, natural gas and related substances subject to payment of specified royalties on production. 4 Barnwell initiates and participates in exploratory and developmental operations for oil and natural gas on property in which it has an interest. Barnwell also evaluates proposals by third parties for participation in other exploratory and developmental opportunities. All exploratory and developmental operations are overseen by Barnwells Calgary, Alberta staff along with senior management and independent consultants as necessary. In fiscal 2006, Barnwell participated in exploratory and developmental operations in the Canadian Province of Alberta, although Barnwell does not limit its consideration of exploratory and developmental operations to this area. The Province of Alberta determines its royalty share of natural gas and of oil by using reference prices that average all natural gas sales and oil sales, respectively, in Alberta. Royalty rates are calculated on a sliding scale basis, increasing as prices increase up to a maximum royalty rate of 35%. Additionally, Barnwell pays gross overriding royalties and leasehold royalties on a portion of its natural gas and oil sales to parties other than the Province of Alberta. In fiscal 2006 and 2005, the weighted-average rate of all royalties paid on all of Barnwells natural gas was approximately 28% and 27%, respectively. The weighted-average rate of all royalties paid to governments and others on natural gas from the Dunvegan Unit, Barnwells principal oil and natural gas property, was approximately 30% and 31% in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in royalty rate on all properties was primarily due to higher average natural gas prices. The increase was partially offset by the lower average royalty rate at Dunvegan in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 which was due to royalty credits received from the Alberta Department of Energy for prior year capital and operating expenditures incurred by Barnwell on the Dunvegan property for the processing of natural gas. In fiscal 2006 and 2005, the weighted-average royalty rate paid on oil was approximately 23% and 24%, respectively. The decrease in the weighted-average royalty rate on oil was primarily due to a higher percentage of Barnwells fiscal 2006 production of oil coming from newer wells where royalties are assessed at a lower rate than on older wells. Prices of natural gas are typically higher in the winter than at other times due to demand for heating. Prices of oil are also subject to seasonal fluctuations, but to a lesser degree. Unit sales of oil and natural gas are based on the quantity produced from the properties by the operator. During periods of low demand for natural gas, the operator of the Dunvegan property may re-inject natural gas into underground storage facilities for delivery at a future date. Well Drilling Activities During fiscal 2006, Barnwell participated in the drilling of 40 gross development wells and seven gross exploratory wells, of which management believes 40 should be capable of production and seven are dry holes. 5 The following table sets forth more detailed information with respect to the number of exploratory (Exp.) and development (Dev.) wells drilled for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006, 2005, and 2004 in which Barnwell participated: Productive Productive Total Productive Oil Wells Gas Wells Wells Dry Holes Total Wells Exp.

For example, a 50% interest in a well represents one gross well, but 0.5 net well. The gross figure includes interests owned of record by Barnwell and, in addition, the portion owned by others. Barnwell invested $25,949,000 in oil and natural gas properties during fiscal 2006, of which $3,273,000 (13%) was for acquisition of leases and lease rentals, $1,870,000 (7%) was for geological and geophysical costs, $15,878,000 (61%) was for intangible drilling costs, $4,328,000 (17%) was for production equipment, and $600,000 (2%) was for future site restoration and abandonment and other costs. The major areas of investments in fiscal 2006 were in the Progress, Pouce Coupe South, Simonette, Dunvegan, Swalwell, Josephine, Bonanza/Balsam, and Doris areas of Alberta. The Dunvegan Unit, in which Barnwell holds an 8.9% working interest, is Barnwells principal oil and natural gas property and is located in Alberta, Canada. At September 30, 2006, the Dunvegan Unit had 197 producing natural gas wells. In fiscal 2006, Barnwell participated in the drilling of 12 gross (1.1 net) development gas wells in the Dunvegan area, all of which were successful. Total capital expenditures at Dunvegan were $1,781,000 in fiscal 2006 as compared to $4,299,000 and $3,670,000 in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Barnwell expects that fiscal 2007 capital expenditures at Dunvegan will decline slightly from fiscal 2006s level with the anticipated drilling of 10 gross (0.9 net) development gas wells. Capital expenditures totaled $917,000 in the Doris area in fiscal 2006 as compared to $2,023,000 in fiscal 2005. One gross (0.5 net) well was drilled in fiscal 2006 which is currently considered successful. In the Doris area Barnwell acquired oil and natural gas rights in 3,840 gross (2,240 net) acres of undeveloped land in fiscal 2006. At September 30, 2006 Barnwells average working interest in its productive wells in the Doris area was 46%. Barnwell expects to drill two to four gross wells in the Doris area in fiscal 2007. Capital expenditures totaled $850,000 in the Bonanza/Balsam area in fiscal 2006 as compared to $1,987,000 in fiscal 2005. Two gross (0.6 net) wells were drilled in fiscal 2006 which were 6 successful and tied in and producing at September 30, 2006. In the Bonanza/Balsam area Barnwell acquired oil and natural gas rights in 1,920 gross (940 net) acres of undeveloped land in fiscal 2006. At September 30, 2006 Barnwells average working interest in its productive wells in the Bonanza/Balsam area was 31%. Capital expenditures totaled $6,094,000 in the Progress area in fiscal 2006 as compared to $1,670,000 in fiscal 2005. Three gross (1.7 net) wells were drilled in fiscal 2006 of which one gross (0.4 net) well was successful and tied in and producing at September 30, 2006 and two gross (1.3 net) wells were successful but awaiting tie-in. In the Progress area Barnwell acquired oil and natural gas rights in 640 gross (420 net) acres of undeveloped land in fiscal 2006. At September 30, 2006 Barnwells average working interest in its productive wells in the Progress area was 37%. Barnwell plans on drilling four to six gross wells in the Progress area in fiscal 2007. Capital expenditures totaled $867,000 in the Wood River area in fiscal 2006 as compared to $531,000 in fiscal 2005. Two gross (0.3 net) wells were successfully drilled in fiscal 2006. At September 30, 2006 Barnwells average working interest in its productive wells in the Wood River area was 13%. Barnwell expects to drill three gross wells in the Wood River area in fiscal 2007. Capital expenditures totaled $2,101,000 in the Pouce Coupe South area in fiscal 2006 as compared to $173,000 in fiscal 2005. Two gross (0.9 net) wells were successfully drilled in fiscal 2006. At September 30, 2006 Barnwells average working interest in its productive wells in the Pouce Coupe South area was 53%. Barnwell plans on drilling two gross wells in the Pouce Coupe South area in fiscal 2007. Capital expenditures totaled $1,890,000 in the Simonette area in fiscal 2006. One gross (0.1 net) well was successful and one gross (0.5 net) well drilled in fiscal 2005 initially estimated to be productive was determined to be unsuccessful. Capital expenditures totaled $1,102,000 in the Swalwell area in fiscal 2006 where oil and natural gas rights in 3,360 gross (3,350 net) acres of undeveloped land were acquired and where one gross (0.3 net) unsuccessful well was drilled. Capital expenditures totaled $1,101,000 in the Josephine area in fiscal 2006, a new area for Barnwell, where oil and natural gas rights in 640 gross (420 net) acres of undeveloped land were acquired and where one gross (0.5 net) successful well was drilled. Barnwells average working interest in wells drilled in fiscal 2006 was approximately 29%, as compared to 17% in fiscal 2005 and 10% in fiscal 2004. The increase in fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005 was due to Barnwell taking a higher working interest in projects that were internally developed and initiated. In fiscal 2006, Barnwell initiated 28 gross (11.7 net) wells as compared to 27 gross (8.8 net) wells in fiscal 2005. The increase in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004, was principally due to an 81 gross (2.7 net) well shallow gas drilling program in fiscal 2004 in the Hilda area, where Barnwells interest averaged 3.3%, reducing Barnwells average net interest in fiscal 2004. 7 Oil and Natural Gas Production The following table summarizes (a) Barnwells net unit production for the last three fiscal years, based on sales of crude oil, natural gas, condensate and other natural gas liquids, from all wells in which Barnwell has or had an interest, and (b) the average sales prices and average production costs for such production during the same periods. Production amounts reported are net of royalties and the Alberta Royalty Tax Credit. Barnwells net production in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 was derived primarily from the Province of Alberta. Year Ended September 30, 2006 2005 2004 Annual net production: Natural gas liquids (BBLS)* 115,000 114,000 105,000 Oil (BBLS)* 145,000 139,000 154,000 Natural gas (MCF)* 3,629,000 3,621,000 3,383,000 Annual average sale price per unit of production: BBL of natural gas liquids** $ 40.18 $ 31.84 $ 24.18 BBL of oil** $ 56.85 $ 48.11 $ 33.24 MCF of natural gas*** $ 6.67 $ 5.93 $ 4.60 Annual average production cost per MCFE produced**** $ 1.45 $ 1.20 $ 1.11 Annual average depletion cost per MCFE produced***** $ 2.17 $ 1.66 $ 1.31 * When used in this report, the term BBL(S) means stock tank barrel(s) of oil equivalent to 42 U.S. gallons and the term MCF means 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas at 14.65 pounds per square inch absolute and 60 degrees F. ** Calculated on revenues before royalty expense and Alberta Royalty Tax Credit divided by gross production. *** Calculated on revenues net of pipeline charges before royalty expense and Alberta Royalty Tax Credit divided by gross production. **** Natural gas liquids, oil and natural gas units were combined by converting barrels of natural gas liquids and oil to an MCF equivalent (MCFE) on the basis of 1 BBL = 5.8 MCF. Excludes natural gas pipeline charges. ***** Natural gas liquids, oil and natural gas units were combined by converting barrels of natural gas liquids and oil to an MCF equivalent (MCFE) on the basis of 1 BBL = 5.8 MCF. In fiscal 2006, approximately 66%, 22% and 12% of Barnwells oil and natural gas revenues were from the sale of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids, respectively. In fiscal 2006, Barnwells net production after royalties for natural gas averaged 9,940 MCF per day, a slight increase from 9,920 MCF per day in fiscal 2005. Gross natural gas production also increased 1% in fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005. Dunvegan contributed approximately 50% of Barnwells net natural gas production in fiscal 2006, an increase from 48% in fiscal 2005 due to the new wells drilled at Dunvegan. Barnwells major oil producing properties are the Red Earth, Chauvin and Bonanza/Balsam areas in Canada. In fiscal 2006, net production after royalties for oil averaged 400 barrels per day, an 8 increase of 5% from 380 barrels per day in fiscal 2005. This increase was principally due to the addition of new wells in the Wood River and Progress areas which offset decreased production from the Bonanza/Balsam and Red Earth areas caused by natural declines from existing wells. In fiscal 2006, net production after royalties for natural gas liquids averaged 320 barrels per day, an increase of 3% from 310 barrels per day in fiscal 2005. This increase was due to higher Dunvegan production which increased 8% or 19 barrels per day. Dunvegan contributed approximately 87% of Barnwells net natural gas liquids production in fiscal 2006. The average production cost per MCFE was $1.45 for fiscal 2006, a 21% increase from $1.20 for fiscal 2005. Actual field costs increased by 12% due to industry-wide increases in costs for oilfield services and utilities in Canada and a 7% increase in the average exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005. The average depletion cost per MCFE was $2.17 for fiscal 2006, a 31% increase from $1.66 for fiscal 2005. The increase was due to a 22% increase in the depletion rate and a 7% increase in the average exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar. The 22% increase in the depletion rate was due to an increase in Barnwells costs of finding and developing new proven reserves, and costs that are incurred to maintain production from existing reserves. Barnwells cost of finding and developing proven reserves has increased as the costs of oil and natural gas exploration and development has increased in Canada, and increased capital costs attributed to existing reserves. In fiscal 2005, approximately 68%, 21% and 11% of Barnwells oil and natural gas revenues were from the sale of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids, respectively. In fiscal 2005, Barnwells net production after royalties for natural gas averaged 9,920 MCF per day, an increase of 7% from 9,240 MCF per day in fiscal 2004. Gross natural gas production also increased 7% in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004. Dunvegan contributed approximately 48% of Barnwells net natural gas production in fiscal 2005, an increase from 44% in fiscal 2004 due to the new well drilling at Dunvegan. In fiscal 2005, net production after royalties for oil averaged 380 barrels per day, a decrease of 10% from 420 barrels per day in fiscal 2004. This decrease was principally due to natural production declines at Red Earth. In fiscal 2005, net production after royalties for natural gas liquids averaged 310 barrels per day, an increase of 7% from 290 barrels per day in fiscal 2004. This increase was due to higher Dunvegan production which increased 12% or 29 barrels per day. Dunvegan contributed approximately 82% of Barnwells net natural gas liquids production in fiscal 2005. The average production cost per MCFE was $1.20 for fiscal 2005, an 8% increase from $1.11 for fiscal 2004. The increase was due to an 8% increase in the average exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004. The average depletion cost per MCFE was $1.66 for fiscal 2005, a 27% increase from $1.31 for fiscal 2004. The increase was due to a 17% increase in the depletion rate and an 8% increase in the average exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar. 9 Productive Wells The following table sets forth the gross and net number of productive wells Barnwell has an interest in as of September 30, 2006. Productive Wells* Gross** Net** Location Oil Gas Oil Gas Canada Alberta 152 577 26.4 64.2 Saskatchewan 7 30 0.3 5.0 British Columbia 2 1 0.5  Total 161 608 27.2 69.2 * Twenty-four natural gas wells have dual or multiple completions. ** Please see note (2) on the following table. Developed Acreage and Undeveloped Acreage The following table sets forth certain information with respect to oil and natural gas properties of Barnwell as of September 30, 2006. Developed and Developed Undeveloped Undeveloped Acreage(1) Acreage(1) Acreage(1) Location Gross(2) Net(2) Gross(2) Net(2) Gross(2) Net(2) Canada Alberta 237,226 36,150 244,767 114,575 481,993 150,725 British Columbia 1,597 476 3,490 1,115 5,087 1,591 Saskatchewan 3,140 426   3,140 426 Total 241,963 37,052 248,257 115,690 490,220 152,742 (1) Developed Acreage includes the acres covered by leases upon which there are one or more producing wells. Undeveloped Acreage includes acres covered by leases upon which there are no producing wells and which are maintained in effect by the payment of delay rentals or the commencement of drilling thereon. (2) Gross also refers to the total number of acres or wells in which Barnwell owns an interest, and Net refers to Barnwells aggregate interest therein. For example, a 50% interest in a 320 acre lease represents 320 gross acres and 160 net acres. The gross acreage and well figures include interests owned of record by Barnwell and, in addition, the portion owned by others. Barnwells leasehold interests in its undeveloped acreage expire over the next fiscal years, if not developed, as follows: 7% expire during fiscal 2007; 14% expire during fiscal 2008; 28% expire during fiscal 2009; 25% expire during fiscal 2010; and 15% expire during fiscal 2011. Eleven percent of Barnwells undeveloped acreage is related to heavy oil and therefore not subject to expiration. There can be no assurance that Barnwell will be successful in renewing its leasehold interests in the event of expiration. 10 Barnwells undeveloped acreage includes major concentrations in Alberta, at Bremner (8,640 net acres), Doris (7,392 net acres), Bonanza/Balsam (6,960 net acres), Boundary Lake (6,656 net acres), Swalwell (6,316 net acres), Thornbury (6,261 net acres), Mulligan (5,236 net acres), and Paddle River (5,184 net acres). Reserves The amounts set forth in the table below, prepared by Paddock Lindstrom & Associates Ltd., Barnwells independent reservoir engineering consultants, summarize the estimated net quantities of proved producing reserves and proved reserves of crude oil (including condensate and natural gas liquids) and natural gas as of September 30, 2006, 2005, and 2004 on all properties in which Barnwell has an interest. These reserves are before deductions for indebtedness secured by the properties and are based on constant dollars. No estimates of total proved net oil or natural gas reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal authority or agency, other than the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, since October 1, 2004. Proved Producing Reserves September 30, 2006 2005 2004 Oil  barrels (BBLS) (including natural gas liquids): Dunvegan 404,000 456,000 446,000 All other properties 665,000 646,000 689,000 Total 1,069,000 1,102,000 1,135,000 Natural gas  thousand cubic feet (MCF): Dunvegan 11,503,000 12,947,000 13,796,000 All other properties 7,055,000 8,895,000 7,818,000 Total 18,558,000 21,842,000 21,614,000 Total Proved Reserves (Includes Proved Producing Reserves) September 30, 2006 2005 2004 Oil  barrels (BBLS) (including natural gas liquids): Dunvegan 426,000 489,000 524,000 All other properties 877,000 817,000 780,000 Total 1,303,000 1,306,000 1,304,000 Natural gas  thousand cubic feet (MCF): Dunvegan 12,074,000 13,858,000 15,975,000 All other properties 12,752,000 11,376,000 10,850,000 Total 24,826,000 25,234,000 26,825,000 11 As of September 30, 2006, essentially all of Barnwells proved producing and total proved reserves were located in the Province of Alberta, with minor volumes located in the Provinces of Saskatchewan and British Columbia. During fiscal 2006, Barnwells total net proved reserves, including proved producing reserves, of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids decreased by 3,000 barrels, and total net proved reserves of natural gas decreased by 408,000 MCF. The change in oil, condensate and natural gas liquids reserves during fiscal 2006 was the net result of production during the year of 260,000 barrels, the addition of 190,000 barrels from the drilling of wells, the independent engineers 91,000 upward revision of Barnwells oil reserves and a decrease of 24,000 barrels due to elimination of the Alberta Royalty Tax Credit program effective January 1, 2007. See the Governmental Regulation section herewith for further discussion on the Alberta Royalty Tax Credit program. The change in natural gas reserves during fiscal 2006 was the net result of production during the year of 3,629,000 MCF, the addition of 4,464,000 MCF from the drilling of natural gas wells, the independent engineers 865,000 MCF downward revision of Barnwells natural gas reserves and a decrease of 378,000 MCF due to the elimination of the Alberta Royalty Tax Credit program. Barnwells working interest in the Dunvegan area accounted for approximately 49% and 55% of its total proved natural gas reserves at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and approximately 33% and 37% of total proved oil and natural gas liquids reserves at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The following table sets forth Barnwells oil and natural gas reserves at September 30, 2006, by property name, based on information prepared by Paddock Lindstrom & Associates Ltd. Gross reserves are before the deduction of royalties; net reserves are after the deduction of royalties. This table is based on constant dollars where reserve estimates are based on sales prices, costs and statutory tax rates in existence at the date of the projection. Oil, which includes natural gas liquids (NGL), is shown in thousands of barrels (MBBLS) and natural gas is shown in millions of cubic feet (MMCF). 12 OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 Total Proved Producing Total Proved Oil & NGL Gas Oil & NGL Gas Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Property Name (MBBLS) (MMCF) (MBBLS) (MMCF) Dunvegan 578 404 14,455 11,503 610 426 15,190 12,074 Red Earth 280 242   280 242   Bonanza/Balsam 107 87 411 329 111 90 1,018 826 Pouce Coupe South 7 5 866 695 70 57 2,000 1,603 Medicine River 33 25 783 576 33 25 783 576 Doris   1,273 1,034   1,491 1,221 Faith South       1,011 857 Wood River 40 34 451 387 40 34 689 589 Progress 78 74 418 347 203 179 2,395 1,866 Pouce Coupe 4 4 302 256 4 4 302 256 Other properties 230 194 4,036 3,431 289 246 5,827 4,958 TOTAL 1,357 1,069 22,995 18,558 1,640 1,303 30,706 24,826 Estimated Future Net Revenues The following table sets forth Barnwells Estimated Future Net Revenues from total proved oil, natural gas and condensate reserves and the present value of Barnwells Estimated Future Net Revenues (discounted at 10%). Estimated future net revenues for total proved reserves are net of estimated development costs. Net revenues have been calculated using current sales prices and costs, after deducting all royalties, operating costs, future estimated capital expenditures, and income taxes.

An estimate of fair value would also consider, among other items, the value of Barnwells undeveloped land position, the recovery of reserves not presently classified as proved, anticipated future changes in oil and natural gas prices (these amounts were based on a natural gas price of $3.34 per 1,000 cubic feet as of September 30, 2006) and costs, and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in reserve estimates. 13 Marketing of Oil and Natural Gas Barnwell sells substantially all of its oil and natural gas liquids production under short-term contracts between itself and marketers of oil. The price of oil and natural gas liquids is freely negotiated between the buyers and sellers and is largely determined by the world price for oil, which is principally denominated in U.S. dollars. Natural gas sold by Barnwell is generally sold under both long-term and short-term contracts with prices indexed to market prices. The price of natural gas and natural gas liquids is freely negotiated between buyers and sellers and is principally determined for Barnwell by the North American price for natural gas, which is principally denominated in U.S. dollars. In fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, Barnwell took virtually all of its oil and natural gas in kind where Barnwell markets the products instead of having the operator of a producing property market the products on Barnwells behalf. In fiscal 2006, natural gas production from the Dunvegan Unit was responsible for approximately 50% of Barnwells natural gas revenues, as compared to 46% in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2006, Barnwell had four individually significant marketers that accounted for 69% of Barnwells oil and natural gas revenues. A substantial portion of Barnwells Dunvegan natural gas production and natural gas production from other properties is sold to aggregators and marketers under various short-term and long-term contracts, with the price of natural gas determined by negotiations between the aggregators and the final purchasers. In fiscal 2006, over 90% of Barnwells oil and natural gas revenues were from products sold at spot prices. Governmental Regulation The jurisdictions in which the oil and natural gas properties of Barnwell are located have regulatory provisions relating to permits for the drilling of wells, the spacing of wells, the prevention of oil and natural gas waste, allowable rates of production and other matters. The amount of oil and natural gas produced is subject to control by regulatory agencies in each province that periodically assign allowable rates of production. The Province of Alberta and Government of Canada also monitor and regulate the volume of natural gas that may be removed from the province and the conditions of removal. There is no current government regulation of the price that may be charged on the sale of Canadian oil or natural gas production. Canadian natural gas production destined for export is priced by market forces subject to export contracts meeting certain criteria prescribed by Canadas National Energy Board and the Government of Canada. Different royalty rates are imposed by the provincial governments, the Government of Canada and private interests with respect to the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and liquids. In addition, provincial governments receive additional revenue through the imposition of taxes on crude oil and natural gas owned by private interests within the province. Essentially, provincial royalties are calculated as a percentage of revenue and vary depending on production volumes, selling prices and the date of discovery. In 2002, Canadian taxpayers were not permitted to deduct royalties, taxes, rentals and similar levies paid to the federal or provincial governments in connection with oil and natural gas production in computing income for Canadian federal income tax purposes. However, they were allowed to deduct a Resource Allowance which is 25% of the taxpayers Resource Profits for the Year 14 (essentially, net income from the production of oil, natural gas or minerals) in computing their taxable income. In November 2003, Royal Assent was received on a bill passed by the Parliament of Canada, which was then enacted into law, to reduce Canadas corporate tax rate on resource income (income derived from oil and natural gas operations) over a four-year period beginning January 1, 2003 from 29% to 21% with the 21% tax rate commencing on January 1, 2007. Additionally, the bill phases in over the same four-year period tax deductions for royalties, which previously were not tax deductible, and phases out the Resource Allowance deduction along with other changes. Accordingly, during fiscal 2004, Barnwells Canadian net deferred income tax liabilities were reduced by approximately $1,440,000 due to the reduction in Canadas federal corporate tax rate. Barnwells Canadian net deferred income tax liabilities were also reduced by approximately $300,000 in fiscal 2004 as a result of the Province of Albertas reduction of the provinces corporate tax rate from 13.0% to 12.5%, effective April 1, 2003 (enacted into law in December 2003), and from 12.5% to 11.5%, effective April 1, 2004 (enacted into law in May 2004). In May 2006, a bill reducing the Province of Albertas corporate tax rate from 11.5% to 10.0% effective April 1, 2006 received Royal Assent and was passed into law. In June 2006, Royal Assent was received on a bill passed by the Parliament of Canada which reduces the federal corporate income tax rate to 19% from 21% by 2010 starting January 1, 2008. The federal corporate surtax will also be eliminated effective January 1, 2008. During the year ended September 30, 2006, Barnwells Canadian net deferred income tax liabilities were reduced by approximately $1,094,000 as a result of these reductions in Canadian tax rates. In Alberta, a producer of oil or natural gas is entitled to a credit against the royalties payable to Alberta called the Alberta Royalty Tax Credit (ARTC). The ARTC has been discontinued by the Alberta government effective January 1, 2007. Barnwell received ARTC payments of $438,000, $409,000 and $377,000 in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The ARTC payments were recorded as a credit against oil and natural gas royalties and reported in oil and natural gas revenues. In fiscal 2007, Barnwell expects to receive ARTC payments of approximately $100,000, representing the ARTC for the period from October 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006. Beginning January 1, 2007, Barnwell will no longer receive ARTC payments. Competition The majority of Barnwells natural gas sales take place in Alberta, Canada. Natural gas prices in Alberta are generally competitive with other major North American areas due to increased pipeline capacity into the United States. Barnwells oil and natural gas liquids are sold in Alberta with prices determined by the world price for oil. Barnwell competes in the sale of oil and natural gas on the basis of price, and on the ability to deliver products. The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive in all phases, including the exploration for new production and reserves and the acquisition of equipment and labor necessary to conduct drilling activities. The competition comes from numerous major oil companies as well as numerous other independent operators. There is also competition between the oil and natural gas industry and other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Barnwell is a minor participant in the industry and competes in its oil and natural gas activities with many other companies having far greater financial, technical and other resources. 15 Land Investment Segment Overview Barnwell owns a 77.6% controlling interest in Kaupulehu Developments, a Hawaii general partnership which owns interests in leasehold land and development rights for property located approximately six miles north of the Kona International Airport in the North Kona District of the island of Hawaii. Operations Between 1986 and 1989, Kaupulehu Developments obtained the state and county zoning changes necessary to permit development of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Kaupulehu and Hualalai Golf Club, which opened in 1996, a second golf course, and single-family and multi-family residential units. These projects were developed on leasehold land acquired from Kaupulehu Developments by Kaupulehu Makai Venture, an unrelated entity. The development rights held by Kaupulehu Developments are for residentially-zoned leasehold land within and adjacent to the two golf courses and are under option to Kaupulehu Makai Venture. Kaupulehu Developments later obtained the state and county zoning changes necessary to permit development of single-family and multi-family residential units, a golf course and a limited commercial area on approximately 870 leasehold acres located adjacent to and north of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Kaupulehu. In February 2004, Kaupulehu Developments entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with WB KD Acquisition, LLC (WB) by which Kaupulehu Developments transferred its leasehold interest in the aforementioned 870 acres zoned for resort/residential development, in two increments, to WB. There is no affiliation between Kaupulehu Developments and WB. WB is affiliated with Westbrook Partners, the developers of the nearby Kukio Resort. The first increment (Increment I) is an area planned for approximately 80 single-family lots and a beach club on the portion of the property bordering the Pacific Ocean. The purchasers of the 80 single-family lots will have the right to apply for membership in the Kukio Resort Golf and Beach Club, which is located adjacent to and south of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Kaupulehu. The second increment (Increment II) is the remaining portion of the approximately 870-acre property and is zoned for single-family and multi-family residential units and a golf course and clubhouse. With respect to Increment I, Kaupulehu Developments received an $11,550,000 payment in February 2004 and is entitled to receive payment of the following percentages of the gross proceeds generated from the sale by WB of single-family lots in Increment I (Percentage Payments): 9% of the gross proceeds from single-family lot sales up to aggregate gross proceeds of $100,000,000; 10% of such aggregate gross proceeds greater than $100,000,000 but less than $300,000,000; and 14% of such aggregate gross proceeds in excess of $300,000,000. Minimum amounts of these Percentage Payments are due by certain dates. There is no assurance that any future payments will be received. 16 WB also agreed to pay Kaupulehu Developments subsequent to February 2004 interim payments of $50,000 per month (Interim Payments) up to a total of $900,000. Kaupulehu Developments received the $900,000 in full as of August 2005. Activity WB sold the first of the 80 single-family lots under development in Increment I in January 2006. Two additional lots were sold by WB in February 2006 and another two lots were sold in April 2006, bringing total lot sales in fiscal 2006 to five lots. Kaupulehu Developments received Percentage Payments totaling $3,660,000 for these five lot sales. Revenue from the Percentage Payments was reduced by $220,000 of fees related to the sales, resulting in net revenues of $3,440,000 and a $2,688,000 operating profit, after minority interest. There is no assurance that any future payments will be received. In June 2006, Kaupulehu Developments entered into an Agreement (Increment II Agreement) with WB and WB KD Acquisition II, LLC (WBKD) by which Kaupulehu Developments sold its interest in Increment II, representing the remainder of the approximately 870 acres, to WBKD. There is no affiliation between Kaupulehu Developments and WB or WBKD. WB and WBKD are both affiliates of Westbrook Partners, developers of the nearby Kukio Resort. Pursuant to the Increment II Agreement, Kaupulehu Developments received a $10,000,000 payment and is entitled to receive future payments from WBKD based on a percentage of the sales prices of the residential lots, ranging from 3.25% to 14%, to be determined in the future depending upon a number of variables, including whether the lots are sold prior to improvement. The revenue from the $10,000,000 payment was reduced by $600,000 of fees related to the sale, $220,000 in other costs related to the sale, and approximately $2,983,000 of previously capitalized costs relating to Increment II, resulting in net revenues of $6,197,000 and a $4,621,000 operating profit, after minority interest. There is no assurance that any future payments will be received. In addition, under the terms of the Increment II Agreement, WBKD has the exclusive right to negotiate with Kaupulehu Developments with respect to Lot 4C, which is comprised of approximately 1,000 acres of vacant leasehold land zoned conservation located adjacent to Increment II. This right expires in June 2009 or, if before such date WBKD completes any and all environmental assessments and surveys reasonably required to support a petition to the Hawaii State Land Use Commission for reclassification of Lot 4C zoning, in June 2012. In November 2005, Kaupulehu Makai Venture paid Kaupulehu Developments a non-refundable payment of $2,875,000, consisting of $2,656,250 for the exercise of its development rights option due on December 31, 2005 and $218,750 for a portion of its development rights option due on December 31, 2006. The $2,875,000 of option proceeds was reduced by $173,000 of fees related to the sale, resulting in net revenues of $2,702,000 and a $2,111,000 operating profit, after minority interest. There were no other costs deducted from revenues from the sale of development rights in fiscal 2006 as all capitalized costs associated with the development rights were expensed in previous years. The total amount of remaining future development rights option receipts at September 30, 2006, if all options are fully exercised, is $13,062,500, comprised of the balance of $2,437,500 due on December 31, 2006 and four payments of $2,656,250 due on each December 31 of years 2007 to 2010. 17 If any annual option payment is not made, the then remaining development right options will expire. There is no assurance that any portion of the remaining options will be exercised. The interests held by Kaupulehu Developments at September 30, 2006 include the development rights under option, the rights to receive percentage of sales payments, and approximately 1,000 acres of vacant leasehold land zoned conservation, which is under a right of negotiation with WBKD. Competition Barnwells land investment segment is subject to intense competition in all phases of its operations including the acquisition of new properties, the securing of approvals necessary for land rezoning, and the search for potential buyers of property interests presently owned. The competition comes from numerous independent land development companies and other industries involved in land investment activities. The principal factors affecting competition are the location of the project and pricing. Kaupulehu Developments is a minor participant in the land development industry and competes in its land investment activities with many other entities having far greater financial and other resources. For the past few years, Hawaiis economy has experienced positive growth and the South Kohala/North Kona area of the island of Hawaii, the area in which Kaupulehu Developments property is located, has experienced strong demand for residential real estate. This trend continued through fiscal 2006, but at a diminished rate, and, although we cannot be certain, it is not expected to decline significantly in the near term, although there can be no assurance this trend will in fact continue. The price and market for real estate in the South Kohala/North Kona area of the island of Hawaii has historically been cyclical and if the demand for real estate in the area Kaupulehu Developments interests are located were to decrease, Barnwells operating results could be negatively affected. During periods when demand for real estate is low, inventory may turn at slower rates than expected or may be sold at prices lower than anticipated. This could potentially impair Barnwells liquidity and impede its ability to proceed with other planned projects or activities. Contract Drilling Segment Overview Barnwells wholly-owned subsidiary, Water Resources International, Inc. (Water Resources), drills water, water monitoring and geothermal wells of varying depths in Hawaii, installs and repairs water pumping systems, and is the state of Hawaiis distributor for Floway pumps and equipment. Operations Water Resources owns and operates three Spencer-Harris portable rotary drill rigs ranging in drilling capacity from 3,500 feet to 7,000 feet, an IDECO H-35 rotary drill/workover rig and pump installation and service equipment. Additionally, Water Resources leases a three-quarter of an acre maintenance facility in Honolulu, Hawaii and a one acre maintenance and storage facility with 2,800 square feet of interior space in Kawaihae, Hawaii, and maintains an inventory of drilling materials and 18 pump supplies. As of September 30, 2006, Water Resources employed 21 drilling, pump and administrative employees, none of whom are union members. The demand for Water Resources services is primarily dependent upon land development activities in Hawaii. Water Resources markets its services to land developers and government agencies, and identifies potential contracts through public notices, its officers involvement in community activities and referrals. Contracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled or day rate contracts and are negotiated with private entities or obtained through competitive bidding with private entities or local, state and federal agencies. Contract revenues are not dependent upon the discovery of water, geothermal production zones or other similar targets, and contracts are not subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the governmental entities involved. Contracts provide for arbitration in the event of disputes. Water Resources derived 37%, 63%, and 70% of its contract drilling revenues in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, pursuant to federal, State of Hawaii and county contracts. At September 30, 2006, Barnwell had accounts receivable from the State of Hawaii and county entities totaling approximately $754,000. Barnwell has lien rights on wells drilled and pumps installed for federal, State of Hawaii, county and private entities. Water Resources currently operates in Hawaii and is not subject to seasonal fluctuations. Activity In fiscal 2006, Water Resources started six well drilling contracts and four pump installation contracts and completed 11 well drilling contracts and six pump installation contracts. Seven of the completed well drilling contracts and three of the completed pump installation contracts were started in the prior year. Fifty-two percent (52%) of well drilling and pump installation jobs, representing 37% of total contract drilling revenues in fiscal 2006, have been pursuant to government contracts. At September 30, 2006, Water Resources had a backlog of four well drilling contracts and nine pump installation and repair contracts, of which four, two well drilling and two pump installation and repair, were in progress as of September 30, 2006. The dollar amount of Water Resources backlog of firm well drilling and pump installation and repair contracts at November 30, 2006 and 2005 was as follows: 2006 2005 Well drilling $ 3,760,000 $ 2,000,000 Pump installation and repair 1,140,000 1,500,000 $ 4,900,000 $ 3,500,000 All of the contracts in backlog at November 30, 2006 are expected to be completed within fiscal year 2007. 19 Competition Water Resources utilizes rotary drill rigs and competes with other drilling contractors in Hawaii which use drill rigs similar to Water Resources drilling rigs or drilling rigs that drill as quickly as Water Resources equipment but require less labor. These competitors are also capable of installing and repairing vertical turbine and submersible water pumping systems in Hawaii. These contractors compete actively with Water Resources for government and private contracts. Pricing is Water Resources major method of competition; reliability of service is also a significant factor. Competitive pressures are expected to remain high, thus there is no assurance that the quantity of available or awarded jobs which occurred in fiscal 2006 will continue. Summary Financial Information For all Industry Segments Revenues of each industry segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006, 2005, and 2004 are summarized as follows (all revenues were from unaffiliated customers with no intersegment sales or transfers): 2006 2005 2004 Oil and natural gas $ 37,904,000 66 % $ 32,724,000 74 % $ 23,840,000 62 % Contract drilling 5,866,000 10 % 7,644,000 17 % 3,690,000 10 % Land investment 12,339,000 21 % 3,047,000 7 % 10,077,000 26 % Other 765,000 1 % 652,000 2 % 827,000 2 % Revenues from segments 56,874,000 98 % 44,067,000 100 % 38,434,000 100 % Interest income 386,000 1 % 143,000 0 % 106,000 0 % Gain on sale of drill rig 700,000 1 %  0 %  0 % Total revenues $ 57,960,000 100 % $ 44,210,000 100 % $ 38,540,000 100 % For further discussion see Note 12 (SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION) and Note 14 (CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Employees As of September 30, 2006, Barnwell employed 55 employees, 52 of which are on a full-time basis. Twenty-one are employed in contract drilling activities, 20 are employed in oil and natural gas activities, and 14 are members of the corporate and administrative staff. Financial Information about geographic areas Revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area for the three years ended and as of September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 are set forth in Note 12 (SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 20 Available Information We are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwells other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces, nor are they necessarily listed in order of significance. Risks Related to Oil and Gas Segment The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline and refining capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, many of which may have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis. As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues. Our results of operations and financial condition are dependent on the prices received for our oil and natural gas production. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile and have fluctuated widely during recent years in response to many factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, minor changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, 21 the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. Any decline in crude oil or natural gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, borrowing ability, reserves and amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the development of oil and natural gas reserves. Energy prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or in response to such developments. An increase in operating costs or a decline in our production level could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Higher operating costs for our underlying properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us and, therefore, may reduce the price of our common stock. Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation. The level of production from our existing properties may decline at rates greater than anticipated due to unforeseen circumstances, many of which are beyond our control. A significant decline in our production could result in materially lower revenues and cash flow. Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. Our business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Canadian federal and provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oil and gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in the United States and Canada. Barnwells oil and gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in the United States and Canada, such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers health and safety. Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces. Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwells operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada. In fiscal 2006, we derived approximately 66% of our operating revenues from operations in Canada. Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to 22 contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests. Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S. Government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers activities, reducing demand for our products and services. Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations. Tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities. It is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. We are dependent upon future discoveries or acquisitions of oil and gas to maintain our reserves. We actively explore for oil and natural gas reserves. However, future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and may involve substantial costs. Despite this uncertainty or potential cost, discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production. As a result, future oil and natural gas reserves may be dependent on our success in exploiting existing properties and acquiring additional reserves. If our access to capital becomes limited or unavailable, our ability to make the necessary capital investments to maintain or expand our oil and gas reserves will be impaired. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing additional reserves or acquiring additional reserves on terms that meet our investment objectives. Without these reserve additions, our reserves will deplete and as a consequence, either production from, or the average reserve life of, our properties will decline. Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. The value of our common stock depends upon, among other things, the level of reserves of oil and gas. Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain, and the figures herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material. The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others: · historical production in the area compared with production rates from similar producing areas; · future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures; · initial production rates; · production decline rates; · ultimate recovery of reserves; · success of future development activities; · marketability of production; 23 · effects of government regulation; and · other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves. Reserve estimates are based on the relevant factors, assumptions and prices as of the date on which the evaluations are prepared. Many of these factors are subject to change and are beyond our control. If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates. Delays in business operations could adversely affect our distributions. In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by: · restrictions imposed by lenders; · accounting delays; · delays in the sale or delivery of products; · delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system; · blowouts or other accidents; · adjustments for prior periods; · recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; or · the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. Any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks. The industry in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills. A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others. While we maintain reserves for anticipated liabilities and carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable. There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above. We could face substantial losses, if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against, or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive. 24 We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of clean up orders. Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations. For example, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as the Kyoto Protocol, was ratified by the Canadian government in December 2002 and will require, among other things, significant reductions in greenhouse gases. The impact of the Kyoto Protocol on us is uncertain and may result in significant additional costs for our future operations. Although we record a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations. We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time (as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages) is not available on economically reasonable terms. Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow. Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. We may have difficulty financing our planned capital expenditures, which could have an adverse affect on our business. We make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our exploration and development projects. Without additional capital resources, our drilling and other activities may be limited and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. We may not be able to secure additional financing on reasonable terms or at all and financing may not continue to be available to us under our existing financing arrangements. If additional capital resources are unavailable, we may curtail our drilling, development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets under untimely or unfavorable terms. Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves. Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets. If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. 25 Changes in tax and other legislation may adversely affect shareholders. Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our shareholders. Tax authorities having jurisdiction over us may disagree with the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes or could change their administrative practices to our detriment. Risks Related to Real Estate Investment Segment Significant competition in the real estate industry could have an adverse effect on our business. We face competition from other developers on the island of Hawaii, and from other luxury residential properties in Hawaii and the mainland United States. In many cases, our competitors have greater financial and other resources than us. If we are unable to compete with these larger competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected. A downturn in economic conditions and demand for real estate could adversely affect our business. The real estate investment industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes. As a result, revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly. Considerable economic and political uncertainties currently exist that could have adverse effects on consumer buying habits, construction costs, availability of labor and materials and other factors affecting us and the real estate industry in general. Significant expenditures associated with investment in real estate, such as real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance costs and debt payments, cannot generally be reduced even though changes in Hawaiis or the nations economy may cause a decrease in revenues from our properties. Our real estate business is primarily concentrated in the state of Hawaii. As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii. Barnwells land investment business segment is affected by the condition of Hawaiis real estate market. The Hawaii real estate market is affected by Hawaiis economy and Hawaiis tourism industry, as well as the United States economy in general. Any future cash flows from Barnwells land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaiis economy. The future economic growth in certain portions of the island of Hawaii may be adversely affected if its infrastructure, such as roads, airports, medical facilities and schools, are not improved to meet increased demand. There can be no assurance that these improvements will occur. 26 The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and sell properties or realize income from our projects. The occurrence of natural disasters could also cause increases in property and flood insurance rates and deductibles, which could reduce demand for our properties. Increases in interest rates could reduce demand for our real estate. Continued increases in interest rates could reduce the demand for development, particularly land. Increased interest rates could also negatively impact pricing for our products. A reduction in demand or pricing would materially adversely affect our profitability. Our business is subject to extensive regulation which makes it difficult and expensive for us to conduct our operations. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to land use and development and to environmental compliance and permitting obligations, including those related to the use, storage, discharge, emission, and disposal of hazardous materials. Any failure to comply with these laws could result in capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations that could adversely affect present and future operations, or jeopardize our ability to sell the leasehold interest currently held. A portion of future percentage of sales payments could be impaired if the developer of the property is unable to negotiate fee simple interests. In 2006 we sold our leasehold interest in the second of two increments of resort/residential zoned property to an unrelated developer. As a part of the sale, we are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential lots sold in this second increment. Receipt of these percentage of sales payments will be contingent upon the ability of the developer of the leasehold interest in the resort/residential zoned property to successfully negotiate fee simple prices within this second increment. If the developer is unsuccessful in such negotiations, our ability to receive percentage of sales payments on the sales of those lots would be impaired. If we are unable to obtain required land use entitlements at reasonable costs, or at all, our operating results could be adversely affected. We hold the leasehold interest to approximately 1,000 acres of vacant land that is currently zoned conservation. Our success in selling this interest may be contingent upon obtaining the necessary reclassification from the State of Hawaii Land Use Commission and County of Hawaii. Obtaining the necessary reclassification and ministerial approvals is often difficult, costly and may take several years, or more, to complete. Delays or failures to obtain the necessary reclassification approvals may adversely affect our financial results. 27 Environmental and other regulations may have an adverse effect on our business. Our properties are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulations and restrictions that may impose significant limitations. In most cases, approval to develop requires multiple permits which involve a long, uncertain and costly regulatory process. We are involved in joint ventures and are subject to risks associated with joint venture partnerships. We are involved in joint venture relationships and may initiate future joint venture projects. Entering into a joint venture involves certain risks which include: · the inability to exercise voting control over the joint venture; · economic or business interests which are not aligned with our venture partner; and · the inability for the venture partner to fulfill its commitments and obligations due to financial or other difficulties. Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile. A decrease in demand for our services would result in a decrease in our revenues. Demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii. As also noted above, the real estate investment industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes. If we experience a decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts, we may experience decreased revenues and operating results. A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business. A significant portion of our contract drilling water resources division revenues are derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies. Reduced tax revenues in certain regions may limit spending and new development by local municipalities which in turn will affect the demand for our services in these regions. Material reductions in spending by a significant number of municipalities or local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position. Our contract drilling operations face significant competition from companies with greater financial resources. We face competition for our services from a variety of competitors. Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor. Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected. 28 The loss of or damage to key vendor, customer or sub-contractor relationships would adversely affect our operations. Our business is dependent on our relationships with key vendors, customers and sub-contractors. The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negatively affect our business. Entity-Wide Risks The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including: · fluctuations in commodity prices; · variations in results of operations; · announcements by us and our competitors; · legislative or regulatory changes; · general trends in the industry; · general market conditions; and · analysts estimates and other events in the oil and natural gas industry. Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business. In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market. Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. A small number of shareholders, including our executive officers, own a significant amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other shareholders. As of September 30, 2006, three of our investors and our executive officers held approximately 60% of our common stock. The interests of these shareholders may not always coincide with the interests of other shareholders. These shareholders, acting together, have significant influence over all matters submitted to our shareholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of us. These shareholders are able to exercise significant control over our business, policies and affairs. We may be required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2007, which we believe will result in additional expenses and may divert managements attention. The Company may become an accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which would require the Company to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for fiscal 2007. In such event, management would be required to provide with the Companys Annual Report on 29 Form 10-K for the year ending September 30, 2007, its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2007 and our independent registered public accounting firm would be required to provide its attestation report on managements assessment. If such compliance is required, the Company anticipates incurring additional general and administrative expenses and anticipates that its compliance efforts may divert managements time and attention away from other aspects of our business. Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwells results and financial condition. Retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, and the levels of interest rates.
