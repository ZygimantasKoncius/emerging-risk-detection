D. Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Our Business  Our media investment management business may not produce the expected returns and may result in significant losses. As we continue to expand our media investment management business, we expect an increase in our cash needs. However, we expect to generate revenues as we sell the advertising time and other advertising rights secured under the exclusive agency arrangements and expect these revenues to largely offset the cost of revenues incurred under these exclusive agency arrangements. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs through 2013. We have fully repaid the promissory note in the principal amount of US$19.6 million due on January 20, 2011, with an annual interest rate of 4.75%. This promissory note was issued to Mr. He Dang in connection with the investment by Aegis Media. The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31. 2010 2011 2012 (US$ in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 23,441 24,138 293 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 2,667 (5,464 ) (5,469 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 40,053 (7,549 ) (18,697 ) Effect of changes in exchange rate 2,422 4,961 1,056 Net increase/decrease in cash and cash equivalents 68,583 16,086 (22,817 ) Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the year 54,737 123,320 139,406 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year 123,320 139,406 116,589 Operating Activities Our net cash provided by operating activities was US$24.1 million in 2011 compared to US$23.4 million in 2010, primarily as a result of an increase in net income. Increase in accounts receivable in 2011 was partially offset by increase in accounts payable. Our increase in accounts receivables in 2011 was mainly due to the increase in media investment revenue, especially the revenue from Hubei Economics Provincial TV which has a relatively longer accounts receivable collections period during its ramp up stage, which was offset by the increase in accounts payable mainly to CCTV. 70 Table of Contents Our net cash provided by operating activities was US$0.3 million in 2012 compared to net cash provided by operating activities US$24.1 million in 2011, primarily as a result of a decrease in net income, Decrease in notes receivable, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses in 2012 was partially offset by decrease in accounts payable and advances from customers. Our decrease of these accounts in 2012 was mainly due to the decrease in media investment management revenue. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities largely reflects our capital expenditures, which consists of purchases of fixed assets, such as computers and other office equipment. Our net cash provided by investing activities amounted to US$2.7 million in 2010, net cash used in investing activities amounted to US$5.5 million in 2011 and net cash used in investing activities amounted to US$5.5 million in 2012. The cash provided by investing activities in 2010 was mainly due to acquisition of Beijing Vizeum Advertising Co., Ltd. The cash used in investing activities in 2011 was primarily due to acquisition of Clickpro and investments to set up joint ventures of Wasu Digital Co., Ltd and Chongqing Changhui. The cash used in investing activities in 2012 was primarily due to acquisition of fixed assets and set up subsidiaries of Beijing Hongtu Zhuoyue Advertising Co., Ltd. and Beijing Guozhi Travel & Culture Co., Ltd., joint ventures of Guangdong Nanfang Media New Broadcast Co., Ltd. and cost method investment of Shanxi Jiuyuanji Culture Industry Investment Co., Ltd. Financing Activities In 2010, we had net cash provided by financing activities of US$40.1 million, which was mainly due to the proceeds from our initial public offering. In 2011, we had net cash used in financing activities of US$7.5 million, which was primarily consisted of the final payment of previously declared dividend to our shareholder and our share repurchase program starting from September 2011. In 2012, we had net cash used in financing activities of US$18.7 million, which was primarily consisted of the final payment of previously declared dividend to our shareholder and our share repurchase program .

Major Shareholders Please refer to Item 6E. Directors, Senior Management and Employees  Share Ownership. B. Related Party Transactions Private Placements In July 2008, we issued and sold an aggregate of 7,500,000 Series A preferred shares to Dynasty Cayman Limited and Swift Rise International Limited, at an aggregate purchase price of US$30 million. In August 2008, we issued and sold an aggregate of 5,000,000 Series A preferred shares to Chaview Investments Limited at an aggregate purchase price of US$20 million. Each of the purchasers of the Series A preferred shares was an unrelated third party prior to the issuance and sale of the Series A preferred shares. The purchase price was determined through our arms-length negotiation with the investors and was approved by our board of directors. Holders of our Series A preferred shares are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis together with the holder of ordinary shares. In January 2010, in connection with the formation of our consolidated joint venture with Aegis Media, we redeemed an aggregate of 7,500,000 Series A shares previously held by Swift Rise International Limited and Dynasty Cayman Limited for an aggregate amount of approximately US$37.0 million, which consisted of a principal amount of US$30.0 million and a redemption premium amount of US$7.0 million pursuant to the original terms. In addition, we paid accumulated premiums of US$4.4 million on the 5,000,000 Series A preferred shares which remained outstanding. Each outstanding Series A preferred share was automatically converted into one ordinary share upon completion of our initial public offering in May 2010. 82 Table of Contents In connection with the private placement of our Series A preferred shares, we, holders of our Series A preferred shareholders and the holders of our ordinary shares entered into a shareholders agreement, which was amended and restated on January 20, 2010 in connection with the formation of our consolidated joint venture with Aegis Media. See  Consolidated Joint Venture with Aegis Media and  Investment by Aegis Media. Holders of our Series A preferred shares are also entitled to certain registration rights, as amended and restated as of January 20, 2010 including demand registration and Form F-3 or Form S-3 registration, pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the sale of our Series A preferred shares and as amended in connection with the formation of our consolidated joint venture with Aegis Media. Consolidated Joint Venture with Aegis Media In January 2010, we formed a consolidated joint venture with international 4A advertising group Aegis Media to operate its brand Vizeum in China. The legal ownership of all of the outstanding equity interests of Beijing Vizeum are held by Posterscope. Our subsidiary Media Port holds 60% of the outstanding equity interests in Posterscope, which were subscribed for a purchase price of RMB3.6 million. During the two-year period from January 1, 2016, Aegis Media will have the right to acquire a majority of the shares of Posterscope by purchasing from us 11% of the outstanding shares of Posterscope. If Aegis Media so acquires a majority of the shares of Posterscope, then beginning on January 1, 2018, Aegis Media will have the right to purchase an additional number of our shares of Posterscope and we will have the right to sell an additional number of our shares of Posterscope to Aegis Media. In addition, in the ten-year period from January 1, 2024, Aegis Media will have the right to purchase all of our remaining shares of Posterscope and we will have the right to sell all of our remaining shares of Posterscope to Aegis Media. The consideration for the transfers described above will be based on a multiple of the average after-tax profits of Posterscope for the two-year period prior to a transfer. Since its formation, our revenues attributable to the Posterscope joint venture have been historically relatively insignificant. For example, in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010, December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012, our revenues attributable to the Posterscope joint venture were 3.0%, 4.4% and 7.8% respectively. Investment by Aegis Media Concurrent with the formation of our consolidated joint venture with Aegis Media, we issued 12,390,000 ordinary shares to Aegis Media at an aggregate price of approximately US$49.6 million. The proceeds from the issuance were used by us to redeem an aggregate of 7,500,000 Series A preferred shares held by Swift Rise International Limited and Dynasty Cayman Limited for an aggregate amount of approximately US$37.0 million, which consisted of a principal amount of US$30.0 million and a redemption premium amount of US$7.0 million pursuant to the original terms, and to pay accumulated premiums of US$4.4 million on the 5,000,000 Series A preferred shares which remained outstanding. In order to satisfy Aegis Medias desire to hold no less than certain percentage of our share capital, Mr. He Dang agreed to sell to us 4,890,000 ordinary shares beneficially held by him. Aegis Media has agreed that, after our initial public offering, it would not acquire more than 25% of our voting securities without the prior approval of our board of directors. Aegis Media is also entitled to certain registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement. We, Mr. He Dang and certain of his affiliated entities, Aegis Media, and Chaview Investments Limited also entered into a shareholders agreement, amended and restated as of January 20, 2010, under the terms of which we and Mr. He Dang and certain of his affiliated entities have agreed to restrictions on the solicitation of clients and employees of Aegis Media or the consolidated joint venture, and Aegis Media has agreed to restrictions on the solicitation of clients and employees of our company or the consolidated joint venture.
