ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to the Growth of Our Business If we do not continually develop and commercialize new or enhanced products and services, our business may not grow. Our success depends in large part on our continual, timely development and commercialization of new or enhanced products and services that address evolving market requirements and are attractive to customers. The genetic analysis tools market, including the RNA/DNA probe array field, is characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, evolving industry standards and changing customer needs. Standardization of tools and systems for genetic research is still ongoing and we cannot assure you that our products will emerge as the standard for genetic research. Other companies may introduce new technologies, techniques, products or services that render our products or services obsolete or uneconomical. If we do not appropriately innovate and invest in new technologies, then our technologies will become dated and our customers could move to new technologies offered by our competitors. As a result, we are continually looking to develop, license or acquire new or enhanced technologies, products and services to further broaden and deepen our offerings. Some of the factors affecting market acceptance of our products and services include: · availability, quality and price as compared to competitive technologies, products and services; · the functionality of new and existing products and services, and whether they address market requirements; · the timing of introduction of our technologies, products and services as compared to competitive technologies, products and services; · the existence of product defects; · scientists’ and customers’ opinions of the utility of our products and services and our ability to incorporate their feedback into future products and services; · citation of our products in published research; and · general trends in life science research and life science informatics software development. Our new or enhanced technologies, products or services may not be accepted by customers in our target markets. For example, once we have developed or obtained a new technology, we may fail to successfully commercialize new products and services based on that technology, particularly to the extent that our new products and services compete with established technologies or the products and services of more established competitors. Risks relating to product adoptions include the inability to accurately forecast demand and difficulties in managing different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products. Further, many of our current and potential customers have limited budgets. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the successful introduction of new or enhanced products or services will not adversely affect sales of our current products and services or that customers that currently purchase our products or services will increase their aggregate spending as a result of the introduction of new products and services. The Merger Agreement pursuant to which we have agreed to acquire eBioscience may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed. On November 29, 2011, we entered into a Merger Agreement to acquire eBioscience for approximately $330 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Merger Agreement. The merger is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger, including our receipt of financing for the merger. 16 Table of Contents In connection with the Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter with financing sources providing for $190 million of senior secured credit. The conditions to funding these facilities have not been satisfied, and as a result we will not be able to complete the eBioscience acquisition unless the terms of the acquisition and the financing are restructured. We are in discussions with financing sources and with eBioscience but no agreements or understandings have been reached. We have waived eBioscience’s obligations under the non-solicitation provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement and we understand that eBioscience is considering alternatives to the merger. The Merger Agreement may be terminated by either party if the closing of the merger has not occurred by March 31, 2012, so long as a breach of the Merger Agreement by the party seeking to terminate has not been the proximate cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on or before such date. If we cannot successfully reach agreement with the financing sources and eBioscience on a restructured merger, the Merger Agreement may be terminated under its terms. The failure of the merger to be completed may result in negative publicity and/or a negative impression of us in the investment community, may cause our stock price to decline and may adversely affect our relationship with employees, customers and other partners in the business community. Uncertainty associated with the completion of the merger may cause substantial disruptions in our business and eBioscience’s business. Uncertainty associated with the completion of the merger may cause substantial disruptions in our business and eBioscience’s business, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. Among other things, such uncertainty may affect our relationships with customers, potential customers and suppliers and our ability to recruit prospective employees or to retain and motivate existing employees. eBioscience may face similar disruptions to its business, which could have an adverse effect on the combined business if the merger is completed. The adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by further delay in the completion of the merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. Uncertainty about the completion of the merger also may impair our and eBioscience’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger as our employees and those of eBioscience may experience uncertainty about the completion of the merger or their future roles with the combined business if the merger is completed. If our key employees or those of eBioscience depart, we may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees, which could reduce our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger. We are not able to complete the merger unless the terms of the acquisition and the related financing are restructured. If the merger is completed, we may incur a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, or issue a significant amount of common stock or other equity securities, which would dilute our existing stockholders. In connection with the Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter with financing sources providing for $190 million of senior secured credit. The conditions to funding these facilities have not been satisfied, and as a result we will not be able to complete the merger unless the terms of the acquisition and the financing are restructured. Although we are in discussions with financing sources and with eBioscience regarding the possibility of restructuring the committed financing, no agreements or understandings have been reached. If the merger is completed, we may incur a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our borrowing costs. If we incur indebtedness in connection with the merger, we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements. Increased levels of indebtedness may reduce funds available for our investment in product development as well as capital expenditures and other activities, increase our borrowing costs and create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. In addition, we expect the financing agreements governing any debt financing to contain customary restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions that may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. If an event of default occurs under any debt financing agreement, we may be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees. We may not be able to repay all amounts due in the event these amounts are declared due upon an event of default. 17 Table of Contents If we issue a significant amount of common stock or other equity securities in connection with the merger, our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the market price of our common stock may decline. In addition, such an issuance may require the approval of our stockholders, which would further delay the completion of the merger. There can be no assurance that stockholder approval, if required, would be obtained on a timely basis, or at all. If the merger is completed, we will incur significant transaction and merger-related costs. If the merger is completed, we expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses resulting from the merger will be comprised of transaction costs related to the merger and financing arrangements and employment-related costs. We also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset incremental transaction and merger-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. Our growth depends in part on our ability to acquire new businesses and technologies and successfully integrate acquisitions, which may absorb significant resources and may not be successful. As part of our strategy to develop and identify new technologies, products and services, we have made and may continue to acquire new businesses and technologies. Our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, manufacturing and finance. In particular, if our proposed acquisition of eBioscience is completed, its success will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate eBioscience’s business and operations and fully realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from combining our businesses and eBioscience. If we are not able to achieve these objectives following the merger, the anticipated benefits and synergies of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. Our efforts to successfully integrate acquisitions may result in additional expenses and divert significant amounts of management’s time from other projects. Our failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined company could also have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, there is no guarantee that some of the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so. If our acquisitions do not meet our initial expectations, we may record impairment charges. Factors that will affect the success of our acquisitions include: · our ability to retain key employees of the acquired company; · the performance of the acquired business, technology, product or service; · our ability to integrate operations, financial and other systems; · the ability of the combined company to achieve synergies among its constituent companies, such as increasing sales of the combined company’s products and services, achieving expected cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products and services; · any disruption in order fulfillment or loss of sales due to integration processes; · the presence or absence of adequate internal controls and/or significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies; · any decrease in customer and distributor loyalty and product orders caused by dissatisfaction with the combined companies’ product lines and sales and marketing practices, including price increases; and · our assumption of known contingent liabilities that are realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, or unknown liabilities that come to light, to the extent that the realization of any of these liabilities increases our expenses or adversely affects our business or financial position. 18 Table of Contents Emerging market opportunities in molecular diagnostics may not develop as quickly as we expect and we depend on the efforts of our partners to be successful. The clinical applications of our technologies for diagnosing and enabling informed disease management options in the treatment of disease is an emerging market opportunity in molecular diagnostics. At this time, we cannot be certain that molecular diagnostic markets will develop as quickly as we expect. Although we believe that there will be clinical applications of our technologies that will be utilized for diagnosing and enabling informed disease management options in the treatment of disease, there can be no certainty of the technical or commercial success our technologies will achieve in such markets. Our success in the molecular diagnostics market depends in part on our collaborative relationships and the ability of our collaborative partners to achieve regulatory approval for such products in the United States and in overseas markets, and successfully market and sell products using our technologies. Risks Related to Our Sales We face significant competition, and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. We compete with companies that develop, manufacture and market genetic analysis tools for the life science and clinical healthcare markets. We face significant competition as our competitors and new companies develop new, improved or more economical products, services and technologies. The market for our products and services is highly competitive, has high barriers to entry and has several other large companies with significant market share. For example, companies such as Illumina, Inc., Agilent Technologies and Life Technologies Corporation have products for genetic analysis that are directly competitive with certain of our products. In addition, Illumina, Inc., Life Technologies Corporation and Complete Genomics, Inc. also offer DNA sequencing technology which we do not offer. As the costs of DNA sequencing fall, we will face increased competition in certain of our existing and potential markets. We also face competition from established diagnostic companies such as Beckman Coulter, Becton, Dickinson and Company, bioMérieux, Celera Diagnostics, Johnson & Johnson, Gen-Probe Incorporated and Roche Diagnostics, which have made strategic commitments to diagnostics, have financial and other resources to invest in new technologies, and have substantial intellectual property portfolios, substantial experience in new product development and regulatory expertise. In addition, our collaborative partners may compete with us. Many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, many current and potential competitors have greater name recognition, more extensive customer bases and access to proprietary genetic content. Reduction or delay in research and development budgets and government funding may adversely impact our sales. We expect that our revenue in the foreseeable future will be derived primarily from products and services provided to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as a relatively small number of academic, governmental and other research institutions. Our operating results may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by these customers. Factors that could affect the spending levels of our customers include: · changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions; · weakness in the global economy and changing market conditions that affect our customers; · changes in the extent to which the pharmaceutical industry may use genetic information and genetic testing as a methodology for drug discovery and development; · changes in the regulatory environment affecting life science companies and life science research; · impact of consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry; and 19 Table of Contents · cost reduction initiatives of customers. As we implement our strategy to expand into new markets, the size and structure of our current sales, marketing and technical support organizations may limit our ability to sell our products and services. As we implement our strategy to expand into new markets, we may not be able to establish a sales, marketing and technical support organization sufficient to sell, market and support all of our new products, or to cover all of the regions that we target globally. To assist our sales and support activities, we have entered into distribution agreements through certain distributors, principally in markets outside of North America and Europe. In addition, we may enter into distribution arrangements with respect to some of our products that we believe will be better served in such arrangements than our current sales and marketing organizations. We have less control over other third parties on whom we rely for sales, marketing and technical support. In addition, these third parties may decide to develop and sell competitive products or otherwise become our competitors, which could harm our business. Consolidation trends in both our market and many of our customers’ markets have increased competition. There has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for the past several years. We expect this trend toward industry consolidation to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to more variability in operating results and could harm our business. Additionally, there has been a trend toward consolidation in many of the customer markets we sell to, in particular the pharmaceutical industry. Consolidation in our customer markets results in increased competition for important market segments and fewer available accounts, and larger consolidated customers may be able to exert increased pricing pressure on companies in our market. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with collaborative partners, we may have difficulty developing and selling our products and services. Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with key companies as well as with key academic researchers. In particular, we depend on our collaborators for in-licensed technology and components for a variety of our product lines. We collaborate with a number of instrumentation and reagent companies, including Beckman Coulter, CapitalBio Corporation, Genisphere LLC, Life Technologies Corporation, Luminex Corporation, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Takara Bio Inc., New England Biolabs, Inc. and Qiagen GmbH. Some of these collaborators, like Life Technologies Corporation, Takara Bio Inc., New England Biolabs, Inc. and Luminex Corporation, are currently sole suppliers of components of some of our reagent kits but they are also our competitors. Relying on our collaborative relationships is risky to our future success because: · our partners may develop technologies or components competitive with our products and services; · our existing collaborations may preclude us from entering into additional future arrangements; · our partners may not obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner; · some of our agreements may terminate prematurely due to disagreements between us and our partners; · our partners may not devote sufficient resources to the development and sale of our products and services; · our partners may be unable to provide the resources required for us to progress in the collaboration on a timely basis; · our collaborations may be unsuccessful; or · some of our agreements have expired and we may not be able to negotiate future collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms. 20 Table of Contents Risks Related to the Manufacturing of Our Products We depend on a limited number of suppliers. We will be unable to launch or commercialize our products in a timely manner if our suppliers are unable to meet our requirements or if shipments from these suppliers are delayed or interrupted. We outsource the manufacturing of our instruments to a limited number of suppliers. Some of our instruments and other key parts of our product lines, including components of our manufacturing equipment and certain raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are currently only available from a single supplier. Therefore, we depend on our suppliers to supply our instruments, or components of our products, in required volumes, at appropriate quality and reliability levels, and in compliance with regulatory requirements on a timely basis. If supplies from these vendors do not meet our requirements, or were delayed or interrupted for any reason, we would not be able to commercialize our products successfully or in a timely fashion, and our business could be adversely impacted. Our business is dependent on our ability to forecast our needs for components and products in our product lines and our suppliers’ ability to deliver such components and products in time to meet critical manufacturing and product release schedules. Our business could be adversely affected, for example, if suppliers fail to meet product release schedules, if we experience supply constraints, if we fail to negotiate favorable pricing or if we experience any other interruption or delay in the supply chain which interferes with our ability to manufacture our products or manage our inventory levels. We may lose customers or sales if we are unable to meet customer demand for our products on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if we are unable to ensure the proper performance and quality of our products. We produce our products in an innovative and complicated manufacturing process which has the potential for significant variability in manufacturing yields. We have encountered, and may in the future encounter, difficulties in manufacturing our products and, due to the complexity of our products and our manufacturing process, we may experience delays in the manufacture of our products or fail to ensure their proper performance or quality. As we develop new and enhanced products, we must be able to resolve in a timely, cost-effective manner manufacturing issues that may arise from time to time. We base our manufacturing capabilities on our forecasted product mix for the quarter. If the actual product mix varies significantly from our forecast, we may not be able to fill some orders during that quarter, which could adversely impact our financial results. Difficulties in meeting customer, collaborator and internal demand could also cause us to lose customers or require us to delay new product introductions, which could in turn result in reduced demand for our products. We rely on internal quality control procedures to verify our manufacturing processes. Due to the complexity of our products and manufacturing process, however, it is possible that products that do not meet all of our performance specifications may not be identified before they are shipped. If our products do not consistently meet our customers’ performance expectations, demand for our products will decline. In addition, we do not maintain any backup manufacturing capabilities for the production of our products. Any interruption in our ability to continue operations at our existing manufacturing facilities could delay our ability to develop or sell our products, which could result in lost revenue and seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may need to adjust our manufacturing capacity based on business requirements or improvements made to our technological capabilities and there are risks associated with such adjustment. If demand for our products is reduced or if we implement technologies that increase the density or yields of our wafers, our manufacturing capacity could be under-utilized and some of our long-lived assets, including facilities and equipment, may be impaired, which would increase our expenses. In addition, factory planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of long-lived assets including facilities and equipment, and cause us to accelerate depreciation. These changes in demand for our products, and changes in our customers’ product needs, could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results, and, in certain cases, may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage or require us to recognize impairments of our assets. In addition, if demand for our products is reduced or we fail to accurately forecast demand, we could be required to write down inventory since certain of our products have a limited shelf life, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin. 21 Table of Contents We have in the past, and may in the future, adjust our manufacturing capacity based on business requirements, which may include the rationalization of our facilities, including the abandonment of long-lived manufacturing assets and additional charges related to a reduction in capacity. Manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we launch new products in our Singapore and Ohio facilities and rely increasingly upon manufacturing by third parties. We may lose customers if we are unable to manufacture products or if we experience delays in the manufacture of our products as a result of this transition. We may not be able to deliver acceptable products to our customers due to the rapidly evolving nature of genetic sequence information upon which our products are based. The genetic sequence information upon which we rely to develop and manufacture our products is contained in a variety of databases throughout the world. These databases are rapidly expanding and evolving. In addition, the accuracy of these databases and resulting genetic research is dependent on various scientific interpretations and it is not expected that global genetic research efforts will result in standardized genetic sequence databases for particular genomes in the near future. Although we have implemented ongoing internal quality control efforts to help ensure the quality and accuracy of our products, the fundamental nature of our products requires us to rely on genetic sequence databases and scientific interpretations which are continuously evolving. As a result, these variables may cause us to develop and manufacture products that incorporate sequence errors or ambiguities. The magnitude and importance of these errors will depend upon multiple and complex factors that would be considered in determining the appropriate actions required to remedy any inaccuracies. Our inability to timely deliver acceptable products as a result of these factors would likely adversely affect our relationship with customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Operations We may not achieve sustained profitability. Prior to 2002, we incurred losses each year since our inception, and we reported losses in 2006, and from 2008 through 2011. As a result, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $478.7 million as of December 31, 2011. Our ability to achieve sustained profitability will depend, in part, on the rate of growth, if any, of our revenue and on the level of our expenses. In 2011, our business was affected by a significant drop in the volume of sales and consumables to our academic and pharmaceutical customers, particularly in North America, which led to a decrease in revenue as compared to 2010. There can be no assurance that our revenue will not continue to decrease in future periods. We expect to continue incurring significant expenses related to research and development, sales and marketing efforts to commercialize our products, litigation and non-cash stock based compensation, and we expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our operating results. If our revenue grows more slowly than we anticipate, or if our operating expenses are above what we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenue, we may not become profitable on a sustained basis, or at all. If we do not attract and retain key employees, our business could be impaired. To be successful, we must attract and retain qualified scientific, engineering, manufacturing, sales, marketing and management personnel. To expand our research, product development and sales efforts we need additional people skilled in areas such as bioinformatics, organic chemistry, information services, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, sales, marketing and technical support. Competition for these people is intense, and our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. For example, our stock price has been volatile in recent years, resulting in a significant number of stock options granted to our employees having a strike price that is higher than the current trading price of our common stock. If we are unable to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we will not be able to expand our business or our business could be adversely affected. We also rely on our scientific advisors and consultants to assist us in formulating our research, development and commercialization strategy. All of these individuals are engaged by other employers and have commitments to other entities that may limit their availability to us. 22 Table of Contents Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business. A significant amount of our revenue is currently generated from sales outside the United States. Although such transactions are denominated in both U.S. dollars and foreign currencies, our future revenue, gross margin, expenses and financial condition are still affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including export and trade barriers and taxes; longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection. We also are subject to general geopolitical risks in connection with international operations, such as political, social and economic instability, potential hostilities, epidemics and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships. We cannot assure investors that one or more of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results or require us to modify our current business practices. Our effective tax rate may vary significantly. Our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the United States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. Estimates and judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. The ultimate amount of tax liability may be uncertain as a result. Changes in overall levels and the geographic mix of pretax earnings may adversely impact our effective tax rate. Certain jurisdictions have lower tax rates, and the amount of earnings in these jurisdictions may fluctuate. If we do not have profitable operations in these jurisdictions, our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted. Changes in tax laws, regulatory requirements, our treasury plans, and applicability of tax holidays and incentive programs in the countries in which we operate could have a material impact on our tax provision. Tax authorities may challenge the allocation of profits between our subsidiaries and conformance with requirements of tax holidays and incentive programs and we may not prevail in any such challenge. If we were not to prevail, we could be subject to higher tax rates or double tax. Estimates are required in determining any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Changes in the amount of valuation allowance required may significantly impact our financial results of operations. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions. During November 2011, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009 tax years and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or RAR, with no proposed adjustments. Failure in our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of customers or business opportunities. Information technology (“IT”) systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business, including sales forecast, order fulfillment and billing, customer service, logistics and management of data from running samples on our products. Our success depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems. IT systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite the security measures we have implemented, our IT systems may be subject to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. We also have taken precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems. Nevertheless, we may experience damages to our systems, and system failures and interruptions. If we experience systems problems, they may interrupt our ability to operate and adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and revenues. 23 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Investments Our strategic equity investments may result in losses. We periodically make strategic equity investments in various public and private companies with businesses or technologies that may complement our business. The market values of these strategic equity investments may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control. Other-than-temporary declines in the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in other companies have required us to record losses relative to our ownership interest. This could result in future charges to our earnings. It is uncertain whether or not we will realize any long-term benefits associated with these strategic investments. Global credit and financial market conditions could negatively impact the value of our current portfolio of cash equivalents or investments and our ability to meet our financing objectives. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. Our investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase. While as of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any downgrades, material losses, or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments since December 31, 2011, any significant deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets may negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents or investments or our ability to meet our financing objectives. Other-than-temporary declines in the market price and valuation of any of our investments would require us to adjust the carrying value of the investment through an impairment charge. Risks Related to Government Regulation and Litigation We and our customers are subject to various government regulations, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with, and experience delays in our product commercialization as a result of, these regulations. The Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has jurisdiction over the commercialization of medical devices, including in-vitro diagnostic test kits and the reagents and instrumentation used in these tests. In-vitro diagnostic tests, reagents, and instruments may be subject to pre-market review and post-market controls by the FDA. Certain in-vitro diagnostic products must also be approved by the regulatory agencies of foreign governments or jurisdictions before the product can be sold outside the United States. Commercialization of our and our collaborative partners’ in-vitro diagnostic products outside of the research environment may depend upon successful completion of clinical trials. Clinical development is a long, expensive and uncertain process and we do not know whether we, or any of our collaborative partners, will be permitted to undertake clinical trials of any potential in-vitro diagnostic products. It may take us or our collaborative partners many years to complete any such testing, and failure can occur at any stage. Delays or rejections of potential products may be encountered based on changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and regulatory agency review. Moreover, if and when our projects reach clinical trials, we, or our collaborative partners, may decide to discontinue development of any or all of these projects at any time for commercial, scientific or other reasons. Any of the foregoing matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Many of our products are labeled for “research use only”. Products intended for research use only are not subject to clearance or approval by the FDA. However, research use only products may fall under the FDA’s jurisdiction if these are used for clinical rather than research purposes. Even when a product is exempted from FDA clearance or approval, the FDA may impose restrictions as to the types of customers to which we can market and sell our products. Such restrictions may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 24 Table of Contents The FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and foreign government regulators are increasingly focused on genetic analysis tools, including the use of arrays, which are labeled for research use only, by clinical laboratories in laboratory-developed tests (“LDTs”) offered by these laboratories, including labs certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”). We cannot predict the extent of the FDA’s future efforts in regulation and enforcement policies with respect to the sale and use of arrays for the development of LDTs by CLIA-certified laboratories. If regulations or enforcement policies restrict our customers’ development of LDTs using our products labeled for research use only, or if we otherwise are required to obtain FDA premarket clearance or approval prior to commercializing these products, our ability to generate revenue from the sale of our products may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. Moreover, our failure to comply with governmental rules and regulations related to our products could cause us to incur significant adverse publicity, subject us to investigations and notices of non-compliance or lead to fines or restrictions upon our ability to sell our products. We also may be at risk for liability related to government reimbursement of tests involving the use of our products if it is determined that these tests require FDA-clearance or approval and no such clearance or approval has been obtained. Medical device laws and regulations are also in effect in many countries, ranging from comprehensive device approval requirements to requests for product data or certifications. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. We may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in such countries or may incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining our foreign regulatory approvals. In addition, the export by us of certain of our products which have not yet been cleared for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to FDA or other export restrictions. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. A failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts or administrative or other penalties, and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future government grants, contracts and programs. Healthcare reform and restrictions on reimbursements may limit our returns on molecular diagnostic products that we may develop with our collaborators. We are currently collaborating with our partners to develop diagnostic and therapeutic products. The ability of our collaborators to commercialize such products may depend, in part, on the extent to which reimbursement for these products will be available under U.S. and foreign regulations that govern reimbursement for clinical testing services by government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, third-party payer price resistance, the trend towards managed health care and the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 could reduce payment rates for health care products and services, adversely affecting the profits of our customers and collaborative partners and reducing our future royalties. Under Medicare rules, diagnostic tests must be ordered by a physician who is treating the beneficiary and who uses the test results in patient management. Under this rule, some Medicare contractors may deny coverage for a test, even if the test has been cleared or approved by the FDA, without proof, as determined sufficient by the contractor, that the test is useful in patient management. We face risks related to handling of hazardous materials and other regulations governing environmental safety. Our operations are subject to complex and stringent environmental, health, safety and other governmental laws and regulations that both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce. Our activities that are subject to these regulations include, among other things, our use of hazardous and radioactive materials and the generation, transportation and storage of waste. We could discover that we or an acquired business is not in material compliance. Existing laws and regulations may also be revised or reinterpreted, or new laws and regulations may become applicable to us, whether retroactively or prospectively, that may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. It is also impossible to eliminate completely the risk of accidental environmental contamination or injury to individuals. In such an event, we could be liable for any damages that result, which could adversely affect our business. We may be exposed to liability due to product defects. The risk of product liability claims is inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of human diagnostic and therapeutic products and we may be subjected to such claims. We may seek to acquire additional insurance for clinical or product liability risks. We may not be able to obtain such insurance or general product liability insurance on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts. A product liability claim or recall could have a serious adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 25 Table of Contents Ethical, legal and social concerns surrounding the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our products. Genetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information. For these reasons, governmental authorities may call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure. Similarly, such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible. Any of these scenarios could reduce the potential markets for our molecular diagnostic products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property We may be unable to effectively protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could harm our competitive position. Maintaining a strong patent position is critical to our business. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is uncertain, so we cannot be assured the patent rights we have or may obtain will be valuable. Others have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications that are similar or identical to ours or those of our licensors. To determine the priority of inventions, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office that could result in substantial costs in legal fees and could substantially affect the scope of our patent protection. We cannot be assured our patent applications will have priority over those filed by others. Also, our intellectual property may be subject to significant administrative and litigation proceedings such as opposition proceedings against our patents in Europe, Japan and other jurisdictions. Legal actions to enforce our patent rights can be expensive and may involve the diversion of significant management time. In addition, these legal actions could be unsuccessful and could also result in the invalidation of our patents or a finding that they are unenforceable. We may or may not choose to pursue litigation or interferences against those that have infringed on our patents, or used them without authorization, due to the associated expense and time commitment of monitoring these activities. If we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our results of operations. In addition to patent protection, we also rely upon copyright and trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and third-parties, to protect our confidential and proprietary information. Such measures may not provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Litigation or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products or services or impact our stock price. Third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. As we launch new products and enter new markets, we expect that competitors will claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of business strategies designed to impede our successful commercialization and entry into new markets. We are currently engaged in litigation with third parties who allege that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. See Note 12. “Legal Proceedings” to our Consolidated Financial Statements found elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. In addition, we are aware of third-party patents that may relate to our technology. We routinely receive notices claiming infringement from third parties as well as invitations to take licenses under third party patents. Third parties may have obtained, and may in the future obtain, patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents. 26 Table of Contents We could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims. Any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have a material adverse impact on our stock price, which may be disproportionate to the actual import of the ruling itself. Furthermore, parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief, which could block our ability to develop, commercialize and sell products, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from selling certain products. In addition, we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all. We could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties, which could negatively affect our gross margins. Moreover, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products, and the prohibition of sale of any of our products could materially affect our ability to grow and maintain profitability. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The market price of our common stock has been volatile. Our common stock traded as low as $3.68 and as high as $8.16 per share during the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2011. Our stock price may be affected by a number of factors, including those listed in these “Risk Factors” and other, unknown factors. Our stock price also may be affected by comments by securities analysts regarding our business or prospects, our issuance of common stock or other equity securities, our inability to meet analysts’ expectations, general fluctuations in the stock market or in the stock prices of our industry peers or our customers and general conditions and publicity regarding the genomics, biotechnology, pharmaceutical or life science industries. Volatility in the stock price of other companies often has led to securities class action litigation against those companies. Any future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources, which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our quarterly results have historically fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so. Failure to meet financial expectations may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price. Our revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly due in part to factors that are beyond our control and which we cannot predict. The timing of our customers’ orders may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, we have experienced customer ordering patterns for instrumentation and consumables in which the majority of the shipments occur in the last month of the quarter. These ordering patterns may limit management’s ability to accurately forecast our future revenue or product mix. Additionally, license revenue may also be unpredictable and may fluctuate due to the timing of payments of non-recurring licensing fees. Because our expenses are largely fixed in the short to medium term, any material shortfall in revenue may cause us to experience material losses. Because of this difficulty in predicting future performance, our operating results may fall below our own expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters. Our failure in the past to meet these expectations has adversely affected the market price of our common stock and may continue to do so. In addition to factors that affect the spending levels of our customers described above, additional factors could cause our operating results to fluctuate, including: · competition; · our inability to produce products in sufficient quantities and with appropriate quality; · the frequency of experiments conducted by our customers; · our customers’ inventory of products; · the receipt of relatively large orders with short lead times; and · our customers’ expectations as to how long it takes us to fill future orders. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.
