Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Business and IndustryWe benefit from Russia's tariffs and duties on imported steel, which may be eliminated in the future." Consolidation trends in the steel and mining industries The steel industry has experienced a consolidation trend in recent years, which continued throughout 2005 to 2007. Key consolidations during this period included Mittal Steel's acquisition of Arcelor in 2006 and the merger of Tata Steel and Corus in 2007 (which was itself the result of a merger between British Steel and Hoogovens in 2002). Recent and expected future consolidation in the steel industry should enable steel producers, and the industry generally, to maintain more consistent performance through cycles in the steel industry by achieving greater efficiency and economies of scale. We, along with other Russian steel producers, tend to focus on vertical integration rather than consolidation, which ensures access to a stable supply of raw materials, particularly coking coal and iron ore. Our vertical integration means that we are not as affected by tightening in the supply of raw materials and also provides us with the potential for upside gains on third-party sales by our mining business. The mining industry has also experienced a wave of consolidation. There are currently three primary iron ore suppliers in the international market, and if iron ore producer BHP Billiton is successful in its offer for Rio Tinto, there will only be two principal suppliers of iron ore in the international market. Suppliers of scrap are also consolidating, reflected by the Sims-Neu merger. Consolidation among suppliers in the mining industry has led to a stronger bargaining position among mining companies with steel producers. As we are vertically integrated in both the "upstream" and "downstream" sides of the mining and steel businesses, we are not as affected by consolidation among suppliers. Price trends for products Coking coal and steam coal Prices for coking coal decreased during the period 2005-2007. During this period, the contract price for standard hard coking coal peaked at $125 per tonne (FOB Australia) in April 2005 and fell to a low of $89 per tonne in April 2007, generally decreasing by 29% over the period, according to industry publications. The decrease in contract prices was due to a supply surplus which arose during 2006 but then diminished in the beginning of 2007 due to infrastructure constraints of major exporters, 116 particularly in Australia and, to a lesser extent, Canada, and bad weather affecting key coal-supplying countries. Prices for steam coal generally increased during the period 2005-2007, reaching a high of $130 per tonne (CIF ARA) in December 2007 and a low of $52 per tonne in November 2005, generally increasing by 84% over the period, according to industry publications. Prices increased due to global supply constraints and increases in freight rates. Iron ore Iron ore prices increased by 91% during the period 2005-2007, reaching a high price of $129 per tonne (64% Fe, China domestic prices, CPT) in December 2007 and a low price of $59 per tonne in January 2006, according to Metall-Expert. Prices increased generally due to buoyant demand and limited supply. Nickel Nickel prices generally increased during the period 2005-2007, increasing by 70%, according to London Metal Exchange ("LME") data. The cash price of nickel reached a high of $54,000 per tonne in May 2007 and a low of $11,500 per tonne in November 2005, according to the LME. The increase during this period was due primarily to a nickel deficit in the world market caused by speculative trading on the LME and a decrease in world nickel inventories. Steel During the period 2005-2007, steel prices increased by 88%, reaching a high price of $640 per tonne (rebar, Far East domestic) in December 2007 and a low price of $340 per tonne in January 2005, according to industry publications. The price increase during this period was due to a strong global demand and limited supply to international markets, particularly due to Chinese export restrictions. Freight costs The global steel and mining industries are affected by changes in ocean freight charges. Recent trends have been towards increased volatility and higher ocean freight charges due to worldwide capacity issues and localized logistical bottlenecks. During the period 2005-2007, freight rates peaked at $61.00 per tonne (Queensland to Rotterdam, Capesize vessels) in November 2007 and fell to a low of $14.60 per tonne in August 2007, according to industry publications. Freight costs are a significant concern for Russian steel producers and mining companies, as distances in Russia are large and major steel producing and mining areas tend to be located far from developed year-round port facilities. In addition to geographical challenges, domestic Russian rail freight shipments are carried out by a government-controlled monopoly, Russian Railways, such that there is no downward pressure on rail freight rates due to market competition, unlike in countries where there are multiple freight carriers that compete based on price. Exchange rates The fall in the value of the dollar versus many other world currencies, a trend which started in 2006 and accelerated in 2007 and early 2008, has resulted in increased prices in dollar terms of coking and steam coal, iron ore, nickel and steel products. The dollar continued to weaken against currencies of the jurisdictions in which we have operations, including the Russian ruble, the Romanian lei, the Lithuanian litas, the Bulgarian lev and the Kazakhstan tenge. In the first quarter of 2008, the dollar reached historical lows against the euro and other major world currencies. 117 Our products are typically priced in rubles for Russian and CIS sales and in U.S. dollars or euros for international sales, and our direct costs, including raw materials, labor and transportation costs, are largely incurred in rubles, while other costs, such as interest expense, are incurred in rubles, euro and U.S. dollars. The mix of our revenues and costs is such that appreciation in real terms of the ruble against the U.S. dollar tends to result in an increase in our costs relative to our revenues, while depreciation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar in real terms tends to result in a decrease in our costs relative to our revenues. When the ruble appreciates in real terms against the U.S. dollar, this means that our sales prices in dollar terms must increase in order to offset the effects of both cost inflation and translation differences in our U.S. GAAP financial statements. During the period under review, the ruble has steadily appreciated in real terms against the U.S. dollar, but this real appreciation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar has been more than offset by increased prices for our steel products, both in Russia and internationally. In addition, any nominal depreciation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar generally results in a decrease in the reported U.S. dollar value of our ruble-denominated assets (and liabilities), while nominal appreciation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar results in an increase in the reported U.S. dollar value of our ruble-denominated assets (and liabilities). Moreover, nominal appreciation and depreciation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar has a similar effect when the income statements of our Russian subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Primarily as a result of ruble appreciation, the translation gain in our U.S. GAAP financial statements decreased by $26.6 million, or 18%, to $122.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $148.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. Acquisitions Across our segments, when market conditions are favorable, acquisitions generally lead to higher consolidated revenues due to higher production and sales volumes due to the consolidation of the newly acquired entities. Organic growth in revenues across our segments is driven largely by price increases and changes in the product mix towards higher-value-added products, as well as sales volume increases as a result of increases in steel production and coal and nickel mining volumes. Our acquisitions in 2007 contributed to the consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2007 as follows: The total contribution of the companies we acquired in 2007 to our consolidated revenues was $611 million, including $135 million in respect of Yakutugol, $447 million in respect of Southern Kuzbass Power Plant and Southern Kuzbass Power Sales Company and $29 million in respect of Bratsk Ferroalloys Plant. The Yakutugol and Elgaugol acquisitions resulted in additional coal reserves of 244.0 million tonnes and additional coal deposits of 521.1 million tonnes as of January 1, 2008 compared with our coal reserves and deposits as of January 1, 2007. Expanding our coal reserves and deposits through acquisitions is part of our strategy to remain a world-class coal producer by volume for years to come. Our acquisitions enhance the vertical integration of our group and contribute to the growth of our business segments. At the same time, we also continue to devote resources to further our organic growth, such as the implementation of cost-cutting strategies in our steel and mining segments and the expansion of our product mix in the steel segment to encompass more high-value-added products. 118 Results of Operations The following table sets forth our income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues Amount % of revenues Amount % of revenues Amount % of revenues (in millions of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Revenue, net 6,683,842 100.0 % 4,397,811 100.0 % 3,804,995 100.0 % Cost of goods sold (4,166,864 ) (62.3 )% (2,860,224 ) (65.0 )% (2,469,134 ) (64.9 )% Gross profit 2,516,978 37.7 % 1,537,587 35.0 % 1,335,861 35.1 % Selling, distribution and operating expenses (1,119,385 ) (16.7 )% (811,889 ) (18.5 )% (820,133 ) (21.6 )% Operating income 1,397,593 20.9 % 725,698 16.5 % 515,728 13.5 % Other income and (expense), net (12,146 ) (0.2 )% 139,135 3.2 % 10,131 0.3 % Income before income tax, minority interest and discontinued operations 1,385,447 20.7 % 864,833 19.7 % 525,859 13.8 % Income tax expense (356,320 ) (5.3 )% (230,599 ) (5.2 )% (136,643 ) (3.6 )% Minority interest in loss (income) of subsidiaries (116,234 ) (1.7 )% (31,528 ) (0.7 )% (6,879 ) (0.2 )% Income from continuing operations 912,893 13.7 % 602,706 13.7 % 382,337 10.0 % Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 158 0.0 % 543 0.0 % (1,157 ) 0.0 % Net income 913,051 13.7 % 603,249 13.7 % 381,180 10.0 % Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to year ended December 31, 2006 Revenues Consolidated revenues increased by $2,286.0 million, or 52.0%, to $6,683.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2007, from $4,397.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. Across our segments, our acquisitions in 2006 and 2007 led to higher consolidated revenues due to higher production and sales volumes arising primarily from the consolidation of the results of operations of acquired companies. Approximately 27%, or $611.0 million, of the increase in our consolidated revenues in the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 was due to the consolidation of companies acquired during the year. The remainder of our increase in revenues was due to organic growth, which was driven largely by price increases and changes in the product mix towards higher-value-added products. In addition, the steady decrease in real terms of the value of the dollar, in which most of our products are priced, against the ruble, in which most of our production costs are incurred, put exchange rate-based pressure on profit margins, which was more than offset by increases in the weighted average prices of products sold by our mining and steel segments. 119 The following table sets forth our revenues by segment: Year ended December 31, Revenues by segment 2007 2006 (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except percentages) Mining segment To third parties 1,844,758 1,305,555 To power segment 11,272 399 To steel segment 700,965 376,569 Total 2,556,995 1,682,523 Steel segment To third parties 4,335,768 3,042,793 To power segment 22,509 17,195 To mining segment 84,923 23,664 Total 4,443,200 3,083,652 Power segment To third parties 503,316 49,463 To steel segment 38,587 41,087 To mining segment 56,612 32,772 Total 598,515 123,322 Eliminations 914,868 491,686 Consolidated revenues 6,683,842 4,397,811 % from mining segment 27.6 % 29.7 % % from steel segment 64.9 % 69.2 % % from power segment 7.5 % 1.1 % Mining segment Our total mining segment sales increased by $874.5 million, or 52.0%, to $2,557.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $1,682.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. Coking coal concentrate sales to third parties increased by $104.6 million, or 20.2%, to $622.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $518.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, where a decrease in sales volumes offset a $150.4 million sales price increase by $45.9 million. The price increases occurred on both export and domestic markets, resulting from increasing coking coal demand and tight supply both in domestic and export markets due to accidents in several Russian coal mines which caused mine closures and cargo seaport capacity problems in Australia. The volume of coking coal concentrate sold to third parties decreased by 584 thousand tonnes, or 8.8%, to 6,018 thousand tonnes in the year ended December 31, 2007 from 6,603 thousand tonnes in the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to an increase in intersegment sales volumes as described below. Coking coal concentrate supplied to the steel segment increased by $220.3 million, or 117.5%, to $407.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $187.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, where $123.7 million of the increase was due to an increase in sales prices and $96.6 million was due to an increase in sales volumes. The increase in volumes was principally due to shipments from Southern Kuzbass Coal Company to Moscow Coke and Gas Plant of 981 thousand tonnes that were insignificant in 2006 before our acquisition of Moscow Coke and Gas Plant, as we 120 acquired Moscow Coke and Gas Plant in the fourth quarter of 2006, and shipments from Yakutugol to Mechel-Coke and Moscow Coke and Gas Plant in the fourth quarter 2007 totaling 58 thousand tonnes. Steam coal and steam coal concentrate sales to third parties increased by $125.2 million, or 40.2%, to $436.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $311.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, where $102.0 million of the increase was due to an increase in sales prices and $23.2 million was due to an increase in sales volume. The increase of sales volumes during the period was principally due to the fact that the results of operations of Yakutugol were reflected in our consolidated results of operations from the fourth quarter of 2007. If Yakutugol's results of operations are excluded, our steam coal volumes sold in 2007 would have decreased by 3%, in part due to the increase in the volume of steam coal supplied to the power segment and in part due to a shortage, as compared to the prior period, of working, empty rail freight cars from Russian Railways in the Southern Kuzbass region where our other coal operations are based. Export prices for steam coal and steam coal concentrate rose during the period as a result of increasing demand, especially in Asia, and limited supply growth from major exporting countries. Domestic prices rose on the back of growing production costs and global steam coal price increases. Steam coal supplied to the power segment increased by $9.8 million, or 100%, to $9.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from none in the year ended December 31, 2006, due to the acquisition of Southern Kuzbass Power Plant. Sales of iron ore to third parties increased by $45.4 million, or 27.0%, to $213.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $168.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, where a decrease in sales volumes offset a $76.1 million sales price increase by $30.7 million. Price increases were driven principally by increasing iron ore demand in Russia and elsewhere, especially in China; limited iron ore production capacity increases which typically lag behind rising demand; and significant increases in freight costs. The decrease in sales volumes is primarily attributable to a temporary decrease in the second half of 2007 in orders from ZapSib, one of our primary customers, which sourced its iron ore from a different supplier during part of 2007. Supplies to the steel segment increased by $57.6 million, or 60.3%, to $153.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $95.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to a sales price increase, as there was no significant increase in volumes. Nickel sales to third parties increased by $210.2 million, or 81.3%, to $468.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $258.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, where $189.6 million of the increase was due to an increase in sales prices and $20.6 million of the increase was due to an increase in sales volumes. Average sales prices increased by $14,468 to $35,775 per tonne during the course of 2007. LME prices increased to record levels in the first half of 2007. The highest daily spot price reached $54,200 per tonne on May 16, 2007. Sales volumes increased by 8% to 13 thousand tonnes in the year ended December 31, 2007 from 12 thousand tonnes in the year ended December 31, 2006 due to the overall increase of production volumes at Southern Urals Nickel Plant. Nickel supplies to the steel segment increased by $46.5 million, or 58.6%, to $125.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $79.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, due to an increase in sales prices. There were no significant changes in intersegment sales volumes. Excluding intersegment sales, export sales were 55.4% of mining segment sales in the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 49.7% in the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in the proportion of our export sales was due to the higher export volumes of steam coal, nickel and iron ore due to higher sales prices on export markets. The average steam coal export price on a Free Carrier (FCA) basis in 2007 was $44.4 per tonne in comparison with $32.3 per tonne for the average domestic price on an FCA basis in 2006; the average iron ore export sales price on an FCA basis in 2007 was $84.9 per tonne in comparison with $73.5 per tonne for the average domestic price on an FCA basis in 2006. 121 Steel segment Our steel segment revenues increased by $1,359.5 million, or 44.1%, to $4,443.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $3,083.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in steel segment revenues was primarily due to the following increases: Coke and coking products sales increased by $235.8 million, or 542.8%, to $284.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $49.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, where $61.2 million of the increase was due to an increase in sales prices and $174.6 million of the increase was due to an increase in sales volumes. The sales volume increase was a result of consolidating Moscow Coke and Gas Plant results for the full year 2007; in 2006, the results for the plant were consolidated for the fourth quarter only. The sales prices increase was due to strong market demand for coke and coking products. Ferrosilicon sales increased by $29.0 million, or 100%, to $29.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from none in the year ended December 31, 2006, due to the acquisition of Bratsk Ferroalloy Plant in August 2007. Semi-finished steel products sales increased by $157.6 million, or 39.6%, to $555.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $397.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, where $115.0 million of the increase was due to an increase in sales prices and $42.6 million of the increase was due to an increase in sales volumes. Increases in both sales prices and sales volumes were primarily driven by increased demand and a shortage in supply from China. Alloyed long products sales increased by $20.8 million, or 15.8%, to $151.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $131.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, where a decrease in sales volumes offset a $40.9 million sales price increase by $20.1 million. The sales price increase was primarily driven by a significant increase in alloy materials' costs. The sales volume decrease was caused by a decrease in market demand for alloyed long products following an increase in market prices for such products. Rebar sales increased by $264.1 million, or 35.1%, to $1,017.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $753.0 in the year ended December 31, 2006, where $228.4 million of the increase was due to an increase in sales prices and $35.7 million of the increase was due to an increase in sales volumes. The increases in both sales prices and sales volumes are attributable to the high level of activity in the construction industry in Russia. Low alloyed engineering steel sales increased by $111.6 million, or 35.5%, to $426.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $314.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, where $97.8 million of the increase was due to an increase in sales prices and $13.8 million of the increase was due to an increase in sales volumes. The increases in both sales prices and sales volumes were driven by strong demand on both export and domestic markets. Flat steel products sales increased by $117.7 million, or 38.7%, to $421.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $304.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, where $112.8 million of the increase was due to an increase in sales prices and $4.8 million of the increase was due to an increase in sales volumes. The increase in sales prices was in both domestic and export markets, and was mainly due to a stainless flat steel price increase driven by an increase in nickel prices in 2007. The other reasons were a general increase in production costs and strong domestic demand. Forgings and stampings sales increased by $133.1 million, or 57.2%, to $366.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $232.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, where a decrease in sales volumes offset a $126.1 million sales price increase by $7.1 million. The increase in the sales price was primarily due to rapid increases in the market prices for nickel 122 and other alloy materials and a shift in product mix to more value-added items. The sales volume decrease is explained mainly by increased competition in the market due to new entrants to the market and a resulting decrease in orders from our customers. Hardware sales increased by $145.4 million, or 31.7%, to $603.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $458.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, where $78.6 million of the increase was due to an increase in sales prices and $66.8 million of the increase was due to an increase in sales volumes. The volume increase was due to the installation of several new production lines at the Beloretsk Metallurgical Plant, including two spring wire drawing mills and a stabilized high-tensile wire production complex. The price increase was due to an increase in demand on the Russian domestic market and in the CIS from the construction industry, machine-building and other industries. Excluding intersegment sales, export sales comprised 31.4% of steel segment sales in the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 32.5% in the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in the proportion of our export sales was largely due to favorable domestic pricing and robust domestic steel consumption growth which exceeded the Russian steel industry's increase in production volumes. Power segment Our power segment revenues increased almost four-fold by $475.2 million to $598.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $123.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in power segment revenues was principally due to the acquisition of Southern Kuzbass Power Plant and Southern Kuzbass Power Sales Company in the second quarter of 2007, which resulted in an almost four-fold increase in segment revenues from sales to third parties of $446.7 million. Prior to our acquisition of Southern Kuzbass Power Plant and Southern Kuzbass Power Sales Company in the second quarter of 2007, our power segment consisted of intersegment and third-party sales of electricity produced by co-generation units burning blast furnace gas and coal gas produced as a byproduct of industrial processes at our Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant, Moscow Coke and Gas Plant, Southern Kuzbass Coal Company and Mechel-Coke. Southern Kuzbass Power Plant contributed $1.8 million to the power segment revenues through power generation capacity sales to third parties in the second half of 2007. Cost of goods sold and gross margin Consolidated cost of goods sold was 62.3% of consolidated revenues in the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 65.0% of consolidated revenues in the year ended December 31, 2006, resulting in an increase in consolidated gross margin to 37.7% in the year ended December 31, 2007 from 35.0% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Cost of goods sold primarily consists of costs relating to raw materials (including products purchased for resale), direct payroll, depreciation and energy. The table below sets forth cost of goods sold and gross margin by segment for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, including as a percentage of segment revenues. 123 Year ended December 31, 2007 Year ended December 31, 2006 Cost of goods sold and gross margin by segment Amount % of segment revenues Amount % of segment revenues (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Mining segment Cost of goods sold 1,241,665 48.6 % 1,008,806 60.0 % Gross margin 1,315,330 51.4 % 673,717 40.0 % Steel segment Cost of goods sold 3,387,007 76.2 % 2,224,366 72.1 % Gross margin 1,056,193 23.8 % 859,286 27.9 % Power segment Cost of goods sold 393,153 65.7 % 110,273 89.4 % Gross margin 205,362 34.3 % 13,049 10.6 % Mining segment Mining segment cost of goods sold increased by $232.9 million, or 23.1%, to $1,241.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $1,008.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. Mining segment gross margin increased from 40.0% in the year ended December 31, 2006 to 51.4% in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the mining segment gross margin was principally due to (1) the increase in coking coal and iron ore sales prices in both export and domestic markets, (2) an increase in nickel and steam coal sales prices in export markets and (3) a decrease in the production cash costs of coking coal concentrate at Southern Kuzbass Coal Company by 3.0% due to an increase in production volumes and a corresponding apportionment of fixed costs to larger production volumes. The production cash costs of steam coal and steam coal concentrate remained flat, and cash costs of production of nickel and iron ore increased by 24.5% and 38.9%, respectively, due to an increase in electricity prices, production personnel wages and the prices of mining supplies used in coal and iron ore production, such as spare parts and equipment, fuel and explosives, as well as the prices of raw materials used in nickel production such as coke, pyrites and limestone. Steel segment Steel segment cost of goods sold increased by $1,162.6 million, or 52.3%, to $3,387.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $2,224.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. Steel segment cost of goods sold was 76.2% of the segment's revenues in the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 72.1% in the year ended December 31, 2006, resulting in a decrease in gross margin from 27.9% to 23.8%. Such decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in production costs during the period under review, which was itself due to the growth in raw materials prices, particularly the prices of nickel and coking coal. Power segment Power segment cost of goods sold increased by $282.9 million, or 256.5%, to $393.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $110.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. Power segment gross margin increased from 10.6% in the year ended December 31, 2006, to 34.3% in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the power segment gross margin principally reflected the acquisition of Southern Kuzbass Power Plant and Southern Kuzbass Power Sales Company in the second quarter of 2007, which generated higher profits than previously existing co-generation assets at our production facilities. The new assets also have incurred high electricity transmission costs that are included in the selling and distribution expenses for the power segment, as set forth below. 124 Selling, distribution and operating expenses Selling, distribution and operating expenses increased by $307.5 million, or 37.9%, to $1,119.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $811.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, selling, distribution and operating expenses decreased to 16.7% in the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 18.5% in the year ended December 31, 2006. Our selling, distribution and operating expenses consist primarily of selling and distribution expenses, taxes other than income tax, loss on write-offs of property, plant and equipment, provision for doubtful accounts and general, administrative and other operating expenses. The table below sets forth these costs by segment for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, including as a percentage of segment revenues. Year ended December 31, 2007 Year ended December 31, 2006 Selling, distribution and operating expenses by segment Amount % of segment revenues Amount % of segment revenues (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Mining segment Selling and distribution expenses 249,200 9.7 % 216,760 12.9 % Taxes other than income tax 10,964 0.4 % 37,311 2.2 % Loss on write off of property, plant and equipment     Accretion expense 1,392 0.1 % 2,344 0.1 % Provision for doubtful accounts (1,428 ) (0.1 )% (29 ) 0.0 % General, administrative and other operating expenses 168,503 6.6 % 98,284 5.8 % Total 428,631 16.7 % 354,670 21.0 % Steel segment Selling and distribution expenses 190,144 4.3 % 199,871 6.5 % Taxes other than income tax 71,622 1.6 % 44,536 1.4 % Loss on write off of property, plant and equipment   2,418 0.1 % Accretion expense 1,708 0.0 % 5,089 0.2 % Provision for doubtful accounts 3,591 0.1 % 2,767 0.1 % General, administrative and other operating expenses 230,953 5.2 % 198,139 6.4 % Total 498,018 11.2 % 452,820 14.7 % Power segment Selling and distribution expenses 182,466 30.5 % 2,270 1.8 % Taxes other than income tax 1,409 0.2 % 292 0.2 % Loss on write off of property, plant and equipment     Accretion expense     Provision for doubtful accounts (752 ) (0.1 )% (16 ) 0.0 % General, administrative and other operating expenses 9,612 1.6 % 1,853 1.5 % Total 192,735 32.2 % 4,399 3.5 % Mining segment Selling and distribution expenses consisted almost entirely of transportation expenses related to our selling activities, and increased by $32.4 million in line with sales volume increases in 2007. As a percentage of mining segment revenues, selling and distribution expenses decreased from 12.9% to 9.7% due to an increase in the share of sales on terms other than FCA, where transportation expenses are paid by the customer. 125 Taxes other than income tax include property and land taxes, as well as other taxes. Taxes other than income tax decreased by $26.3 million, or 70.6%, to $11.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $37.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was mainly due to the recognition of a $25.7 million tax asset related to Korshunov Mining Plant in respect of the overpayment of mineral extraction taxes and social taxes for prior periods. On December 18, 2007, the Supreme Arbitration Court of the Russian Federation issued an order in our favor that clarified an aspect of tax law that was previously uncertain, resulting in a reduction in our mineral extraction tax liability for the years 2003-2007. Following the court decision, the tax authorities have been ordered to refund our overpayment of these taxes for prior periods and the accounting provisions previously made in respect of such tax liabilities have been reversed. In addition, on April 7, 2008, the Federal Arbitration Court in Moscow issued an order in our favor requiring the tax authorities to pay interest to us in respect of overpaid social taxes previously assessed for the period from August 2004 to February 2007. Provision for doubtful accounts decreased by $1.4 million, or 479.6%, to $1.4 million income in the year ended December 31, 2007 from income of $29.2 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2006, due to an improvement in our collection of trade receivables. General, administrative and other expenses increased by $70.2 million, or 71.4%, to $168.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $98.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, representing an increase as a percentage of segment revenues from 5.8% to 6.6%. Salaries and related social taxes increased by $35.9 million, or 69.4%, to $87.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $51.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, mainly due to indexation of salary rates to inflation at our production companies, increases in management bonuses and an increase in headcount in connection with the Yakutugol acquisition which accounted for additional salaries and related social taxes of $11.0 million. Legal and consulting fees and insurance services increased by $2.7 million, or 28.0%, to $12.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $9.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, due to increases in consulting fees. Rent and maintenance, business travel expenses, bank charges and office expenses increased by $7.3 million, or 57.9%, to $20.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $12.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, and depreciation increased by $2.6 million, or 80.8%, to $5.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, due to the overall expansion of segment activities in 2007. Social expenses increased by $15.5 million, or 114.3%, to $29.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $13.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, mainly due to expansion of our socially-oriented activities in various regions of Russia as well as social programs for our employees. Other administrative and operating expenses increased by $6.1 million due to overall expansion of segment activities. Steel segment Selling and distribution expenses for our steel segment consisted almost entirely of transportation expenses related to our selling activities. Such expenses decreased by $9.7 million, or 4.9%, to $190.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $199.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease is explained by an increase in the share of export sales represented by deliveries on Free On Board (FOB) and Carriage Paid To (CPT) terms in the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, which resulted in a decrease in the freight cost per tonne of products sold. Taxes other than income tax increased by $27.1 million, or 60.8%, to $71.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $44.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. As a percentage of segment revenues, these taxes increased from 1.4% to 1.6%. Property and land taxes increased by $9.5 million, or 26.8%, to $45.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $35.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, due to an increase in the property tax base (as a result of putting into 126 operation new fixed assets). At the same time, in the year ended December 31, 2007 we incurred $10.1 million in tax penalties and fines as a result of prior-period tax audits at our Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant. The remaining increase of $7.5 million was caused mainly by the increase of non-reimbursable VAT expenses at Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant. The majority of these expenses are related to non-reimbursable VAT on railway charges that increased in line with the increase in rail freight carriage prices. Provision for doubtful accounts increased by $0.8 million, or 29.8%, to $3.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $2.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, due to changes in our estimate of bad debts as of the respective period end dates based on the ageing of the balances. General, administrative and other expenses, which consisted of payroll and payroll taxes, depreciation, rent and maintenance, legal and consulting expenses, office overhead and other expenses, increased by $32.8 million, or 16.6%, to $231.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $198.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, and decreased as a percentage of segment revenues from 6.4% in the year ended December 31, 2006, to 5.2% in the year ended December 31, 2007. Payroll and related social taxes increased by $29.2 million, or 35.6%, to $111.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $82.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, mainly due to indexation of salary rates to inflation at our production companies and also due to increases in management bonuses. Social expenses (including pension obligations) increased by $3.7 million, or 19.2%, to $23.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $19.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, due to expansion of our social activities in various regions of Russia as well as social programs for our employees. Rent and maintenance, business travel expenses, bank charges and office expenses increased by $7.5 million, or 32.7%, to $35.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $23.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to the overall expansion of segment activities in 2007. Professional expenses, which include auditing, accounting, legal and engineering fees, and insurance services increased by $2.7 million, or 16.9%, to $18.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $15.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, due to increases in consulting fees. Other administrative expenses increased by $8.7 million, or 68.4%, to $21.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $12.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, mainly due to an increase in the number of administrative departments at our Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant. These decreases were partially offset by recognition of income from reductions in asset retirement obligations at our Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant of $19.7 million based on expert consultants' review of our capital expenditure program for Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant and planned changes aimed at minimizing environmental impact. Power segment Selling and distribution expenses consisted almost entirely of electricity transmission costs incurred by our Southern Kuzbass Power Sales Company for usage of the power grid, over which electricity is distributed to end consumers. These costs are incurred by all power distribution companies under agreements between such companies and the grid operator. These expenses increased by $180.2 million, to $182.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, due to the acquisition of new business assetsSouthern Kuzbass Power Plant and Southern Kuzbass Power Sales Companyin the second quarter of 2007. The increase of all other expenses in this segment were due to the acquisition of new assets. Operating income As a result of the factors described above, operating income increased by $671.9 million, or 92.6%, to $1,397.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $725.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income as a percentage of consolidated revenues increased from 16.5% in the year ended December 31, 2006 to 21.0% in the year ended December 31, 2007, due primarily to 127 an increase in gross margin as a result of more favorable market conditions for the steel and mining segments. The table below sets out operating income by segment, including as a percentage of segment revenues. Year ended December 31, 2007 Year ended December 31, 2006 Operating income by segment Amount % of segment revenues Amount % of segment revenues (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Mining segment 886,698 34.7 % 319,048 19.0 % Steel segment 558,174 12.6 % 406,466 13.2 % Power segment 12,627 2.1 % 8,649 7.0 % Elimination of intersegment unrealized profit (59,906 ) (8,465 ) Consolidated operating income 1,397,593 725,698 Other income and expense, net Other income and expense, net consists of income (loss) of equity investees, interest income, interest expense, gain on revaluation of trading securities, other income and foreign exchange gain. The table below sets forth these costs for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, including as a percentage of revenues. Year ended December 31, 2007 Year ended December 31, 2006 Other income and expense, net Amount % of segment revenues Amount % of segment revenues (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Income (loss) from equity investees 8 0.0 % (9,858 ) (0.2 )% Interest income 12,278 0.2 % 8,314 0.2 % Interest expense (98,976 ) (1.5 )% (38,183 ) (0.9 )% Gain on revaluation of trading securities   50,688 1.2 % Other income, net 19,844 0.3 % 69,401 1.6 % Foreign exchange gain (loss) 54,700 0.8 % 58,773 1.3 % Total (12,146 ) (0.2 )% 139,135 3.2 % Income from equity investees for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $6.1 million from our share in income of our equity investees (excluding Yakutugol) offset by our share in Yakutugol losses of $6.1 million for the period from January 1, 2007 to October 19, 2007, a net effect of $8 thousand. We started to consolidate the results of operations of Yakutugol fully from October 19, 2007 after our acquisition of control of Yakutugol. The increase in equity investee income by $9.9 million, or 100.1%, to $8 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2007 from a loss of $9.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, was mainly due to the improvement in Yakutugol's performance due to the more favorable situation on both Russian and international coal markets. Interest income increased by $4.0 million, or 47.7%, to $12.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $8.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was principally due to higher average cash balances held in short-term deposits with financial institutions during 2007 by our Russian subsidiaries. Interest expense increased by $60.8 million, or 159.2%, to $99.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $38.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was 128 principally due to higher average loan balances of our companies in 2007, particularly in respect of working capital loans extended to our production and trading companies. In the year ended December 31, 2007 we recorded other income of $19.8 million, primarily consisting of gain due to the release of an accounting provision in respect of a $10.7 million tax liability relating to our Korshunov Mining Plant due to our successful challenge of a tax assessment relating to mineral extraction tax, income from release of prior-period tax provisions for Mechel International Holdings AG of $9.3 million, income on other sales of $10.7 million and gain on forgiveness of taxes at Southern Kuzbass Coal Company and Mechel Campia Turzii of $8.3 million, partially offset by the loss on sales of investments by Moscow Coke and Gas Plant of $13.4 million. In the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded other income of $69.4 million, primarily consisting of gains related to the forgiveness of tax liabilities (including fines and penalties) in our Russian and Romanian subsidiaries of $69.8 million ($44.6 million in Mechel Targoviste, $9.0 million in Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant, $5.9 million in Beloretsk Metallurgical Plant and $5.8 million in Southern Urals Nickel Plant). Gain (loss) on revaluation of trading securities arose from the revaluation of investments held by Moscow Coke and Gas Plant. These were investments in shares of leading Russian banks and oil and gas companies, which are traded on various Russian exchanges. The investments were sold in the second quarter of 2007 in accordance with our plans to divest non-core activities. Foreign exchange gain decreased by $4.1 million, or 6.9%, to $54.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $58.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. This foreign exchange gain was primarily attributable to gains from the downward revaluation of U.S. dollar-denominated liabilities of our Russian subsidiaries. Income tax expense Income tax expense increased by $125.7 million, or 54.5%, to $356.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $230.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, while our effective tax rate in 2007 decreased to 25.7% from 26.7% in 2006. The increase in the absolute figure of income tax expenses was due to the increase in taxable income of our Russian subsidiaries in 2007. Minority interest Minority interest in income of subsidiaries increased by $84.7 million, or 268.7%, to $116.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $31.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. The minority interest in the income of our subsidiaries in 2007 consisted primarily of the share of minority shareholders in the net income of Southern Urals Nickel Plant of $52.4 million, our coal companies of $19.2 million, Korshunov Mining Plant of $22.2 million and Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant of $12.3 million, and various steel segment companies of $10.1 million. Income from continuing operations Income from continuing operations increased by $310.2 million, or 51.5%, to $912.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $602.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, as a result of the factors explained above. Income from discontinued operations Income from discontinued operations decreased by $0.4 million, or 71.0%, to $0.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. In both periods, income from discontinued operations was attributable to Mechel Zeljezara, a Mechel subsidiary which terminated production in August 2004. The winding-up of Mechel Zeljezara was completed in February 2008. Income in 2007 resulted from a write-off of Mechel Zeljezara's accounts payable as a result of its liquidation. Income in 2006 resulted from a reversal of a provision for bad debts of Mechel Zeljezara recorded in prior periods due to the settlement of such debts. 129 Net income For the reasons set forth above, our net income increased in the year ended December 31, 2007 by $309.8 million, or 51.4%, to $913.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $603.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. Year ended December 31, 2006 compared to year ended December 31, 2005 Revenues Consolidated revenues increased by $592.8 million, or 15.6%, to $4,397.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $3,805.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. The following table sets out revenues by segment. Year ended December 31, Revenues by segment 2006 2005 (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except percentages) Mining segment To third parties 1,305,555 1,090,181 To power segment 399 398 To steel segment 376,569 336,593 Total 1,682,523 1,427,172 Steel segment To third parties 3,042,793 2,710,211 To power segment 17,195 184 To mining segment 23,664 56,633 Total 3,083,652 2,767,028 Power segment To third parties 49,463 4,603 To power segment 41,087 2,059 To mining segment 32,772 17,870 Total 123,322 24,532 Eliminations 491,686 413,737 Consolidated revenues 4,397,811 3,804,995 % from mining segment 29.7 % 28.7 % % from steel segment 69.2 % 71.2 % % from power segment 1.1 % 0.1 % Mining segment Our total mining segment sales in the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by $255.4 million, or 17.9%, to $1,682.5 million from $1,427.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. Coking coal concentrate sales to third parties increased by $55.3 million, or 12.0%, to $518.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $463.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to volume increases, partially offset by sales price decreases in both the domestic and export markets. Coking coal concentrate supplied to the steel segment decreased by $29.6 million, or 13.6%, to $187.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $217.2 million in 130 the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily as a result of decrease in the volume supplied to our Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant. Steam coal and steam coal concentrate sales to third parties increased by $37.6 million, or 13.8%, to $311.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $273.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to volume increases partially offset by sales price decreases in both the domestic and export markets. Sales of iron ore to third parties increased insignificantly by $1.1 million, or 0.7%, to $168.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $167.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, and supplies to the steel segment increased by $5.8 million, or 6.5%, to $95.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $89.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to volume increases. Nickel sales to third parties increased by $108.2 million, or 71.9%, to $258.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $150.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to price increases. Nickel supplies to the steel segment increased by $57.1 million, or 258.0%, to $79.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $22.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, due to price increases as well as an increase of sales volumes supplied to our steel production plants, Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant, Izhstal and Mechel Targoviste. Excluding intersegment sales, export sales were 48.6% of mining segment sales in the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 55.7% in the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease in the proportion of our export sales was due to the higher domestic volumes generated by increased demand from domestic steelmakers and lower export volumes. The decreased export volumes were due to the significantly lower weighted average export prices (on an FCA basis) for coal and iron ore in 2006 as compared to the weighted average sales prices on the domestic market ($35.1 per tonne in comparison to $53.9 per tonne). Steel segment Our steel segment revenues increased by $316.6 million, or 11.4%, to $3,083.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $2,767.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in steel segment revenues was primarily due to the following increases: Rebar sales increased by $136.2 million, or 22.1%, to $753.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $616.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, mainly due to price increases on the domestic market linked to the expansion of construction market. Stainless flat products sales increased by $79.3 million, or 172.8%, to $125.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $45.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, mainly due to sales volume increases linked to the expectation that import duties on flat products would be introduced on the Russian market (which duties were ultimately imposed in 2007). Hardware sales increased by $84.2 million, or 22.5%, to $458.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $373.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily as a result of price increases on the domestic market and a change in our product mix to include an increased share of high valued added products. Stampings sales increased by $29.9 million, or 24.6%, to $151.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $121.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily as a result of price increases on the domestic market. Excluding intersegment sales, export sales comprised 32.3% of steel segment sales in the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 44.7% in the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease in the proportion of our export sales was largely due to a decrease in export sales volumes in 2006 131 compared to 2005. The decreased export volumes were primarily due to the more favorable prices on the domestic market, as described above. Power segment Our total power segment sales increased by $98.8 million, or 402.7%, to $123.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $24.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in both segment sales to third parties and intersegment sales is explained by the development of Mechel-Energo, which in 2006 started to make third-party sales of power produced by our subsidiaries' co-generation facilities and sales of power and gas purchased from third parties to our production subsidiaries. Cost of goods sold and gross margin Consolidated cost of goods sold was 65.0% of consolidated revenues in the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 64.9% of consolidated revenues in the year ended December 31, 2005, resulting in a decrease in the consolidated gross margin percentage in the year ended December 31, 2006 to 35.0% from 35.1% in the year ended December 31, 2005. Cost of goods sold primarily consists of costs relating to raw materials (including products purchased for resale), direct payroll, depreciation and energy. The table below sets forth cost of goods sold and gross margin by segment for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, including as a percentage of segment revenues. Year ended December 31, 2006 Year ended December 31, 2005 Cost of goods sold and gross margin by segment Amount % of segment revenues Amount % of segment revenues (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Mining segment Cost of goods sold 1,008,805 60.0 % 715,875 50.2 % Gross margin 673,717 40.0 % 711,297 49.8 % Steel segment Cost of goods sold 2,224,366 72.1 % 2,158,499 78.0 % Gross margin 859,286 27.9 % 608,529 22.0 % Power segment Cost of goods sold 110,273 89.4 % 20,242 82.5 % Gross margin 13,049 10.6 % 4,290 17.5 % Mining segment Mining segment cost of goods sold increased by $293.0 million, or 40.9%, to $1,008.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $715.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. Mining segment gross margin percentage decreased to 40.0% in the year ended December 31, 2006 from 49.8% in the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease in the mining segment's gross margin percentage is explained by the sharp decrease of coking and steam coal sales prices on both the export and domestic markets. Steel segment Steel segment cost of goods sold increased by $65.9 million, or 3.1%, to $2,224.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $2,158.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. Steel segment cost of goods sold was 72.1% of the segment's revenues in the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 78.0% in the year ended December 31, 2005, resulting in an increase in gross margin 132 from 22.0% to 27.6%. Such increase is attributable to favorable market prices, particularly on the Russian market, as well as a decrease in production costs at most of our plants following the implementation of cost cutting measures. Power segment Power segment cost of goods sold increased by $90.0 million, or 444.8%, to $110.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $20.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. The power segment cost of goods sold was 89.4% of the segment's revenues in the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 82.5% in the year ended December 31, 2005, resulting in a decrease in gross margin from 17.5% to 10.6%. Such decrease is wholly attributable to the change in nature of Mechel-Energo's activity and the business of this company from pure supporting transactions in 2005 to the business of an intermediary energy company performing mainly intersegment electricity sales and purchases in 2006. Selling, distribution and operating expenses Selling, distribution and operating expenses decreased by $8.2 million, or 1.0%, to $811.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $820.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, selling, distribution and operating expenses decreased to 18.5% in the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 21.6% in the year ended December 31, 2005. Our selling, distribution and operating expenses consist primarily of selling and distribution expenses, taxes other than income tax, loss on write off of property, plant and equipment, provision for doubtful accounts and general, administrative and other operating expenses. The table below sets forth these costs by segment for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, including as a percentage of segment revenues. Year ended December 31, 2006 Year ended December 31, 2005 Selling, distribution and operating expenses by segment Amount % of segment revenues Amount % of segment revenues (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Mining segment Selling and distribution expenses 216,760 12.9 % 190,429 13.3 % Taxes other than income tax 37,311 2.2 % 29,451 2.1 % Loss on write off of property, plant and equipment     Accretion expense 2,344 0.1 % 1,625 0.1 % Provision for doubtful accounts (29 ) 0.0 % 1,071 0.1 % General, administrative and other operating expenses 98,284 5.8 % 93,135 6.4 % Total 354,670 21.0 % 315,711 22.0 % Steel segment Selling and distribution expenses 199,871 6.5 % 259,759 9.4 % Taxes other than income tax 44,536 1.4 % 61,162 2.2 % Loss on write off of property, plant and equipment 2,418 0.1 % 12,667 0.5 % Accretion expense 5,089 0.2 % 1,622 0.1 % Provision for doubtful accounts 2,767 0.1 % 2,338 0.1 % General, administrative and other operating expenses 198,139 6.4 % 164,701 6.1 % Total 452,820 14.7 % 502,249 18.4 % 133 Power segment Selling and distribution expenses 2,270 1.8 % 49 0.2 % Taxes other than income tax 292 0.2 % 72 0.3 % Loss on write off of property, plant and equipment     Accretion expense     Provision for doubtful accounts (16 ) 0.0 % 159 0.6 % General, administrative and other operating expenses 1,853 1.5 % 1,893 7.7 % Total 4,399 3.5 % 2,173 8.8 % Mining segment Selling and distribution expenses consisted almost entirely of transportation expenses related to our selling activities, and increased by $26.4 million in line with sales volume increases in 2006. As a percentage of mining segment revenues, they decreased from 13.3% to 12.9% due to the decrease in our share of mining segment export sales from 55.7% to 48.6%. Taxes other than income tax increased by $7.9 million, or 26.8%, to $37.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $29.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase is mainly explained by the accrual of tax claims, including fines and penalties for mineral extraction and other taxes at Korshunov Mining Plant for the years 2002-2005 in the amount of $27.3 million (including $20.5 million of operating expense), which was partially offset by a gain from the release of an accounting provision for social taxes accrued in previous periods in the amount of $11.0 million for Korshunov Mining Plant following resolution of a claim by the tax authorities in our favor. Provision for doubtful accounts decreased by $1.1 million, or 102.0%, to income of $29 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, due to an improvement in our collection of trade receivables. General, administrative and other expenses increased by $5.1 million, or 5.5%, to $98.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $93.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, representing a decrease as a percentage of segment revenues from 6.4% to 5.8%. Salaries and related social taxes increased by $10.2 million, or 24.6%, to $51.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $41.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, mainly due to indexation of salary rates to inflation at our production companies, increases in management bonuses, and increases in legal and consulting fees and insurance services. Rent and maintenance, business travel expenses, bank charges and office expenses increased by $6.1 million, or 93.6%, to $12.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $6.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, and depreciation increased by $0.6 million, or 23.7%, to $3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $2.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, due to the overall expansion of segment activities in 2006. Finally, additional expenses, including penalties for delays in the delivery of finished goods, security expenses, expenses related to disposal of property, plant and equipment, social expenses, release of provisions for advances paid and other accounts receivable and other expenses, decreased by $14.5 million, or 41.0%, to $20.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $35.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, due to tighter control over administrative expenses resulting in a decrease in fines and penalties and security expenses. 134 Steel segment Selling and distribution expenses consisted almost entirely of transportation expenses related to our selling activities, and decreased as a percentage of steel segment revenues to 6.5% in the year ended December 31, 2006 from 9.4% in the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily as a result of the decrease in the share of export sales from 44.7% to 32.3%. Taxes other than income tax include property and land taxes, and other taxes, and decreased by $16.6 million, or 27.2%, to $44.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $61.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. As a percentage of segment revenues, these taxes decreased from 2.2% to 1.4%. Property and land taxes increased by $6.3 million, or 21.6%, to $35.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $29.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, due to an increase in the property tax base (as a result of putting into operation new fixed assets). At the same time, in the year ended December 31, 2006, our non-deductible VAT expenses decreased by $21.0 million (including $10.0 million claimed as a result of a tax audit of prior periods at certain of our subsidiaries). In December 2005, we decided to restructure the production process for each of Mechel Targoviste and Mechel Campia Turzii in order to increase their efficiency and profitability. As a result of this restructuring, certain production workshops of Mechel Targoviste and Mechel Campia Turzii were discontinued in early 2006, with some property, plant and equipment abandoned rather than disposed of by sale. As of December 31, 2005, the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment at these workshops was $12.7 million and was written off in full. In the year ended December 31, 2006 similar expenses of $2.4 million related to Port Kambarka were written off. Provision for doubtful accounts increased by $0.4 million, or 18.3%,to $2.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, due to changes in our estimate of bad debts as of the respective period ends based on the ageing of the balances. General, administrative and other expenses, which consisted of payroll and related social taxes, depreciation, rent and maintenance, legal and consulting expenses, office expenses and other expenses, increased by $33.4 million, or 20.3%, to $198.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2006, from $164.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, and decreased as a percentage of segment revenues to 6.0% in the year ended December 31, 2006 from 6.1% in the year ended December 31, 2005. Payroll and related social taxes increased by $14.6 million, or 21.7%, to $82.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $67.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, mainly due to indexation of salary rates to inflation at our production companies and also due to increases in management bonuses. Social expenses (including pension) decreased by $4.1 million, or 17.3%, to $19.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $23.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, due to disposal of non-core social divisions of our production entities in 2006, partially offset by increases in charity expenses and donations. Rent and maintenance, business travel expenses, bank charges and office expenses increased by $6.1 million, or 36.2%, to $23.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $16.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to overall expansion of segment activities. Professional expenses, which include auditing, accounting, legal and engineering fees, and insurance services decreased by $1.0 million, or 6.7%, to $15.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $14.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to a decrease in the volume of external consultants' work in 2006. Finally, additional expenses, including directors and officers insurance, penalties for delays in deliveries of finished goods, security expenses and other expenses increased by $22.1 million, or 38.3%, to $79.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $57.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, due to refinement of future asset removal and site restorations costs at our Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant. 135 Power segment In both periods under consideration power segment sales and distribution expenses and other operating expenses were not significant and mostly related to personnel and office expenses of Mechel-Energo. Operating income Operating income increased by $210.0 million, or 40.7%, to $725.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $515.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. Operating income as a percentage of consolidated revenues increased to 16.5% in the year ended December 31, 2006 from 13.6% in the year ended December 31, 2005, due to an increase in the gross margin relating to the favorable market conditions in the steel segment, implementation of cost cutting measures, decreased selling and distribution expenses (due to a change in our sales strategy, namely significant increase of share of domestic sales in both of our segments), decreased taxes other than on income and decreased losses from write-offs of property, plant and equipment. The table below sets out operating income by segment, including as a percentage of segment revenues. Year ended December 31, 2006 Year ended December 31, 2005 Operating income by segment Amount % of segment revenues Amount % of segment revenues (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Mining segment 319,048 19.0 % 395,584 27.7 % Steel segment 406,466 13.2 % 106,281 3.8 % Power segment 8,649 7.0 % 2,118 8.6 % Elimination of intersegment unrealized profit (8,465 ) 11,745 Consolidated operating income 725,698 515,728 Mining segment Mining segment operating income decreased by $76.5 million, or 19.3%, to $319.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $395.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. Operating margin percentage decreased to 19.0% in the year ended December 31, 2006 from 27.7% in the year ended December 31, 2005 due to a decrease in the segment gross profit margin and increases in general, administrative and other expenses. Steel segment Steel segment operating income increased by $300.2 million, or 282.4%, to $406.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $106.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. Operating margin percentage increased to 13.2% in the year ended December 31, 2006 from 3.8% in the year ended December 31, 2005 due to an increase in gross margin percentage, as well as a decrease in selling and distribution expenses, taxes other than on income and losses from write-off of property, plant and equipment. Energy segment Power segment operating income increased by $6.5 million, or 308.4%, to $8.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $2.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. Operating margin percentage decreased to 7.0% from 8.6% due to a decrease in gross margin percentage. 136 Other income and expense, net Other income and expense, net consists of income (loss) of equity investees, interest income, interest expense, gain on revaluation of trading securities, other income and foreign exchange gain. The table below sets forth these costs for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, including as a percentage of revenues. Year ended December 31, 2006 Year ended December 31, 2005 Other income and expense, net Amount % of revenues Amount % of revenues (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Income (loss) from equity investees (9,858 ) (0.2 )% 12,426 0.3 % Interest income 8,314 0.2 % 10,049 0.3 % Interest expense (38,183 ) (0.9 )% (40,829 ) (1.1 )% Gain on revaluation of trading securities 50,688 1.2 %   Other income, net 69,401 1.6 % 65,920 1.7 % Foreign exchange gain (loss) 58,773 1.3 % (37,435 ) (1.0 )% Total 139,135 3.2 % 10,131 0.2 % Most of the loss/income from equity investees in the years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 related to our participation interest in Yakutugol, in which we acquired a 25% + 1 share in 2005. In 2007 we acquired the remaining 75% minus 1 share in Yakutugol. The loss in the year ended December 31, 2006 is due to a decrease of average sales prices and an increase in Yakutugol's production costs. Interest income decreased by $1.7 million, or 17.0%, to $8.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $10.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was due to lower average cash balances held in short-term deposits with financial institutions during 2006. Interest expense decreased by $2.6 million, or 6.5%, to $38.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $40.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was due to lower average loan balances of our companies in 2006. In the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded other income of $69.4 million, primarily consisting of gains related to the forgiveness of restructured tax liabilities (including fines and penalties) in our Russian and Romanian subsidiaries of $69.8 million ($44.6 million in Mechel Targoviste, $9.0 million in Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant, $5.8 million in Southern Urals Nickel Plant). In 2005, we recorded gains on forgiveness of restructured tax liabilities of $38.4 million and gains on accounts payable of $23.3 million. Foreign exchange gain decreased by $96.2 million, or 257.0%, to $58.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from a loss of $37.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. This foreign exchange gain is primarily attributable to gains from revaluation of our cash balances in euro accounts. Income tax expense Income tax expense increased by $94.0 million, or 69.0%, to $230.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $136.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, while our effective tax rate increased to 26.7% from 26.0%. The increase in the absolute figure of income tax expenses is due to the increase in the taxable income of our Russian subsidiaries in 2006. Minority interest Minority interest in income of subsidiaries increased by $24.6 million, or 358.0%, to $31.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $6.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. The 137 minority interest in the income of our subsidiaries in 2006 consisted primarily of the share of minority shareholders in the net income of Southern Urals Nickel Plant of $12.2 million, our coal companies of $8.2 million, Korshunov Mining Plant of $4.7 million and Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant of $2.9 million. Income from continuing operations Income from continuing operations increased by $220.4 million, or 58.0%, to $602.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $382.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, as a result of the factors explained above. Loss from discontinued operations Income from discontinued operations increased by $1.7 million, or 147.0%, to $0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from a loss of $1.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. In both periods, the income related to Mechel Zeljezara. The income in 2006 resulted from a reversal of a provision for bad debts of Mechel Zeljezara recorded in prior periods due to the settlement of such debts. Mechel Zeljezara performed its activities until August 2004 when we decided to terminate production; in 2006 no significant activities were performed by this company. Net income For the reasons set forth above, our net income increased by $222.0 million, or 58.3%, to $603.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $381.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital requirements Our principal ongoing financing requirements are to finance our mining operations and production of steel and steel products, and to a lesser extent, our power segment and logistics assets, and to fund the following major activities: Future growth through acquisitions; Capital expenditures, including the purchase of equipment and the modernization of our facilities; Retirement of our short-term and portions of our long-term debt; Changes in working capital; and General corporate purposes. We anticipate that acquisitions, capital expenditures and repayments of outstanding debt will represent the most significant uses of funds for the next several years. We continue to consider acquisitions as one of our major growth strategies. Historically, funding of this strategy came from cash flows from existing operations, external financing sources and our shareholders in the form of contributions to our charter capital. We intend to finance acquisitions in the future through a mix of cash flow generated by our business, as well as external debt and offerings of securities in the international capital markets, such as equity and equity-related securities. Our business is heavily dependent on plant and machinery for the production of steel and steel products, as well as investments in our mining operations. Investments to maintain and expand production facilities are, accordingly, an important priority and have a significant effect on our cash flows and future results of operations. We expect our capital expenditures to increase significantly in the next few years. See "
