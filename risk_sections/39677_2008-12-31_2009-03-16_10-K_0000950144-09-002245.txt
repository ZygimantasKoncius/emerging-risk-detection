Risk Factors Â— continued Our joint ventures and equity partnerships may not achieve anticipated results We may seek additional joint venture or equity partnership arrangements. A joint venture or equity partnership may involve special risks associated with the possibility that a partner or partnership at any time (i) may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, (ii) may take actions contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives with respect to our real estate investments or (iii) could experience financial difficulties. Actions by a partner may have the result of subjecting property owned by the joint venture or equity partnership to liabilities in excess of those contemplated by the terms of the joint venture or equity partnership agreement or have other adverse consequences. We cannot assure that any joint venture or equity partnership arrangements will achieve the results anticipated or otherwise prove successful. Our business is subject to substantial competition Our residential homebuilding, planned community development and other real estate operations are subject to significant competition from distressed sales. We currently compete with foreclosure sales as well as resales by investors, speculators, foreclosing lenders and residents in our communities. For sales of new housing units, we compete, as to price and product, with several national and regional homebuilding companies. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation and environmental considerations Our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, ordinances and regulations that affect every aspect of our business such as environmental, hazardous waste and land use requirements and can result in substantial expense to the company. Certain events could trigger the acceleration of payment of the 4.50% Notes Certain events could result in a default under our 4.50% Notes. These include cessation of trading of our common stock, failure to pay interest when due on our 4.50% Notes, and final judgment(s) for the payment of money in excess of $20,000 rendered against us or any of our subsidiaries if not discharged for any periods of 30 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement is not in effect. Such default would result in the requirement for payment of the 4.50% Notes prior to the due date thereof. Our inability to make such accelerated payment could have a material adverse effect upon our business. Failure to purchase replacement property or obtain an extension of time in which to do so could result in a reduction in available cash In 2006, we sold land under the threat of condemnation which we believe entitled us to defer the payment of income taxes of $23,798 from the gain on this sale. We have not yet identified replacement property although it is our intention to do so by December 31, 2009. It is possible that we may not identify and purchase such replacement property within the required time period or obtain an extension of time in which to do so which would require us to make this income tax payment and interest as of December 31, 2009 which would result in a reduction in available cash.
