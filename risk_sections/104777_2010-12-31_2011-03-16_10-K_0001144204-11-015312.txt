Item 1A. RISK FACTORS. RISK FACTORS We have a history of operating losses and there is no assurance we will generate profits in the future. We have a history of operating losses. We have sustained operating losses of $8,671, $4,329 and $1,236 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We cannot predict if we will generate profitable operations in the future. If we cannot generate profits in the future, our failure to do so could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to raise additional equity capital or to incur additional debt. We provide services to customers over access lines. If access lines decline, operating results may be adversely affected. Our business generates revenues by delivering voice, video and data services over access lines. We continue to experience access line losses due to competition from wireless and broadband service providers. We may continue to experience access line losses in our primary markets. Our inability to retain access lines could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We are subject to competition that may adversely impact us. As an ILEC, we historically faced little competition in our markets. As a direct result of deregulation, we now face direct competition in our traditional ILEC territories by CLEC operations and other providers of telecommunications services that offer comparable voice, video and data products. The primary competitor in our market has brand recognition and financial, personnel, marketing and other resources that are significantly greater than ours. In addition, consolidations and strategic alliances within the telecommunications industry, as well as ongoing technological innovation, are likely to affect our competitive position. We cannot predict the number of competitors that will ultimately emerge, but increased competition from existing and new entities could have an adverse effect on our business. With increased substitution of wireless for landline services, wireless carriers are now competing aggressively for our voice customers. We may not be able to successfully integrate new technologies, respond effectively to customer requirements or provide new services. The communications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology, the development of new types of content, frequent new service offerings and a changing regulatory and economic environment. We cannot predict the changes in our competitive position or profitability. Technological developments may reduce the competitiveness of our networks and require significant expenditures of capital to upgrade and/or replace outdated technologies. In addition, new products and services arising out of technological developments in the industry may reduce the attractiveness of our products and services. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological changes or obsolescence, or fail to obtain access to important new technologies or content, we could lose existing customers and fail to attract new customers. For this reason, we have developed video offerings and a VoIP product. A key element of our long-term growth strategy is our ability to deliver new and enhanced products and services to our customers. The successful delivery of new products and services is uncertain and dependent on many factors. There is no guarantee that delivery of these services will generate the anticipated increase in customers and revenues. Our relationships with other communications companies are material to our operations. We originate and terminate calls for long distance carriers and other interexchange carriers over our network and for that service we receive payments for access charges. These payments represent a significant portion of our revenues. Should these carriers go bankrupt or experience substantial financial difficulties, our inability to collect access charges from them could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations. 9 TABLE OF CONTENTS A significant portion of our income is derived from our O-P Limited Partnership. We rely significantly on income derived from our O-P partnership interest. The need for increased capital improvements to upgrade or expand the O-P facilities or a decrease in demand for services or continued competitive pressure on rates could cause O-PÂ’s profitability to decline and could thereby reduce the income that we derive from those profits. We receive quarterly cash distributions from O-P, which comprises a substantial percentage of our cash flow. O-P distributions are made at the discretion of the O-P general partner. The failure of the general partner to make a cash distribution to the limited partners or decreases in distributions in any quarter would have a significant negative impact on our business. We recently learned that our O-P general partner has decided to exclude future income which may be derived from the latest technological advance in cellular services (known as 4G) from the O-P partnership. We have notified our general partner that we strenuously object to this determination and we are exploring all rights we have as a limited partner under our agreement. We have been advised by our general partner that this decision will not have any short term adverse impact on the income we derive from O-P. Assuming our general partner continues to take this position or that we cannot come to mutually satisfactory and acceptable terms over the use of 4G by O-P or other alternative arrangements, it remains unclear what type of long term impact the exclusion of 4G related income will have on our O-P income beyond the next 12 months. We are subject to significant regulations that could change in a manner that is adverse to our interests, or could remain in effect in such a way that impedes our ability to compete. We operate in a heavily-regulated industry. A significant portion of our revenues generally have been supported by regulations that provide for local and network access revenues and USF funds. Potential changes in the funding and/or payout rules for the USF might further reduce our revenues obtained from the USF. Reforms of the USF are the subject of pending legislation in Congress. We cannot predict the level of USF funding we will receive in the future as a result of USF reforms. Proposed USF reforms may have a significant negative impact on our business. Laws and regulations applicable to us and our competitors have, from time to time, been challenged in the courts, and could be changed by the FCC or state regulators. On February 9, 2011, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (WC Docket No. 10-90 et al.) in which it proposes to make substantial and comprehensive revisions to its rules and regulations relating to universal service high cost support and intercarrier compensation in support of its efforts to increase broadband deployment and use nationwide. It is possible that an order in that FCC proceeding could result in negative financial consequences including a reduction in our intercarrier compensation revenues, federal USF receipts, our interconnection and intercarrier compensation expenses, and the rates charged to our retail customers. No decision or resolution of inter-carrier compensation has yet been forthcoming, and we cannot predict the impact of such decision or resolution. Regulatory changes could adversely impact the rates we are permitted to charge our customers, reduce payments to us from the USF or restrict our ability to effectively compete in the market place. Regulatory changes could also restrict our ability to secure new sources of capital and/or grow through strategic acquisitions or alliances. In addition, the failure of regulations to change in a manner that would establish an environment in which we may compete on more even terms with our actual economic competitors could also adversely affect our profitability. Weak economic conditions may impact demand for our services. We could realize a change in demand for services due to the ongoing weak economic conditions. Downturns in the economy and continued competition in our markets may cause some of our existing customers to disconnect or scale back basic and enhanced services, broadband Internet or video service, and it may become more difficult for us to acquire new customers. Furthermore, the current weak economic condition may prolong our payment collections interval and in some cases increase our need to discontinue service for nonpayment. The decline in pension plan assets during 2008 significantly increased pension plan expense and required contributions during 2009. With the subsequent increase in pension plan assets during 2010, our anticipated contribution to the pension plan is expected to decline during 2011. If market conditions result in a decrease in pension plan assets during 2011, required pension plan contributions may increase in 2012. 10 TABLE OF CONTENTS Risks associated with our unfunded pension liability. As of December 31, 2010, our unfunded pension liability was $4,330. We have managed this liability from a high of $7,240 in 2008. While we believe our current cash position coupled with expected cash management and monitoring of our pension funds makes this a manageable risk, if the stock market declines significantly or interest rates fluctuate or become volatile, it will be more difficult for us to manage this risk.
