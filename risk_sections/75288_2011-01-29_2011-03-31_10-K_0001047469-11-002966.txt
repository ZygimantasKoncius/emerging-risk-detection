Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business faces many risks, many of which are outside of our control. The following factors, as well as factors described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the SEC that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results, should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impact our business operations or financial results. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected. 21 Table of Contents Our business is and will continue to be heavily influenced by economic trends and general economic conditions, which may be exacerbated by global political or economic uncertainty resulting from recent events, and a deterioration or worsening of consumer confidence or consumer purchases of discretionary products may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending, which changes as regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Often, the apparel industry experiences longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy. Overall economic conditions that affect discretionary consumer spending include, but are not limited to, employment levels, recessions, energy costs, interest rates, tax rates, personal debt levels, housing prices and stock market volatility. Uncertainty about the future may also impact the level of consumer confidence or discretionary consumer spending or result in shifts in consumer spending to products other than apparel. Any deterioration in general economic or political conditions, acts of war or terrorism or other factors that create uncertainty or alter the discretionary consumer habits in our key markets, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom, could reduce our sales, increase our costs of goods sold or require us to significantly modify our current business practices and, consequently, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These and other events that impact our operating results could also result in adverse consequences to our business, such as our inability to comply with financial covenants under our debt instruments. The economies of the United States, United Kingdom and other parts of the world weakened as a result of the global economic crisis which commenced in 2008 and continued through 2009. We saw intermittent signs of stabilization in economic conditions in the United States and globally during fiscal 2010, but there are no assurances that the global economy will continue to recover. Those recessionary conditions have adversely impacted retail sales of apparel and other consumer products, and have impacted our business. In addition, concerns regarding acts of terrorism, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, political unrest throughout the Middle East and the March 2011 earthquake in Japan, among other events, have created significant global economic and political uncertainties that may affect consumer demand for our products in the United States and other parts of the world, as well as result in disruptions to sourcing of our products from Asian markets. These or similar factors could consequently reduce our sales and/or increase our costs of goods sold. Additionally, significant changes in the operations or liquidity for any of the parties with which we conduct our business, including suppliers, customers, trademark licensees and lenders, among others, now or in the future, or in the access to capital markets for us or any such parties, could result in lower demand for our products, lower sales, higher costs or other disruptions in our business. Our success depends on the reputation and value of our owned and licensed brand names, including, in particular, Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Ben Sherman, and actions by us, our wholesale customers, licensees or others who have interests in our brands could diminish the reputation or value of our brands and adversely affect our business operations. The success of our business depends on the reputation and value of our owned and licensed brand names. The value of our brands could be diminished by actions taken by us, for instance by becoming overly promotional, or by our wholesale customers or others, including marketing partners, who have interests in the brands. We cannot always control the marketing and promotion of our products by our wholesale customers or other third parties and actions by such parties that are inconsistent with our own marketing efforts or that otherwise adversely affect the appeal of our products could diminish the value or reputation of one or more of our brands and have an adverse effect on our sales and business operations. In addition, we license certain of our brands, such as Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Ben Sherman, to third party licensees. While we take significant steps to ensure the reputation of our 22 Table of Contents brands is maintained through our license agreements, there can be no guarantee our brands will not be negatively impacted through our association with products outside of our core apparel products or due to the actions of a licensee. The improper or detrimental actions of a licensee could significantly impact the perception of our brands. The apparel industry is subject to rapidly evolving fashion trends, and we must continuously offer innovative and market appropriate products to maintain and grow our existing businesses. Failure to offer innovative and market appropriate products may adversely affect our sales and lead to excess inventory, markdowns and/or dilution of our brands. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are design, brand image, consumer preference, price, quality, marketing and customer service. Although certain of our products carry over from season to season, the apparel industry in general is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and shifting consumer demands. In particular, we believe that our lifestyle branded Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Ben Sherman products may be more susceptible to changing fashion trends and consumer preferences than apparel products generally. Accordingly, we must anticipate, identify and capitalize upon emerging fashion trends. We believe that our success depends on our ability to continuously develop, source, market and deliver a wide variety of innovative, fashionable and desirable brands and products. These products must be offered at appropriate price points in their respective distribution channels. Sales growth from our brands will depend largely upon our ability to continue to maintain and enhance the distinctive brand identities. Due to the competitive nature of the apparel industry, there can be no assurance that the demand for our products will not decline or that we will be able to successfully evaluate and adapt our products to align with consumers' preferences, fashion trends and changes in consumer demographics. As is typical with new products, market acceptance of new price points and designs is subject to uncertainty. The introduction or repositioning of new lines and products often requires substantial costs in design, marketing and advertising, which may not be recovered if the products are not successful. Any failure on our part to develop appealing products and update core products could result in lower sales and/or harm the reputation and desirability of our brands. Additionally, since we generally make decisions regarding product designs several months in advance of the time when consumer acceptance can be measured, such a failure could leave us with a substantial amount of unsold excess inventory, which we may be forced to sell at lower price points. Any of these factors could result in a deterioration of the appeal of our brands and products, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and operating results. Our business is subject to legal, regulatory, political and economic risks, including risks relating to the importation of our products, and our products may become less competitive as a result of adverse changes affecting our operations. As we source substantially all of our products from foreign countries, including approximately 75% of our product purchases from China during fiscal 2010, we are exposed to risks associated with changes in the laws and regulations governing the importing and exporting of apparel products into and from the countries in which we operate. Some of the risks associated with importing our products from foreign countries include quotas imposed by countries in which our products are manufactured or countries into which our products are imported, which limit the amount and type of goods that may be imported annually from or into these countries; changes in social, political, labor and economic conditions or terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers are located; the imposition of additional or new duties, tariffs, taxes or other charges and shifts in sourcing patterns as a result of such charges; significant fluctuations in the cost of raw materials; significant delays in the delivery of our products, due to security considerations; rapid fluctuations in sourcing costs, including costs for raw 23 Table of Contents materials and labor; the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duties; fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies; and restrictions on the transfer of funds to or from foreign countries. The imposition of a quota arrangement between the United States and China on our products, or the elimination of duty-free treatment or our inability to qualify for such benefits, would adversely impact our business by increasing our cost of goods sold. In addition, our products are subject to increasingly stringent and complex product performance and safety standards, laws and other regulations, such as the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 and California Proposition 65, particularly given the concentration of our retail stores in the State of California. Failure to comply with such regulations could result in a delay, non-delivery or mandated destruction of inventory shipments during key seasons, financial penalties and/or harm to our reputation and business relationships, and compliance with existing and future regulations could increase our cost of goods sold. Our, or any of our suppliers', failure to comply with customs or similar laws or any other applicable regulations could restrict our ability to import products or lead to fines, penalties or adverse publicity, and future regulatory actions or trade agreements may provide our competitors with a material advantage over us or materially increase our costs. Significant fluctuations and volatility in the price of raw materials and freight may materially increase our costs, some or all of which we may be unable to pass on to our customers. Most of the products we purchase from third-party producers are package purchases, and we and our third-party suppliers rely on the availability of raw materials at reasonable prices. The principal fabrics used in our business are cotton, linens, wools, silk, other natural fibers, synthetics and blends of these materials. The prices paid for these fabrics depend on the market price for raw materials used to produce them. We have seen a sustained increase in the costs of raw materials, particularly cotton, as a result of rising demand from the economic recovery, weather-related supply disruptions, significant declines in U.S. inventory and a sharp rise in the futures market for cotton, which has been compounded by increased costs of transportation of our products as a result of sustained increases in oil prices. In addition, the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process, such as oil-related commodity prices and other raw materials, such as dyes and chemicals, and other costs, can fluctuate. We historically have not entered into any futures contracts to hedge commodity prices. Any significant increase in the price of raw materials or freight may materially increase our costs, some or all of which we may be unable to pass on to our customers. We are dependent upon the ability of our third-party producers, substantially all of whom are located in foreign countries, to meet our requirements; any failures by these producers to meet our requirements, or the unavailability of suitable producers at reasonable prices may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis or result in higher costs or reduced net sales. We source substantially all of our products from non-exclusive, third-party producers located in foreign countries. Although we place a high value on long-term relationships with our suppliers, generally we do not have long-term contracts but, instead, conduct business on an order-by-order basis. Therefore, we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers. We regularly depend upon the ability of third-party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity. Although we monitor production in third- party manufacturing locations, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as the reduction of availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs. Such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to 24 Table of Contents our customers on a timely basis, which may, in turn, have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales. We also require third-party producers to meet certain standards in terms of working conditions, environmental protection and other matters before placing business with them. As a result of costs relating to compliance with these standards, we may pay higher prices than some of our competitors for products. In addition, failure by us or our independent manufacturers to adhere to labor or other laws or business practices accepted as ethical, and the potential litigation, negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events, could disrupt our operations or harm our reputation. The apparel industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competitive threats to our business from various third parties that could reduce our sales, increase our costs, reduce price points for our products, and/or decrease margins. The highly competitive apparel industry includes numerous domestic and foreign apparel designers, manufacturers, distributors, importers, licensors and retailers, some of which may also be our customers and some of whom are significantly larger and have significantly greater financial resources than we do. The level and nature of our competition varies, and the number of our direct competitors and the intensity of competition may increase as we expand into other markets or product lines or as other companies expand into our markets or product lines. Some of our competitors may be able to adapt to changes in consumer demand more quickly, to devote greater resources to establishing brand recognition or to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. Additionally, certain of our competitors offer apparel for sale at significant discounts, particularly in response to weak economic conditions, which results in more pressure to reduce prices or the risk that our products may not be as desirable as lower priced products. These competitive factors within the apparel industry may result in reduced sales, increased costs, lower prices for our products and/or decreased margins. Our concentration of retail stores and wholesale customers for certain of our products exposes us to certain regional risks. Our retail locations are heavily concentrated in certain geographic areas in the United States, including Florida and California for our Tommy Bahama retail stores, Florida for our Lilly Pulitzer retail stores and the United Kingdom for our Ben Sherman retail stores. As of January 29, 2011, 41 out of our 89 Tommy Bahama retail stores were located in these two U.S. states, five out of our 16 Lilly Pulitzer retail stores were located in Florida and more than half of our owned Ben Sherman retail stores, including outlets, were located in the United Kingdom. Additionally, a significant portion of our wholesale sales for Tommy Bahama and Ben Sherman products are concentrated in the same geographic areas as our own retail store locations for these brands. Due to this concentration, we have heightened exposure to factors that impact these regions, including general economic conditions, weather patterns, natural disasters, changing demographics and other factors. We depend on a group of key customers for a significant portion of our wholesale sales. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer's financial position could negatively impact our net sales and profitability. We generate a significant percentage of our wholesale sales from a few major customers. During fiscal 2010, sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately 46% of our consolidated wholesale sales and sales to our largest wholesale customer represented approximately 16% of our consolidated wholesale sales. A decrease in the number of stores that carry our products, restructuring of our customers' operations, more centralized purchasing decisions, direct sourcing and greater leverage by customers, as a result of further consolidation in the retail industry or otherwise could result in lower prices, realignment of customer affiliations or other factors which could negatively impact our net sales and profitability. 25 Table of Contents We generally do not have long-term contracts with any of our customers. Instead, we rely on long-standing relationships with these customers and our position within the marketplace. As a result, purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis, and each relationship can generally be terminated by either party at any time. A decision by one or more major customers to terminate its relationship with us or to reduce its purchases from us, whether motivated by competitive considerations, quality or style issues, financial difficulties, economic conditions or otherwise, could adversely affect our net sales and profitability, as it would be difficult to immediately, if at all, replace this business with new customers or increase sales volumes with other existing customers. In addition, due to long product lead times, several of our product lines are designed and manufactured in anticipation of orders for sale. We make commitments for fabric and production in connection with these lines. These commitments can be made up to several months prior to the receipt of firm orders from customers, and if orders do not materialize or are canceled, we may incur expenses to terminate our fabric and production commitments or to dispose of excess inventories. We also extend credit to several of our key customers without requiring collateral, which results in a large amount of receivables from just a few customers. During the past several years, companies in the apparel industry, including some of our customers, have had financial difficulties and have experienced tightened credit markets and declining sales and profitability on a comparable store basis. If one or more of our key customers experiences significant problems in the future, including as a result of general weakness in the apparel industry, our sales may be reduced, and the risk associated with extending credit to these customers may increase. A significant adverse change in a customer's financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer's receivables or limit our ability to collect amounts related to previous shipments to that customer. These or other events related to our significant customers could adversely affect our net sales and profitability. The acquisition of new businesses, such as our recent acquisition of the Lilly Pulitzer brand and operations, has certain inherent risks, including, for example, strains on our management team, unexpected acquisition costs, and, in some instances, contingent payments. One component of our business strategy is the acquisition of new businesses or product lines as and when appropriate investment opportunities are available. Consistent with this strategy, in December 2010, we acquired the Lilly Pulitzer brand and operations. In connection with our acquisition of the Lilly Pulitzer brand and operations, or in any future acquisitions, we may become responsible for unexpected liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence. Although we have required the selling shareholders of Sugartown to indemnify us against undisclosed liabilities, we cannot assure you that the indemnification, even if obtained, will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or assets acquired. Any of these liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, integrating acquired businesses is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. The integration process for newly acquired businesses, including the Lilly Pulitzer brand and operations, could create for us a number of challenges and adverse consequences associated with the integration of product lines, employees, sales teams and outsourced manufacturers; employee turnover, including key management and creative personnel of the acquired and existing businesses; disruption in product cycles for newly acquired product lines; maintenance of acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; and the impairment of relationships with customers of the acquired and existing businesses. Further, we may not be able to manage the combined operations and assets effectively or realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. 26 Table of Contents In connection with our acquisition of the Lilly Pulitzer brand and operations, we entered into a contingent consideration agreement with the selling shareholders that may require us to pay up to $20 million in performance-based contingent payments to those shareholders over the next four years. Although we will only be required to make these payments if the acquired business is successful, the contingent payments are payable based on that business achieving earnings targets. If the acquired Sugartown business is successful but the rest of our business is not successful, we may have difficulty making the contingent payments. The principal shareholders of Sugartown from whom we acquired the business are key members of management of our Lilly Pulitzer Group. It is possible that their interests with respect to the contingent payments will differ from our interests or those of our shareholders. Our operations are reliant on information technology, and any interruption or other failure in our information technology systems, including disruptions at any of our principal distribution facilities, may impair our ability to compete effectively in the apparel industry, including our ability to provide services to our customers and meet the needs of management. The efficient operation of our business is dependent on information technology. Information systems are used in all stages of our operations from design to distribution and as a method of communication with our customers and suppliers. Additionally, certain of our operating groups utilize e-commerce websites to sell goods directly to consumers. Our management also relies on information systems to provide relevant and accurate information in order to allocate resources and forecast and report our operating results. Service interruptions may occur as a result of a number of factors, including computer viruses, hacking or other unlawful activities by third parties, disasters, or failures to properly install, upgrade, integrate, protect, repair or maintain our systems and e-commerce websites. Any material disruption in our information technology systems, or any failure to timely, efficiently and effectively integrate new systems, could have an adverse affect on our business or results of operations. In addition, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our primary distribution facilities, some of which are owned and others of which are operated by third parties. Finished garments from our contractors are inspected and stored at these distribution facilities. If any of these distribution facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, or if the goods in the distribution center were otherwise unavailable for shipment, as a result of a technology failure or otherwise, we could experience a reduction in sales, a substantial loss of inventory or higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the facility or to restore the technological capabilities of the facility. This could negatively affect our operating results and our customer relationships. Compliance with privacy and information laws and requirements could be costly, and a breach of information security or privacy could adversely affect our business. The regulatory environment governing our use of individually identifiable data of customers, employees and others is complex and a matter of growing public concern. Privacy and information security laws and requirements change frequently, and compliance with them may require us to incur costs to make necessary systems changes and implement new administrative processes. If a data security breach occurs, our reputation could be damaged and we could experience lost sales, fines or lawsuits. Our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels. We schedule production from third party manufacturers based on our expectations for the demand for our products. However, various factors could result in variances from our forecasts. As a result, we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory, which may result in inventory markdowns or the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices. These events could significantly harm our operating results and impair the image of our brands. 27 Table of Contents Conversely, we may not be in a position to order quality products from our manufacturers in a timely manner and/or we may experience inventory shortages as demand for our products increases, which might result in unfilled orders, negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty and result in lost revenues, any of which could harm our business. We operate in various countries with differing laws and regulations, which may impair our ability to maintain compliance with regulations and laws. Although we attempt to abide by the laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate, the complexity of the laws and regulations to which we are subject, including customs regulations, labor laws, competition laws, consumer protection laws and domestic and international tax legislation, makes it difficult for us to ensure that we are currently, or will be in the future, compliant with all laws and regulations. We may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, and unfavorable resolution to litigation or a violation of applicable laws and regulations may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business. We may not be successful in identifying locations and negotiating appropriate lease terms for retail stores and restaurants. An integral part of our strategy has been to develop and operate retail stores and restaurants for certain of our lifestyle brands. Net sales from retail stores and restaurants were approximately 43% of our consolidated net sales during fiscal 2010. Successful operation of our retail stores and restaurants depends, in part, on the overall ability of the retail location to attract a consumer base sufficient to make store sales volume profitable. If we are unable to identify new locations with consumer traffic sufficient to support a profitable sales level, retail growth may consequently be limited. Further, if existing retail stores and restaurants do not maintain a sufficient customer base that provides a reasonable sales volume, it could have a negative impact on our sales, gross margin, and results of operations. From time to time, we seek to downsize or close some of our retail store or restaurant operations, which may require a modification or termination of an existing lease; such actions may require payment of exit fees and/or result in fixed asset impairment charges, the amounts of which could be material. In addition, there has been some recent consolidation among commercial real estate developers, mall operators and/or shopping center managers. Significant consolidation within the commercial real estate development, operation and/or management industries impacting locations where we might operate retail stores and/or restaurants or that we might otherwise consider desirable could reduce our leverage with such parties, thereby materially adversely affecting the terms of future leases for our retail stores and restaurants or making entering into long-term commitments with such parties cost prohibitive. Our business, in particular our retail and restaurant operations, is subject to state and local laws and regulations for health, safety, labor and similar operational issues. The costs of compliance with, or the violation of, such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our costs or operations, and we may be adversely impacted by negative publicity surrounding any of these issues. We operate retail stores and restaurants in numerous jurisdictions. Our retail and restaurant operations are subject to comprehensive state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of employment, safety and other matters. The complexity of these laws and regulations to which we are subject, which may vary widely by jurisdiction, makes it difficult for us to ensure that we are currently, or will be in the future, compliant with all laws and regulations. We may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws or 28 Table of Contents regulations, and unfavorable resolution to litigation or a violation of applicable laws and regulations may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business. In addition, the restaurant industry is highly competitive and requires compliance with a variety of federal, state and local regulations. In particular, all of our Tommy Bahama restaurants serve alcohol and, therefore, maintain liquor licenses. Our ability to maintain our liquor licenses depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The loss of a liquor license would adversely affect the profitability of a restaurant. Additionally, as a participant in the restaurant industry, we face risks related to food quality, food-borne illness, injury, health inspection scores and labor relations. Regardless of whether allegations related to these matters are valid or whether we become liable, we may be materially affected by negative publicity associated with these issues. The negative impact of adverse publicity relating to one restaurant may extend beyond the restaurant involved to affect some or all of the other restaurants, as well as the image of the Tommy Bahama brand as a whole. We may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property or may otherwise have our brand names harmed. We believe that our registered and common law trademarks and other intellectual property, as well as other contractual arrangements, including licenses and other proprietary intellectual property rights, have significant value and are important to our continued success and our competitive position due to their recognition by retailers and consumers. Approximately 85% of our net sales in fiscal 2010 were attributable to branded products for which we own the trademark. Therefore, our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property. We rely on laws in the United States and other countries to protect our proprietary rights. However, we may not be able to sufficiently prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. The use of our intellectual property or similar intellectual property by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, causing us to lose sales or otherwise harm the reputation of our brands. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the actions that we have taken will be adequate to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights. Although we have not been materially inhibited from selling products in connection with trademark disputes, as we extend our brands into new product categories and new product lines and expand the geographic scope of our marketing, including internationally, we could become subject to litigation based on allegations of the infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties. In the event a claim of infringement against us is successful, we may be required to pay damages, royalties or license fees to continue to use intellectual property rights that we had been using, or we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time. Litigation and other legal action of this type, regardless of whether it is successful, could result in substantial costs to us and diversion of our management and other resources. Our business depends on our senior management and other key personnel, and the unexpected loss of individuals integral to our business, our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future or our failure to successfully plan for and implement succession of our senior management and key personnel may have an adverse effect on our operations, business relationships and ability to execute our strategies. Our senior management has substantial experience and expertise in the apparel and related industries. Our success depends upon disciplined execution at all levels of our organization, including the members of our senior management. Competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense, and we compete to attract and retain these individuals with other companies which may have greater financial resources. In addition, we will need to plan for the succession of our senior management and successfully integrate new members of management within our organization. This may 29 Table of Contents include situations in which individuals join our company as a result of acquisitions that we make, such as the recent employment of the principals of the Lilly Pulitzer brand and operations to lead our Lilly Pulitzer Group, and may be more familiar with certain of the operational aspects of acquired businesses than other members of our management. The unexpected loss of any of our senior management, or the unsuccessful integration of new leadership, could negatively affect our operations, business relationships and ability to execute our strategies. Our foreign sourcing operations as well as the sale of products in foreign markets result in an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result of our international operations, we are exposed to certain risks in conducting business outside of the United States. Substantially all of our orders for the production of apparel in foreign countries are denominated in U.S. dollars. Purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers, either of which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the future. If the value of the U.S. dollar decreases relative to certain foreign currencies in the future, then the prices that we negotiate for products could increase, and it is possible that we would not be able to pass this increase on to customers, which would negatively impact our margins. If the value of the U.S. dollar increases between the time a price is set and payment for a product, the price we pay may be higher than that paid for comparable goods by competitors that pay for goods in local currencies, and these competitors may be able to sell their products at more competitive prices. Additionally, currency fluctuations could also disrupt the business of our independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and difficult to finance. We received U.S. dollars for approximately 90% of our product sales during fiscal 2010. The sales denominated in foreign currencies primarily relate to Ben Sherman sales in the United Kingdom and Europe. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to these other currencies in which we have sales could result in lower levels of sales and earnings in our consolidated statements of operations, although the sales in foreign currencies could be equal to or greater than amounts in prior periods. In addition, to the extent that the stronger U.S. dollar increases costs, and the products are sold in another currency, but the additional cost cannot be passed on to our customers, our gross margins will be negatively impacted. We generally do not engage in hedging activities with respect to our exposure to foreign currency risk except that, on occasion, we do purchase foreign currency forward exchange contracts for our goods purchased on U.S. dollar terms that are expected to be sold in the United Kingdom and Europe. We hold licenses for the use of other parties' brand names, and we cannot guarantee our continued use of such brand names or the quality or salability of such brand names. We have entered into license and design agreements to use certain trademarks and trade names, such as Kenneth Cole, Dockers and Geoffrey Beene, to market our products. Approximately 8% of our net sales during fiscal 2010 related to the products for which we license the use of the trademark for specific product categories. These license and design agreements will expire at various dates in the future. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew these licenses on acceptable terms upon expiration or that we will be able to acquire new licenses to use other popular trademarks. The termination or expiration of a license agreement will cause us to lose the sales and any associated profits generated pursuant to such license and in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related intangible assets. In addition to certain compliance obligations, all of our significant licenses provide minimum thresholds for royalty payments and advertising expenditures for each license year, which we must pay regardless of the level of our sales of the licensed products. If these thresholds are not met, our licensors may be permitted contractually to terminate these agreements or seek payment of minimum 30 Table of Contents royalties even if the minimum sales are not achieved. In addition, our licensors produce their own products and license their trademarks to other third parties, and we are unable to control the quality of these goods that others produce. If licensors or others do not maintain the quality of these trademarks or if the brand image deteriorates, our sales and any associated profits generated by such brands may decline. We make use of debt to finance our operations, which exposes us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial position and operating results. Our levels of debt vary as a result of the seasonality of our business, investments in acquisitions and working capital and divestitures. As of January 29, 2011, we had $150 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 113/8% Senior Secured Notes and no borrowings outstanding under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement or our U.K. Revolving Credit Agreement. Our debt levels may increase in the future under our existing facilities or potentially under new facilities, or the terms or forms of our financing arrangements in the future may change. There are no assurances that in the future we will be able to refinance our debt obligations on terms that are satisfactory to us. Our indebtedness includes, and any future indebtedness may include, certain obligations and limitations, including the periodic payment of principal and interest, maintenance of certain covenants and certain other limitations related to additional debt, dividend payments, investments and dispositions of assets. Our ability to satisfy these obligations will be dependent upon our business, financial condition and operating results. These obligations and limitations may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and limit our flexibility in carrying out our business plan and planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate. In addition, we have interest rate risk on indebtedness under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement and U.K. Revolving Credit Agreement. We generally do not engage in hedging activities with respect to our interest rate risk, and an increase in interest rates may require us to pay a greater amount of our funds from operations towards interest, even if the amount of borrowings outstanding remains the same. As a result, we may have to revise or delay our business plans, reduce or delay capital expenditures or otherwise adjust our plans for operations. We may be unable to successfully execute a key component of our business strategy, which is to grow our business through organic growth and/or, if and when appropriate, acquisitions of lifestyle brands that fit within our business model, and any failure to successfully execute this aspect of our business strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. One key component of our business strategy is to grow our business through organic growth and/or, if and when appropriate, acquisitions of lifestyle brands that fit within our business model, such as our acquisition of the Lilly Pulitzer brand and operations in December 2010. Organic growth may be achieved by, among other things, increasing our market share in existing markets, including to existing wholesale customers; selling our products in new markets, including international markets; increasing sales in our direct-to-consumer channels; and increasing the product offerings within our various operating groups. Successful growth of our business through organic growth and/or acquisitions is subject to, among other things, the ability of our management to implement plans for expanding our existing businesses and our ability to find suitable acquisition candidates at reasonable prices in the future. We may not be successful in this regard, and our inability to grow our business may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 31 Table of Contents Divestitures of certain businesses or discontinuations of certain product lines may require us to find alternative uses for our resources. As we did in fiscal 2010 with the sale of substantially all of the operations and assets of our former Oxford Apparel Group and as we did during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 with the restructuring of our operations at Ben Sherman, Lanier Clothes and our former Oxford Apparel Group, we may determine that it is appropriate to divest or discontinue certain operations. Divestitures of certain businesses that do not align with our strategy or the discontinuation of certain product lines which may not provide the returns that we expect or desire may result in underutilization of our resources in the event that the operations are not replaced with new lines of business either internally or through acquisition. There can be no guarantee that if we divest certain businesses or discontinue certain product lines that we will be able to replace the sales and profits related to these businesses or appropriately utilize our remaining resources, which may result in a decline in our operating results and/or result in an inappropriate capitalization of our organization. Our operations are influenced by weather patterns and natural or man-made disasters. Like other companies in the apparel industry, our sales volume and operations may be adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions or natural or man-made disasters, which may cause consumers to alter their purchasing habits or result in a disruption to our operations. Because of the seasonality of our business, the concentration of a significant proportion of our customers in certain geographic regions, the concentration of our sourcing operations and the concentration of our distribution operations, the occurrence of such events could disproportionately impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
