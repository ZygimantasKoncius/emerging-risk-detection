Item 1A. Risk Factors The following risk factors and other information included in this Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks come to fruition, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Revenue Although our financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, our management and our independent registered public accounting firm, in its report accompanying our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, believe that our recurring losses from operations and other factors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as of December 31, 2013. Our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, were prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that we will continue in operation for the next twelve months and will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from our inability to continue as a going concern. Our need for additional capital and the uncertainties surrounding our ability to raise such funding, raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In order for us to continue operations beyond the next twelve months and be able to discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business, we must sell our products directly to end-users and through distributors; establish profitable operations through increased sales and a reduction of operating expenses; and potentially raise additional funds, principally through the additional sales of our securities or debt financings to meet our working capital needs. We intend to increase sales by increasing our product offerings, expanding our direct sales force and expanding our distributor relationships both domestically and internationally. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase sales, reduce expenses or obtain additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to us. If we are unable to increase sales, reduce expenses or raise sufficient additional capital we may be unable to continue to fund our operations, develop our products or realize value from our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business. These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets, and might realize significantly less than the values at which they are carried on our financial statements, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment in our common stock. Continued global economic uncertainty and volatility in financial markets may continue to adversely affect our liquidity, operating results, and financial condition. Our business is highly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions as a seller of capital equipment to end users in dental professional practices. Financial markets inside the United States and internationally have experienced extreme disruption in recent times, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, and declining valuations of investments. These disruptions are likely to have an ongoing adverse effect on the world economy. A continuing economic downturn and financial market disruptions may: reduce demand for our products and services, increase order cancellations and result in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies; increase the difficulty of collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories; increase price competition in our served markets; and result in supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products. We have experienced net losses for each of the past three years and we may experience additional losses and have difficulty achieving profitability in the future. We had an accumulated deficit of approximately $123.8 million at December 31, 2013. We recorded net losses of approximately $11.5 million, $3.1 million, and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. In order to achieve profitability, we must control our costs and increase net revenue through new sales. Failure to increase our net revenue and decrease our costs could cause our stock price to decline. 21 Our business is capital intensive and the failure to obtain capital could require that we curtail capital expenditures. To remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in the development of our products, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the expansion of our operating and management infrastructure as we increase sales domestically and internationally. If cash generated from our operations is insufficient to fund such growth, we may be required to raise additional funds through further debt or equity financings, which may dilute the percentage ownership of existing holders of common stock and which may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock or may be issued at a discount to the market price of our common stock thereby resulting in dilution to our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through debt financing, we may be subject to debt covenants which could place limitations on our operations. We may not be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms, or at all, or we may use capital more rapidly than anticipated. If we cannot raise the required capital when needed, we may not be able to satisfy the demands of existing and prospective customers and may lose revenue and market share. The following factors, among others, could affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all: our results of operations; general economic conditions and conditions in the dental or medical device industries; the perception of our business in the capital markets; our ratio of debt to equity; our financial condition; our business prospects; and interest rates. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, we may have to curtail our capital expenditures. Any curtailment of our capital expenditures could result in a reduction in net revenue, reduced quality of our products, increased manufacturing costs for our products, harm to our reputation, reduced manufacturing efficiencies or other harm to our business. Our distributors may cancel, reduce or delay orders of our products, any of which could reduce our revenue. We rely on exclusive and non-exclusive independent distributors for a portion of our sales in North America and a majority of our sales in countries outside of the United States and Canada. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 revenue from distributors accounted for approximately 30%, 23%, and 42% of our total net revenue, respectively. Our ability to maintain or increase our revenue will depend in large part on our success in developing and maintaining relationships with our current distributors and developing relationships with new distributors. Our distributors have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources they apply to the sale of our products. Our distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations and, regardless of the resources they commit, they may not be successful. From time to time, we may face competition or pricing pressure from one or more of our non-exclusive distributors in certain geographic areas where those distributors are selling inventory to the same customer base as us. Additionally, most of our distributor agreements can be terminated with limited notice, and we may not be able to replace any terminating distributor in a timely manner or on terms agreeable to us, if at all. If we are not able to maintain our distribution network, if our distribution network is not successful in marketing and selling our products, or if we experience a significant reduction in, cancellation, or change in the size and timing of orders from our distributors, our revenues could decline significantly. Dentists and patients have been hesitant in adopting laser technologies and our inability to overcome this hesitancy could limit the market acceptance of our products and market share. Our dental laser systems represent relatively new technologies in the dental market. Currently, only a small percentage of dentists use lasers to perform dental procedures. Our future success will depend on our ability to increase demand for our products by demonstrating the potential performance advantages of our laser systems over traditional methods of treatment and over competitive laser systems to a broad spectrum of dentists and patients. Historically, we have experienced long sales cycles because dentists have been, and may continue to be, slow to adopt new technologies on a widespread basis. As a result, we generally are required to invest a significant amount of time and resources to educate dentists about the benefits of our products in comparison to competing products and technologies before completing a sale, if any. 22 Factors that may inhibit adoption of laser technologies by dentists include cost and concerns about the safety, efficacy and reliability of lasers. In order to invest in a WaterLase system, a dentist generally needs to invest time to understand the technology, consider how patients may respond to the new technology, assess the financial impact the investment may have on the dentist’s practice and become comfortable performing procedures with our products. Absent an immediate competitive motivation, a dentist may not feel compelled to invest the time required to learn about the potential benefits of using a laser system. Dentists may not accept or adopt our products until they see additional clinical evidence supporting the safety and efficiency of our products or recommendations supporting our laser systems by influential dental practitioners. In addition, economic pressure, caused, for example, by an economic slowdown, changes in healthcare reimbursement or by competitive factors in a specific market, may make dentists reluctant to purchase substantial capital equipment or invest in new technologies. Patient acceptance will depend on the recommendations of dentists and specialists, as well as other factors, including without limitation, the relative effectiveness, safety, reliability and comfort of our systems as compared to other instruments and methods for performing dental procedures. The failure of dental lasers to achieve broad market acceptance would limit sales of our products and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Any failure in our efforts to train dental practitioners could reduce the market acceptance of WaterLase Dentistry and reduce our revenues. There is a learning process involved for dental practitioners to become proficient users of our laser systems. It is critical to the success of our sales efforts to adequately train a sufficient number of dental practitioners. Following completion of training, we rely on the trained dental practitioners to advocate the benefits of our products in the broader marketplace. Convincing dental practitioners to dedicate the time and energy necessary for adequate training is challenging, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts. If dental practitioners are not properly trained, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products, or may be less likely to appreciate our laser systems. This may also result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes, patient injury, negative publicity, or lawsuits against us, any of which could negatively affect our reputation and sales of our laser systems. If future data proves to be inconsistent with our clinical results or if competitors’ products present more favorable results our revenues may decline. If new studies or comparative studies generate results that are not as favorable as our clinical results, our revenues may decline. Additionally, if future studies indicate that our competitors’ products are more effective or safer than ours, our revenues may decline. Furthermore, physicians may choose not to purchase our laser systems until they receive additional published long-term clinical evidence and recommendations from prominent physicians that indicate our laser systems are effective for dental applications. We face competition from other companies, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize enhanced or new products that remain competitive with products or alternative technologies developed by others, we could lose revenue opportunities and customers and our ability to grow our business would be impaired. A number of competitors have substantially greater capital resources, larger customer bases, larger technical, sales and marketing forces and have established stronger reputations with target customers than ours. We compete with a number of domestic and foreign companies that market traditional dental products, such as dental drills, as well as companies that market laser technologies in the dental and medical markets. The marketplace is highly fragmented and very competitive. We expect that the rapid technological changes occurring in the healthcare industry may lead to the entry of new competitors, particularly if dental and medical lasers gain increasing market acceptance. If we do not compete successfully, our revenue and market share may decline. Our long-term success depends upon our ability to (i) distinguish our products through improving our product performance and pricing, protecting our intellectual property, continuously improving our customer support, accurately timing the introduction of new products, and developing sustainable distribution channels worldwide; and (ii) develop and successful commercialize new products, new or improved technologies, and additional applications for our existing dental and medical lasers. 23 If our customers cannot obtain third party reimbursement for their use of our products, they may be less inclined to purchase our products. Our products are generally purchased by dental or medical professionals who have various billing practices and patient mixes. Such practices range from primarily private pay to those who rely heavily on third party payors, such as private insurance or government programs. In the United States, third party payors review and frequently challenge the prices charged for medical services. In many foreign countries, the prices for dental services are predetermined through government regulation. Payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that the procedure was not medically necessary or that the device used in the procedure was investigational. We believe that most of the procedures being performed with our current products generally are reimbursable, with the exception of cosmetic applications, such as teeth whitening. For the portion of dentists who rely heavily on third party reimbursement, the inability to obtain reimbursement for services using our products could deter them from purchasing or using our products. We cannot predict the effect of future healthcare reforms or changes in financing for health and dental plans. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on the ability of a dental or medical professional to generate a return on investment using our current or future products. Such changes could act as disincentives for capital investments by dental and medical professionals and could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards may be limited. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) of 1986 generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in its stock ownership. In 2006, we completed an analysis to determine the applicability of the annual limitations imposed by IRC Section 382 caused by previous changes in our stock ownership and determined that such limitations should not be significant. Based on our analysis, we believe that, as of December 31, 2013, approximately $77.9 million of net operating loss carryforwards were available to us for federal income tax purposes. A detailed analysis will be required at the time we begin utilization of any net operating losses to determine if there is an IRC Section 382 limitation. In addition, any ownership changes qualifying under IRC Section 382, including changes resulting from or affected by public offerings or stock repurchase plans, may adversely affect our ability to use our remaining net operating loss carryforwards. If we lose our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards, any income we generate will be subject to tax earlier than it would be if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards, resulting in lower profits. Risks Related to Our Intellectual PropertyIf the patents that we own or license, or our other intellectual property rights, do not adequately protect our technologies, we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and technology, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the intellectual property of others. We rely on patents to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. We currently possess a number of issued patents and patent applications with respect to our products and technology; however, we cannot assure that any additional patents will be issued, that the scope of any patent protection will be effective in helping us address our competition, or that any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged. It is also possible that our competitors may independently develop similar or more desirable products, duplicate our products, or design products that circumvent our patents. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. In addition, there have been recent changes in patent laws and rules of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and there may be future proposed changes which, if enacted, may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitive position and financial condition may be adversely affected. If third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling certain products. We face substantial uncertainty regarding the impact that other parties’ intellectual property positions will have on the markets for dental and other medical lasers. The medical technology industry has in the past been characterized by a substantial amount of litigation and related administrative proceedings regarding patents and intellectual property rights. From time to time, we have received, and expect to continue to receive, notices of claims of infringement, misappropriation, or misuse of other parties’ proprietary rights. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. We may not prevail in any future intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in litigation. Any claims, with or without merit, may be time-consuming and distracting to management, result in costly litigation, or cause product shipment delays. Adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liability and could result in the loss of proprietary rights. A successful lawsuit against us could also force us to cease selling or redesign products that incorporate the infringed intellectual property. Additionally, we could be required to seek a license from the holder of the intellectual property to use the infringed technology, and it is possible that we may not be able to obtain a license on acceptable terms, or at all. Any of the foregoing adverse events could seriously affect our business. 24 Risks Related to Our Regulatory Environment Changes in government regulation or the inability to obtain or maintain necessary government approvals could harm our business. Our products are subject to extensive government regulation, both in the United States and in other countries. To clinically test, manufacture and market products for human use, we must comply with regulations and safety standards set by the FDA and comparable state and foreign agencies. Regulations adopted by the FDA are wide ranging and govern, among other things, product design, development, manufacture and control testing, labeling control, storage, advertising, and sales. Generally, products must meet regulatory standards as safe and effective for their intended use before being marketed for human applications. The clearance process is expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements of the FDA can result in an enforcement action which may include a variety of sanctions, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of our products, operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production and criminal prosecution. The failure to receive or maintain requisite approvals for the use of our products or processes, or significant delays in obtaining such approvals, could prevent us from developing, manufacturing, and marketing products and services necessary for us to remain competitive. Should we develop new products and applications or make any significant modifications to our existing products or labeling, we will need to obtain additional regulatory clearances or approvals to market such products. Any modification that could significantly affect a product’s safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a change in its intended use, will require a new FDA 510(k) clearance, or could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. If 510(k) clearance is denied and a pre-market approval application is required, we could be required to submit substantially more data, may be required to conduct human clinical testing and would very likely be subject to a significantly longer review period. Products sold in international markets are also subject to the regulatory requirements of each respective country or region. The regulations of the European Union require that a device have a CE Mark, indicating conformance with European Union laws and regulations before it can be sold in that market. The regulatory international review process varies from country to country. We rely on our distributors and sales representatives in the foreign countries in which we market our products to comply with the regulatory laws of such countries. Failure to comply with the laws of such countries could have a material adverse effect on our operations and, at the very least, could prevent us from continuing to sell products in such countries. In addition, unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new requirements could impose significant costs and burdens on us, which could increase our operating expenses and harm our financial condition. Changes in the health care industry in the U.S. and elsewhere could adversely affect the demand for our products as well as the way in which we conduct our business. Significantly, President Obama signed health care reform legislation into law that will require most individuals to have health insurance, establish new regulations on health plans, and create insurance pooling mechanisms and other expanded public health care measures. In general, an expansion in government’s role in the U.S. health care industry may lower reimbursements for our products or the procedures for which our products are used, reduce demand for innovative products, reduce volumes for dental and medical procedures, and adversely affect our business and results of operations, possibly materially. In addition, as a result of the focus on health care reform, there is risk that Congress may implement changes in laws and regulations governing health care service providers, including measures to control costs, or reductions in reimbursement levels. We may be subject to or otherwise affected by federal and state health care laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, and could face penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such regulations, we could face substantial penalties. We are directly or indirectly, through our customers, subject to extensive regulation by both the federal government and the states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business. The laws that directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate our business include, but are not limited to, the following: the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which regulates the design, testing, manufacture, labeling, marketing, distribution, and sale of prescription drugs and medical devices; state food and drug laws; the federal Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either; the referral of an individual, or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid Programs; 25 Medicare laws and regulations that prescribe the requirements for coverage and payment, including the amount of such payment, and laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid; the federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, which, in the absence of a statutory or regulatory exception, prohibits the referral of Medicare patients by a physician to an entity for the provision of designated healthcare services, if the physician or a member of the physician’s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship, including an ownership interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, the entity and also prohibits that entity from submitting a bill to a federal payor for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral; federal provisions of HIPAA that established federal crimes for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services; federal and state false claims laws that prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third-party payers that are false or fraudulent; state laws that prohibit the practice of medicine by non-physicians and fee-splitting arrangements between physicians and non-physicians, as well as state law equivalents to the Anti-Kickback Law and the Stark Law, which may not be limited to government reimbursed items; and the Federal Trade Commission Act and similar laws regulating advertising and consumer protection. If our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or the other governmental regulations to which we or our customers are subject, we may be subject to the applicable penalty associated with the violation, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If we are required to obtain permits or licensure under these laws that we do not already possess, we may become subject to substantial additional regulation or incur significant expense. Any penalties, damages, fines, or curtailment or restructuring of our operations would adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by applicable regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations and additional legal or regulatory change. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation. Product sales or introductions may be delayed or canceled as a result of the FDA regulatory process which could cause our sales or profitability to decline. The process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and clearances to market a medical device from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities abroad can be costly and time consuming, and we cannot assure you that such approvals and clearances will be granted. Pursuant to FDA regulations, unless exempt, the FDA permits commercial distribution of a new medical device only after the device has received 510(k) clearance or is the subject of an approved pre-market approval application. The FDA will clear marketing of a medical device through the 510(k) process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to other 510(k)-cleared products. The pre-market approval application process is more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) process, and must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies, and human clinical trials. Because we cannot assure you that any new products, or any product enhancements, that we develop will be subject to the shorter 510(k) clearance process, significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancement may occur. We cannot assure you that the FDA will not require a new product or product enhancement to go through the lengthy and expensive pre-market approval application process. Delays in obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals may: delay or eliminate commercialization of products we develop; require us to perform costly procedures; diminish any competitive advantages that we may attain; and reduce our ability to collect revenues or royalties. Although we have obtained 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market our dental laser systems, we cannot assure you that the clearance of these systems will not be withdrawn or that we will not be required to obtain new clearances or approvals for modifications or improvements to our products. 26 Our products are subject to recall even after receiving FDA clearance or approval; any recalls would harm our reputation, business and financial results. The FDA and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. A government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, or design defects, including defects in labeling. Any recall would divert management’s attention and financial resources and harm our reputation with customers. Any recall involving our laser systems would be particularly harmful to our business and financial results because the laser systems compose such an important part of our portfolio of products. Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Under the Affordable Care Act, we are subject to a 2.3% excise tax payable semi-monthly on U.S. revenues of certain medical devices beginning in January 2013. A significant portion of our revenue is generated from medical devices sold in the U.S. and these taxes are imposed on us whether or not we earn a profit. The Affordable Care Act also contains reporting requirements of certain payments made by us to medical and dental practitioners and teaching hospitals (the “Physician Payment Sunshine Act”) which will be published on a publicly available website annually beginning in 2014. This requirement is expected to increase the administrative costs for both manufacturers and health care providers and may result in a decline in our collaborative efforts. A decline in these collaborations may adversely affect advances in our laser technology or may reduce attendance at events at which our technology is demonstrated, which could reduce demand for our products and lead to sales price pressures. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act may adversely impact third-party reimbursements received by our end-user customers, which may reduce demand for our products. There may be other provisions in the law that could adversely affect our business, and we cannot predict with any certainty the full impact this legislation may have on our business. Risks Related to Our Business and Operations Any failure to significantly expand sales of our products with our distribution partners will negatively impact our business. We currently handle a significant portion of the marketing, distribution, and sales of our products. We also utilize our relationships with domestic and international distributors to market, distribute, and sell our products. We face significant challenges and risks in expanding, training, managing, and retaining our sales and marketing teams, including managing geographically dispersed operations. We rely on independent distributors to market and sell our products in a number of countries outside of the United States. These distributors may not commit the necessary resources to effectively market and sell our products, and they may terminate their relationships with us at any time with limited notice. If we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capabilities domestically and internationally, or if the relationship with our distribution partners does not produce the expected results, we may not be able to effectively commercialize our products, which could harm our business and cause the price of our common stock to decline. We may incur problems in manufacturing our products which may harm our business. In order to grow our business, we must expand our manufacturing capabilities to produce the systems and accessories necessary to meet any demand we may experience. We may encounter difficulties in increasing the production of our products, including problems involving production capacity and yields, quality control and assurance, component supply, and shortages of qualified personnel. In addition, before we can begin commercial manufacture of our products, we must ensure our manufacturing facilities, processes, and quality systems, and the manufacture of our laser systems comply with FDA regulations governing facility compliance, quality control, and documentation policies and procedures. In addition, our manufacturing facilities are continuously subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, as well as various state agencies and foreign regulatory agencies. From time to time, we may expend significant resources in obtaining, maintaining, and remedying our compliance with these requirements. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA’s QSR and other regulatory requirements. We have experienced quality issues with components of our products supplied by third parties. If we do not succeed in manufacturing our products on a timely basis with acceptable manufacturing costs, while at the same time maintaining good quality control and complying with applicable regulatory requirements, our business could be harmed. 27 Components used in our products are complex in design and any defects may not be discovered prior to shipment to customers. These defects could result in warranty obligations which would increase our cost and may negatively affect our operating results and our reputation. In manufacturing our products, we depend upon third parties for the supply of various components. Many of these components require a significant degree of technical expertise to design and produce. If we fail to adequately design, or if our suppliers fail to produce components to specification, or if the suppliers, or we, use defective materials or workmanship in the manufacturing process, the reliability and performance of our products will be compromised. We have experienced such non-compliance with manufacturing specifications in the past and may continue to experience such non-compliance in the future, which could lead to higher costs and reduced gross margins. Our products may contain defects that cannot be repaired easily and inexpensively, and we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future some or all of the following: loss of customer orders and delay in order fulfillment; damage to our brand reputation; increased cost of our warranty program due to product repair or replacement; inability to attract new customers; diversion of resources from our manufacturing and research and development departments into our service department; and legal action. The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing could materially harm our business. Product liability claims against us could be costly and could harm our reputation. The sale of dental and medical devices involves the risk of product liability claims against us. Claims could exceed our product liability insurance coverage limits. Our insurance policies are subject to various standard coverage exclusions, including damage to the product itself, losses from recall of our product, and losses covered by other forms of insurance such as workers compensation. We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully defend any claims against us, nor can we be certain that our insurance will cover all liabilities resulting from such claims. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, any product liability claim brought against us could result in harm to our reputation, decreased demand for our products, costs related to litigation, product recalls, loss of revenue, an increase in our product liability insurance rates, or the inability to secure coverage in the future, and may cause our business to suffer. Our suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient amount of materials and components or materials and components of adequate quality. We frequently do not use written supply contracts with our key suppliers; instead, we purchase certain materials and components included in our products from a limited group of suppliers using purchase orders. Our business depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of materials and components in acceptable quality and quantities from our suppliers. Certain components of our products, particularly specialized components used in our lasers, are currently available only from a single source or limited sources. For example, the crystal, fiber, and hand pieces used in our WaterLase systems are each supplied by a separate single supplier. Our dependence on single-source suppliers involves several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality, and delivery schedules. If any one or more of our single-source suppliers cease to provide us with sufficient quantities of our components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, or cease to manufacture components of acceptable quality, we would have to seek alternative sources of manufacturing. We could incur delays while we locate and engage alternative qualified suppliers and we might be unable to engage acceptable alternative suppliers on favorable terms. Any such disruption or increased expenses could harm our business efforts and adversely affect our ability to generate sales. Our reliance on these outside manufacturers and suppliers also subjects us to other risks that could harm our business, including: we may not be able to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms; we may have difficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers for the various components in our laser systems; switching components may require product redesign and submission to the FDA of a 510(k) application, which could significantly delay production; our suppliers manufacture products for a range of customers, and fluctuations in demand for the products those suppliers manufacture for others may affect their ability to deliver components for us in a timely manner; and our suppliers may encounter financial hardships, be acquired, or experience other business events unrelated to our demand for components, which could inhibit or prevent their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements. 28 Any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials, or our inability to obtain components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to cancel orders or switch to competitive procedures. We are currently in the process of identifying and qualifying alternate source suppliers for our key components. There can be no assurance, however, that we will successfully identify and qualify an alternate source supplier for any of our key components or that we could enter into an agreement with any such alternate source supplier on terms acceptable to us. Rapidly changing standards and competing technologies could harm demand for our products or result in significant additional costs. The markets in which our products compete are subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in the regulatory environment, and frequent introductions of new devices and evolving dental and surgical techniques. Competing products may emerge which could render our products uncompetitive or obsolete. The process of developing new medical devices is inherently complex and requires regulatory approvals or clearances that can be expensive, time consuming, and uncertain. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, identify new and innovative applications of our technology, or be financially or otherwise capable of completing the research and development required to bring new products to market in a timely manner. An inability to expand our product offerings or the application of our technology could limit our growth. In addition, we may incur higher manufacturing costs if manufacturing processes or standards change, and we may need to replace, modify, design, or build and install equipment, all of which would require additional capital expenditures. Failure to effectively manage and implement our growth strategies could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our growth strategy includes adding new vendors and products to further expand our offerings within existing product markets and developing new product offerings leveraging our patented laser technologies and strategic relationships for entry into new product markets. Expansion of our existing product markets and entry into new product markets divert the use of our resources and systems, require additional resources that might not be available (or available on acceptable terms), require additional country-specific regulatory approvals, result in new or increasing competition, may require longer implementation times or greater start-up expenditures than anticipated, and may otherwise fail to achieve the desired results in a timely fashion, if at all. These efforts may also require that we successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively, and manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time. If we are unable to increase our sales and earnings by expanding our product offerings in a cost effective manner, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences, or if we fail to produce viable technologies, then our revenues may not grow, which would adversely affect our profitability. In addition, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement, which could also adversely affect our profitability.Our failure to effectively manage our growth could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, our growth may increase our working capital requirements and as a result, we may require additional equity or debt financing. Such financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all.We have significant international sales and are subject to risks associated with operating in international markets. International sales comprise a significant portion of our net revenue and we intend to continue to pursue and expand our international business activities. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, international sales accounted for approximately 37%, 29%, and 33% of our net revenue, respectively. Political and economic conditions outside the United States could make it difficult for us to increase our international revenue or to operate abroad. International operations are subject to many inherent risks, including among others: adverse changes in tariffs and trade restrictions; political, social, and economic instability and increased security concerns; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; longer collection periods and difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities; exposure to different legal standards; transportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels; reduced protection for our intellectual property in some countries; 29 difficulties in obtaining domestic and foreign export, import, and other governmental approvals, permits, and licenses, and compliance with foreign laws; the imposition of governmental controls; unexpected changes in regulatory or certification requirements; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and potentially adverse tax consequences and the complexities of foreign value-added tax systems. We believe that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue, and we intend to expand our international operations further. In international markets where our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, an increase in the relative value of the dollar against the currency in such markets could indirectly increase the price of our products in those markets and result in a decrease in sales. We do not currently engage in any transactions as a hedge against risks of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations, although we may consider doing so in the future. Risks generally associated with our information systems could adversely affect our results of operations.We rely on information systems (“IS”) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to, among other things:facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items through numerous distributors;receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis; accurately bill and collect from thousands of customers;process payments to suppliers; andprovide technical support to our customers.A cyber-attack that bypasses our IS security causing an IS security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IS and/or the loss of business information, which could adversely affect our business. These risks may include, among others, the following:future results could be adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property;operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of IS and subsequent clean-up and mitigation activities; andliability for a breach of personal financial and health information belonging to our customers and their patients.Our results of operations could be adversely affected if our IS are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, incur cyber-attacks or fail for any extended period of time.Fluctuations in our revenue and operating results on a quarterly and annual basis could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Our revenue and operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Historically, we have experienced fluctuations in revenue from quarter to quarter due to seasonality. Revenue in the first quarter typically is lower than average and revenue in the fourth quarter typically is stronger than average due to the buying patterns of dental professionals. We believe that this trend exists because a significant number of dentists purchase their capital equipment towards the end of the calendar year in order to maximize their practice earnings while seeking to minimize their taxes. This can be accomplished by utilizing certain tax incentives, such as accelerated depreciation methods for purchasing capital equipment, as part of their year-end tax planning. In addition, revenue in the third quarter may be affected by vacation patterns which can cause revenue to be flat or lower than in the second quarter of the year. Our historical seasonal fluctuations may also be impacted by sales procedures employed by large dental distributors that encourage end-of-quarter and end-of-year buying in our industry. If our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors, analysts, or our previously stated financial guidance, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Other factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenue and operating results include the following: variation in demand for our products, including seasonality; our ability to research, develop, market, and sell new products and product enhancements in a timely manner; our ability to control costs; our ability to control quality issues with our products; 30 regulatory actions that impact our manufacturing processes; the size, timing, rescheduling, or cancellation of orders from distributors; the introduction of new products by competitors; the length of and fluctuations in sales cycles; the availability and reliability of components used to manufacture our products; changes in our pricing policies or those of our suppliers and competitors, as well as increased price competition in general; legal expenses, particularly related to litigation matters; general economic conditions including the availability of credit for our existing and potential customer base to finance purchases; the mix of our domestic and international sales and the risks and uncertainties associated with international business; costs associated with any future acquisitions of technologies and businesses; limitations on our ability to use net operating loss carry-forwards under the provisions of IRC Section 382 and similar state laws; developments concerning the protection of our intellectual property rights; catastrophic events such as hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes, which can affect our ability to advertise, sell, and distribute our products, including through national conferences held in regions in which these disasters strike; and global economic, political, and social events, including international conflicts and acts of terrorism. The expenses we incur are based, in large part, on our expectations regarding future net revenue. Since many of our costs are fixed in the short term, we may be unable to reduce expenses quickly enough to avoid losses if we experience a decrease in net revenue. Accordingly, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance. The recent financial crisis and general slowdown of the economy may adversely affect the credit availability and liquidity of our customers and suppliers. The credit availability and liquidity of our customers and suppliers may be materially affected by the ongoing credit crisis. If our suppliers experience credit or liquidity problems, important sources of raw materials or manufactured goods may be affected. We currently sell our products primarily to dentists in general practice. These dentists often purchase our products with funds they secure through various financing arrangements with third party financial institutions, including credit facilities and short-term loans. If interest rates increase or the availability of credit is otherwise negatively impacted by market conditions, these financing arrangements will be more expensive to our dental customers, which would effectively increase the overall cost of owning our products for our customers and, thereby, may decrease demand for our products. The recent recession made, and may continue to make, such funding less readily available. Any reduction in the sales of our products would cause our business to suffer. We are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business, including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, commercial disputes, competition, sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, and insurance coverage. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive as well a compensatory damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. In addition, developments in legal proceedings in any given period may require us to record loss contingency estimates in our financial statements, which could adversely affect our results of operations in any period. 31 Our operations are consolidated primarily in one facility. A disruption at this facility could result in a prolonged interruption of our business and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. Substantially all of our administrative operations and our manufacturing operations are located at our facility in Irvine, California, which is near known earthquake fault zones. We have taken precautions to safeguard our facilities including disaster recovery planning and off-site backup of computer data; however, a natural disaster such as an earthquake, fire, or flood, could seriously harm our business, adversely affect our operations, and damage our reputation with customers. Additionally, labor disputes, maintenance requirements, power outages, equipment failures, civil unrest, or terrorist attacks affecting our Irvine, California facility may materially and adversely affect our operating results. Our business interruption insurance coverage may not cover all or any of our losses from natural disasters or other disruptions. If we lose the services of our key personnel, or if we are unable to attract other key personnel, we may not be able to manage our operations or meet our growth objectives. We are highly dependent on our senior management, especially Federico Pignatelli, our Chief Executive Officer, Fred Furry, our Chief Financial Officer, and other key employees. We are also heavily dependent on our engineers, sales and marketing personnel, and other highly skilled technical personnel. Our success will depend on our ability to retain our current management, engineers, marketing and sales team, and other technical personnel and to attract and retain qualified like personnel in the future. Competition for senior management, engineers, marketing and sales personnel, and other specialized technicians is intense and we may not be able to retain our personnel. The loss of the services of members of our key personnel could prevent the implementation and completion of our objectives, including the development and introduction of our products. In general, our officers may terminate their employment at any time without notice for any reason. Existing or future acquisitions of businesses could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations if we fail to integrate the acquired businesses successfully into our existing operations or if we discover previously undisclosed liabilities. Successful acquisitions depend upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete, and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financing. We expect to continue to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other technologies, products and businesses that could enhance our capabilities, complement our current products, or expand the breadth of our markets or customer base. We have limited experience in acquiring other businesses and technologies. Even if we complete acquisitions, we may experience: difficulties in integrating any acquired companies, personnel, products, and other assets into our existing business; delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company, product, or other assets; diversion of our management’s time and attention from other business concerns; limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter; higher costs of integration than we anticipated; and Difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these acquisitions. In addition, an acquisition could materially impair our operating results by causing us to incur debt or requiring us to amortize expenses and acquired assets. We may also discover deficiencies in internal controls, data adequacy and integrity, product quality, regulatory compliance, and product liabilities that we did not uncover prior to our acquisition of such businesses, which could result in us becoming subject to penalties or other liabilities. Any difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses or unexpected penalties or liabilities in connection with such businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and result of operations.If we fail to comply with the reporting obligations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, or if we fail to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, our business, results of operations and financial condition and investors’ confidence in us could be materially and adversely affected. As a public company, we are required to comply with the periodic reporting obligations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, including preparing annual reports, quarterly reports, and current reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner and meet our reporting obligations in their entirety could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, expose us to lawsuits, and restrict our ability to access financing on favorable terms, or at all. 32 Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act added Section 13(p) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which requires us to disclose annually whether any conflict minerals, including tantalum, tin, gold, and tungsten, that are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by us originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. Components of our products containing these minerals are sourced through various vendors who may have complex supply chains which may change from time to time due to the influence of availability, pricing, or other factors in their purchasing decisions. We are required to conduct a good faith and reasonable effort to determine the source of these materials; however, there can be no assurance that members in the supply chain will be willing or able to provide this information or further identify their sources of supply or notify us timely of changes. We must comply with the final rule for the calendar year beginning January 1, 2013 with the first reports due May 31, 2014. In addition, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes Oxley Act”), we are required to evaluate and provide a management report of our systems of internal control over financial reporting. During the course of the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify areas requiring improvement and may be required to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review. This could result in significant delays and costs to us and require us to divert substantial resources, including management time, from other activities. In addition, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. Any failure to maintain the requirements of Section 404 on a timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business, negatively impact the trading price of our stock, and adversely affect investors’ confidence in our company and our ability to access capital markets for financing. Climate change initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business. Our manufacturing processes require that we purchase significant quantities of energy from third parties, which results in the generation of greenhouse gases, either directly on-site or indirectly at electric utilities. Both domestic and international legislation to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and establishing a price on carbon could create increases in energy costs and price volatility. Considerable international attention is now focused on development of an international policy framework to address climate change. Proposed and existing legislative efforts to control or limit greenhouse gas emissions could affect our energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from sources that generate greenhouse gas emissions. If our suppliers are unable to obtain energy at a reasonable cost in the future, the cost of our raw materials may be negatively impacted which could result in increased manufacturing costs. Risks Related to Our Stock Our stock price may be volatile, and your investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value. There has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, which is often unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our stock. The market price and volume of our common stock may fluctuate, and in the past has fluctuated, more dramatically than the stock market in general. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them due to fluctuations in the market price of our stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects and other factors. Some specific factors, in addition to the other risk factors identified above, that may have a significant effect on our stock market price, many of which we cannot control. These include but are not limited to: actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects; our announcements or our competitors’ announcements of new products; the public’s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements, and our filings with the SEC; strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles; changes in our growth rates or our competitors’ growth rates; developments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors; our inability to raise additional capital as needed; concerns or allegations as to the safety or efficacy of our products; changes in financial markets or general economic conditions; 33 sales of stock by us or members of our management team, our Board, or certain institutional stockholders; and changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally. You could experience substantial dilution of your investment as a result of subsequent exercises of our outstanding convertible securities, future sales of our equity, or the future grant of equity by us. You could experience substantial dilution of your investment as a result of subsequent exercises of outstanding options and warrants issued as incentive compensation for services performed by employees, directors, consultants, and others, future sales of our equity, or the grant of future equity awarded by us. As of December 31, 2013, an aggregate of 7,750,000 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plan, 4,441,000 of which were subject to options outstanding as of that date at a weighted average exercise price of $3.51 per share. In addition, as of December 31, 2013, 1,598,000 shares of our common stock were subject to warrants at a weighted average exercise price of $5.66 per share. Of the 4,441,000 outstanding stock options at December 31, 2013, 2,688,000 stock options were exercisable. To the extent that outstanding options are exercised, our existing stockholders may incur dilution. We rely heavily on equity awards to motivate current employees and to attract new employees. The grant of future equity awards by us to our employees and other service providers may further dilute our stockholders. We also expect to issue additional shares of our equity securities to raise capital. During 2013, we sold approximately 2.7 million shares of common stock through a registered direct offering for gross proceeds totaling approximately $5.0 million, and sold 340,000 shares of common stock through an unregistered direct offering for gross proceed totaling approximately $612,000. During 2011, we sold approximately 2.5 million shares of common stock through a controlled equity offering for gross proceeds totaling approximately $9.3 million and we also sold an aggregate of 1.6 million shares in a private placement for gross proceeds totaling approximately $9 million. Our Board declared a 0.5% stock dividend in each of the four quarters in 2013 and 2012 and a 1% stock dividend in each of the four quarters in 2011 which resulted in the issuance of 667,342 shares, 634,162 shares, and 1,165,715 shares, respectively. Our corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company and reduce the market price of our stock. Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board to issue up to 500,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock. As a result, without further stockholder approval, the Board has the authority to attach special rights, including voting and dividend rights, to this preferred stock. With these rights, preferred stockholders could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. We are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under these provisions, if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder,” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval, which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change in control of us. An “interested stockholder” generally means (subject to certain exceptions as described in the Delaware General Corporation Law) someone owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years. In addition, we have adopted a stockholder rights plan. Under the stockholder rights plan, if any party acquires 20% or more, as amended February 4, 2014, of our outstanding common stock while the stockholder rights plan remains in place, subject to a number of exceptions set forth in the plan, the holders of these rights, other than the party acquiring the 20% position, will be able to purchase shares of our common stock, or other securities or assets, at a discounted price, causing substantial dilution to the party acquiring the 20% position. Following the acquisition of 20% or more of our stock by any person, without a redemption of the rights or a termination of the stockholder rights plan by the Board, if we are acquired by or merged with any other entity, holders of these rights, other than the party acquiring the 20% position, will also be able to purchase shares of common stock of the acquiring or surviving entity if the stockholder rights plan continues to remain in place. Our stockholder rights plan could discourage a takeover attempt and make an unsolicited takeover of our company more difficult. As a result, without the approval of our Board, you may not have the opportunity to sell your shares to a potential acquirer of us at a premium over prevailing market prices. This could reduce the market price of our stock. 34 We may elect to not declare cash dividends on our stock, or may elect to only pay dividends on an infrequent or irregular basis, and any return on your investment may be limited to the value of our stock. Our Board may from time to time declare, and we may pay, cash dividends on our outstanding shares of common stock in the manner and upon the terms and conditions provided by law. However, we may elect to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business, rather than paying cash dividends on our stock. Any payment of cash dividends on our stock will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, business prospects, contractual restrictions, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. In the event our Board declares any cash dividends, there is no assurance with respect to the amount, timing, or frequency of any such dividends. We could be negatively affected as a result of a proxy fight and related litigation.In March 2014, we received from Oracle Partners, L.P., Oracle Institutional Partners, L.P., Oracle Ten Fund Master, L.P., Oracle Associates, LLC, Oracle Investment, Inc., and Larry N. Feinberg (collectively “Oracle”), which reports that it owns 16% of our common stock, declared its intention to change the composition of our Board. Oracle nominated a majority opposition slate of individuals for election to replace our Board at the 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and has stated its dissatisfaction with our performance and senior management. Oracle has filed a lawsuit against our Board with respect to the present composition of our Board and the operation of the Company until the Court determines the Board composition, see Item 3 — “Legal Proceedings.” A proxy contest and related litigation could negatively affect us because:·Responding to proxy contests, litigation, and other actions by dissident shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees;·Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may divert the attention of, damage morale, and create instability among our business partners, management, and employees, and adversely impact our existing and potential strategic and operational relationships and opportunities;·We may experience difficulties in hiring, retaining, and motivating personnel during the resulting uncertain and turbulent times;·If individuals are elected to our Board with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our current business plan which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition;·Increases in legal fees, administrative, and associated costs incurred in connection with responding to a proxy contest and related litigation could be substantial; and·A proxy contest, or the threat of one, could cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation. Risks Related to Our Revolving Credit Facilities The terms of our revolving credit facilities impose financial and operating restrictions on us and failure to comply may have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, and financial position. Our revolving credit facilities contain a number of negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities. These covenants limit or restrict, among other things, our ability to: incur additional indebtedness and grant liens on assets; make certain investments and restricted payments (including the ability to pay cash dividends and repurchase stock); undertake certain acquisitions or sell certain assets; enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and replace our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, unless our Board determines, in good faith, exigent circumstances require their prompt replacement. These limitations and restrictions may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests. Further, the revolving credit facilities subject us to various reporting covenants and financial covenants, including requirements to maintain certain levels of debt ratios and minimum earnings before income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”). The lockbox arrangements under the revolving bank facilities provide that substantially all of the income generated is deposited directly into lockbox accounts and then swept into cash management accounts for the benefit of the bank. Cash is disbursed to us only after payment of the applicable debt service and principal. 35 Our ability to borrow under the revolving bank facilities is subject to compliance with the negative and financial covenants. If we breach any of the covenants in our revolving credit facilities, we may be in default under our revolving credit facilities. If we default, our borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, plus accrued interest and other fees, could be declared due and payable. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
