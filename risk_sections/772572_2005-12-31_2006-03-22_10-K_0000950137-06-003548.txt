Item 1A. Risk factors. Our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results. For a discussion of other matters which may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, see the further discussions in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2005 Annual Report. We depend on revenues from a small number of significant customers. Any loss, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. Our top two customers accounted for 57% of our net sales during fiscal 2005. Our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with these and other significant customers. Some of our customers could in the future shift some or all of their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, a significant reduction or delay in sales to these customers, an inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we could make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability. 4 Table of Contents Our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the aerospace industry The results of our aerospace business, which generated 27 percent of our revenues in 2005, are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries. The aviation industry is cyclical, and capital spending by airlines and aircraft manufacturers may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, worldwide airline profits and backlog levels. Also, since a significant portion of the backlog for commercial customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2006, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. A reduction in capital spending in the aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the sales of our Precision Aerospace product line, which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance or results of operations. Additionally, during a downturn in the cyclical aviation industry, there is substantial pressure on suppliers like us from OEMs in the aerospace industry to reduce prices on new orders. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost reduction strategies. If we were unable to offset OEM price reductions, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. Further, the consolidation and combination of defense or other manufacturers may eliminate customers from the industry and/or put downward pricing pressures on sales of component parts. For example, the consolidation that has occurred in the defense industry in recent years has significantly reduced the overall number of defense contractors in the industry. In addition, if one of our customers is acquired or merged with another entity, the new entity may discontinue using us as a supplier because of an existing business relationship with the acquiring company or because it may be more efficient to consolidate certain suppliers within the newly formed enterprise. The significance of the impact that such consolidation may have on our business is difficult to predict because we do not know when or if one or more of our customers will engage in merger or acquisition activity. However, if such activity involved our material customers it could materially impact our revenues and profitability. The aerospace industry is highly competitive, and this competition could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to grow. The aerospace industry is highly competitive. We compete with many U.S. and non-U.S. companies as well as the in-house manufacturing and service capabilities of large manufacturers, some of which may benefit from lower labor costs than us. We compete primarily based on product qualifications, service and price. Certain competitors are larger than we are or are subsidiaries of larger entities and may be better able to manage costs than us or may have greater financial resources than we have. Due to the competitiveness in the aerospace industry, we may not be able to increase prices for our products to cover increases in our costs, or we may face pressure to reduce prices, which could materially reduce our revenues, gross margin and profitability. Competitive factors, including changes in market penetration, increased price competition and the introduction of new products and technology by existing and new competitors could result in a material reduction in our revenues and profitability. 5 Table of Contents We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing Precision Aerospace backlog. There is an ongoing risk that aerospace orders may be cancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers business needs. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. Certain of our customers have the right to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If a customer terminates or reduces firm orders, we are able to invoice for work performed, but our future sales would be adversely affected. Also, the realization of sales from new and existing programs of all of our customers is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers will execute the launch of product programs on time, or at all, and the number of units that our customers will actually produce. We maintain a frozen defined benefit pension plan Declines in the stock market and prevailing interest rates could cause an increase in our pension benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension benefit obligations. These changes could cause a significant reduction in our net worth and may require us to make higher cash contributions to our pension plan in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and net income. Any product liability claims in excess of insurance could adversely affect our financial condition. There are potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of certain of our products. While we believe that our liability insurance is adequate to protect us from these liabilities, our insurance may not cover all liabilities. Any material liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We depend heavily on our senior management and other key personnel, the loss of whom could materially affect our financial performance and prospects. Our business is managed by a small number of key executive officers, including Dominick Pagano, Lou Melluzzo and Glenn Purple. Our future success will depend on, among other things, our ability to keep the services of these executives and to hire other highly qualified employees at all levels. We compete with other potential employers for employees, and we may not be successful in hiring and retaining executives and other skilled employees that we need. Our ability to successfully execute our business strategy, market and develop our products and serve our customers could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or executives.
