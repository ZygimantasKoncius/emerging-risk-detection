Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business, results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. In connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the SEC. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Should any of these risks materialize, our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted, which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities. Clearance of the proposed RSC merger from the Canadian Competition Bureau (the "Bureau") may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or cannot be met. Any delay in completing the merger with RSC due to difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals or satisfying other conditions may substantially reduce the benefits that we expect to obtain from the merger. We must receive clearance with respect to the proposed merger with RSC. Although the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act expired on January 20, 2012, the Bureau may impose conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger, any of which might have a material adverse effect on the combined company following the completion of the merger. Although we and RSC have agreed in the merger agreement to use our reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite governmental approvals and/or clearances, we cannot provide any assurance that clearance from the Bureau will be obtained or that there will not be any adverse consequences to our business or RSC's business resulting from the failure to obtain the clearance or from conditions that could be imposed in connection with obtaining the clearance, including divestitures or other operating restrictions upon us, RSC, the combined company or its subsidiaries. Clearance from the Bureau may not be obtained in a timely manner, and this could result in a delay in the consummation of the merger. In addition to obtaining the required governmental clearances and approvals, the merger is subject to a number of other conditions beyond our control, including, among others, receipt of approvals from our or RSC's stockholders and the receipt of a solvency opinion with respect to the combined company. We cannot predict whether or when the conditions required to complete the merger will be satisfied. Moreover, RSC or URI may terminate the merger agreement if the merger is not consummated by June 15, 2012, except in certain limited circumstances or if the transaction date is extended. Under specified circumstances, RSC or URI may be required to pay significant fees to the other party in connection with the termination of the merger agreement. Any delay in completing the merger, or failure to complete the merger as a result of such delay, may materially adversely affect the synergies and other benefits that we expect to achieve if the merger and the integration of our and RSC's respective businesses are completed within the expected timeframe (the first half of 2012).Combining our business with RSC's business following completion of the proposed merger may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, which may adversely affect our results and negatively affect the value of our stock following consummation of the merger. The success of the merger with RSC will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our business and RSC's business. If we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of our common stock may be affected adversely. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees and suppliers or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger.Issues that must be addressed in integrating the operations of RSC into our operations in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger include, among other things:•integrating and optimizing the utilization of our and RSC's rental equipment;•integrating our and RSC's marketing, information technology and other systems;•maintenance of the combined company's rental equipment portfolio;•conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the companies;•consolidating the equipment purchasing, maintenance and resale operations;8Table of Contents•consolidating corporate and administrative functions;•consolidating branch locations;•consolidating sales and marketing operations;•identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;•the retention of key employees;•minimizing the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns; and•the possibility of tax costs or inefficiencies associated with the integration of the operations of the combined company.An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon our revenues, level of expenses and operating results, which may adversely affect the value of our common stock after the completion of the merger.In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. Actual synergies, if achieved at all, may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. If we are not able to adequately address these challenges, we may be unable to successfully integrate RSC's operations into ours, or to fully realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies.The recent economic downturn, and resulting decreases in North American construction and industrial activities, adversely affected our revenues and operating results by decreasing the demand for our equipment and the prices that we could charge. A slowdown in the economic recovery or a decrease in general economic activity could have further adverse effects on our revenues and operating results. Our rental equipment is used primarily in the private non-residential construction industry, which is cyclical in nature. Trench safety, power and HVAC equipment is principally used in connection with construction and industrial activities. Over the past several years, our industry has experienced a decline in construction and industrial activity, and we experienced weakness in our end markets, though we saw modest improvements in our operating environment in 2011. The weakness in our end markets led to a decrease in the demand for our equipment and the prices that we can charge and could lead to further decreases. Such decreases adversely affect our operating results by causing our revenues to decline and, because certain of our costs are fixed, our operating margins to be reduced. While many areas of the global economy are improving, a slowdown in the economic recovery or worsening of economic conditions, in particular with respect to North American construction and industrial activities, could cause further weakness in our end markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results. The following factors, among others, may cause weakness in our end markets, either temporarily or long-term: •a decrease in expected levels of infrastructure spending, including lower than expected government funding for economic stimulus projects; •a lack of availability of credit; •an increase in the cost of construction materials; •an increase in interest rates; •adverse weather conditions, which may temporarily affect a particular region; or •terrorism or hostilities involving the United States or Canada. If we are unable to collect on contracts with customers, our operating results would be adversely affected. One of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere. This has been particularly true in industries with high growth rates such as the construction industry. However, some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us. If we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately, or if a large number of customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected. Further, delinquencies and credit losses generally can be expected to increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Our operating results may fluctuate, which could affect the trading value of our securities. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors, which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities. These factors, in addition to general economic conditions and the factors discussed above under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”, include, but are not limited to: 9Table of Contents•seasonal rental patterns of our customers, with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter; •changes in the size of our rental fleet and/or in the rate at which we sell our used equipment; •changes in private non-residential construction spending or government funding for infrastructure and other construction projects; •changes in demand for, or utilization of, our equipment or in the prices we charge due to changes in economic conditions, competition or other factors; •commodity price pressures and the resultant increase in the cost of fuel and steel to our equipment suppliers, which can result in increased equipment costs for us; •other cost fluctuations, such as costs for employee-related compensation and healthcare benefits; •labor shortages, work stoppages or other labor difficulties; •potential enactment of new legislation affecting our operations or labor relations; •completion of acquisitions (including the proposed merger with RSC), divestitures or recapitalizations; •increases in interest rates and related increases in our interest expense and our debt service obligations; •the possible need, from time to time, to record goodwill impairment charges or other write-offs or charges due to a variety of occurrences, such as the adoption of new accounting standards, the impairment of assets, rental location divestitures, dislocation in the equity and/or credit markets, consolidations or closings, restructurings, the refinancing of existing indebtedness or the buy-out of equipment leases; and •currency risks and other risks of international operations. Our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. Our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons, including: •announcements of developments related to our business; •market perceptions of the pending merger with RSC and the likelihood of our involvement in other merger and acquisition activity; •variations in our revenues, gross margins, earnings or other financial results from investors’ expectations; •departure of key personnel; •purchases or sales of large blocks of our stock by institutional investors or transactions by insiders; •fluctuations in the results of our operations and general conditions in the economy, our market, and the markets served by our customers; •investor perceptions of the equipment rental industry in general and our Company in particular; and •the operating and stock performance of comparable companies or related industries. In addition, prices in the stock market have been volatile over the past few years. In many cases, the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. As a result, the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our or our competitors’ operating performance. Our current level of indebtedness, which will increase upon completion of the RSC acquisition, exposes us to various risks. At December 31, 2011, our total indebtedness was approximately $3.0 billion, including $55 million of subordinated convertible debentures. In the event that the proposed merger with RSC is completed, we intend to finance the cash portion of the RSC merger consideration and repay the outstanding amounts on RSC's existing senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes due 2017 through new debt issuances and drawing on current loan facilities, and to assume all of RSC's existing unsecured debt. We estimate that the principal amount of our total indebtedness will increase by approximately $3.7 billion following completion of the RSC merger. Our substantial indebtedness has the potential to affect us adversely in a number of ways. For example, it will or could: •increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments; •require us to devote a substantial portion of our cash flow to debt service, reducing the funds available for other purposes or otherwise constraining our financial flexibility; 10Table of Contents•restrict our ability to move operating cash flows to Holdings. As of December 31, 2011, primarily due to losses sustained in prior years, URNA had limited restricted payment capacity under the most restrictive restricted payment covenants in the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness; •affect our ability to obtain additional financing, particularly since substantially all of our assets are subject to security interests relating to existing indebtedness; and •decrease our profitability or cash flow. Our increased indebtedness following consummation of the merger with RSC could further adversely affect our operations and liquidity. In addition to increasing the foregoing risks, our anticipated level of indebtedness could, among other things: •cause us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; •cause us to be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less leverage; •result in a downgrade in our credit rating or the credit ratings of any of the indebtedness of our subsidiaries which could increase the cost of further borrowings; and•limit our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. Further, if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include: •reducing or delaying capital expenditures; •limiting our growth; •seeking additional capital; •selling assets; or •restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness. Even if we adopt an alternative strategy, the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations. A portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates. As a result, an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations. At December 31, 2011, we had $1,065 million of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates, which we expect to increase following the RSC acquisition as we intend to finance a portion of the merger by drawing on our current loan facilities. Our variable rate indebtedness currently represents 35 percent of our total indebtedness, including our subordinated convertible debentures. We expect this percentage to decrease significantly following the RSC acquisition, as our variable rate indebtedness will represent a smaller portion of our total indebtedness following the acquisition. See Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information related to interest rate risk. Despite our indebtedness level, which will increase in connection with the acquisition of RSC, following the acquisition, we may be able to incur substantially more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our level of indebtedness. Despite our indebtedness level, which will increase following the acquisition of RSC, we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future. We are not fully restricted under the terms of the indentures or agreements governing our indebtedness from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not prohibited by the terms of the indentures or agreements governing our indebtedness, any of which could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our level of indebtedness. If we are unable to satisfy the financial and other covenants in certain of our debt agreements, our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings, or we could face other substantial costs. Under the agreement governing our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL facility”), we are required, among other things, to satisfy certain financial tests relating to: (i) the fixed charge coverage ratio and (ii) the ratio of senior secured debt to adjusted EBITDA. As discussed in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, in October 2011, we 11Table of Contentsamended the ABL facility. Subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the ABL facility, these covenants will only apply in the future if availability under the ABL facility falls below the greater of 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the ABL facility and $150 million. Since the October 2011 amendment date and through December 31, 2011, availability under the ABL facility has exceeded the required threshold and, as a result, these maintenance covenants have been inapplicable. Under our accounts receivable securitization facility, we are required, among other things, to maintain certain financial tests relating to: (i) the default ratio, (ii) the delinquency ratio, (iii) the dilution ratio and (iv) days sales outstanding. If we are unable to satisfy these or any other of the relevant covenants, the lenders could elect to terminate the ABL facility and/or the accounts receivable securitization facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings. In such event, unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the ABL facility, accounts receivable securitization facility and/or the other agreements governing our debt, we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above. Even if we adopt an alternative strategy, the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity to service our debt and fund our operations. Restrictive covenants in certain of the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility. In addition to the risks with respect to covenant non-compliance, compliance with covenants may restrict our ability to conduct our operations. These covenants could adversely affect our operating results by significantly limiting our operating and financial flexibility. In addition to financial covenants, various other covenants in the ABL facility, accounts receivable securitization facility, and the other agreements governing our debt restrict our ability to, among other things: •incur additional indebtedness; •make prepayments of certain indebtedness; •pay dividends; •repurchase common stock; •make investments; •create liens; and •sell assets and engage in mergers and acquisitions. We rely on available borrowings under the ABL facility and accounts receivable securitization facility for cash to operate our business, which subjects us to risk, some of which is beyond our control. In addition to cash we generate from our business, our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under the ABL facility and accounts receivable securitization facility. If our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced, or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason, we may not be able to fund daily operations, which may cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern. In addition, if any of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities, we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds, which could have similar adverse consequences. If we are unable to obtain additional capital as required, we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business. If the cash that we generate from our business, together with cash that we may borrow under the ABL facility and accounts receivable securitization facility, is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements, we will require additional debt and/or equity financing. However, we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing or such financing may include terms that are not satisfactory to us. We may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors, including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the ABL facility and/or other agreements governing our debt. In the event we seek to obtain equity financing, our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities. This dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future, we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business, including those relating to purchasing equipment, growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness. If we determine that our goodwill has become impaired, we may incur impairment charges, which would negatively impact our operating results. At December 31, 2011, we had $289 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. We assess potential impairment of our goodwill at least annually. Impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets, negative 12Table of Contentsindustry or economic trends and/or significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results. We have a holding company structure and we will depend in part on distributions from our subsidiaries in order to pay amounts due on our indebtedness. Certain provisions of law or contractual restrictions could limit distributions from our subsidiaries. We derive substantially all of our operating income from, and hold substantially all of our assets through, our subsidiaries. The effect of this structure is that we depend in part on the earnings of our subsidiaries, and the payment or other distribution to us of these earnings, in order to meet our obligations under our outstanding debt. Provisions of law, such as those requiring that dividends be paid only from surplus, could limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments or other distributions to us. Furthermore, these subsidiaries could in certain circumstances agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions. We are subject to certain purported class action and stockholder litigation, which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. As described in greater detail under Item 3-Legal Proceedings, we are subject to certain purported class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits. We can give no assurances as to the outcome of these proceedings and, regardless of the outcome, we may incur significant costs, including defense and indemnification costs, and the time and attention of our management may be diverted from normal business operations. If we are ultimately required to pay significant costs, damages or settlement amounts, such payments, to the extent not covered, advanced or timely reimbursed by insurance, could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. We are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business, and our insurance may not fully cover them. We are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business. These claims include those relating to (i) personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us, (ii) motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and (iii) employment-related claims. Further, as described elsewhere in this report, several stockholder derivative and class action lawsuits have been filed against us. Currently, we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations. However, such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons, including: •our insurance policies, reflecting a program structure that we believe reflects market conditions for companies our size, are often subject to significant deductibles or self-insured retentions: $2 million per occurrence for each general liability or automobile liability claim, and $1 million per occurrence for each workers’ compensation claim; •our director and officer liability insurance policy has no deductible for individual non-indemnifiable loss coverage, but is subject to a $2.5 million deductible for company reimbursement coverage and all director and officer coverage is subject to certain exclusions; •we do not maintain stand-alone coverage for environmental liability (other than legally required coverage), since we believe the cost for such coverage is high relative to the benefit it provides; and •certain types of claims, such as claims for punitive damages or for damages arising from intentional misconduct, which are often alleged in third party lawsuits, might not be covered by our insurance. We establish and regularly evaluate our loss reserves to address business operations claims, or portions thereof, not covered by our insurance policies. To the extent that we are found liable for any significant claim or claims that exceed our established levels of reserves, or that are not otherwise covered by insurance, we could have to significantly increase our reserves, and our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. For instance, during the fourth quarter of 2010, we recognized a charge of $24 million related to our provision for self-insurance reserves. The charge in particular reflected adverse experience in our portfolio of automobile and general liability claims, as well as worker’s compensation claims. In addition, the purported class action and derivative lawsuits against us, and our indemnification costs associated with such matters, may not be fully reimbursable or covered by insurance. It is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all. We have made acquisitions in the past, which entail certain risks, as do any growth initiatives, including additional acquisitions or consolidations, that we may pursue in the future. We have historically achieved a portion of our growth through acquisitions, and we will continue to consider potential acquisitions on a selective basis. From time-to-time we have also approached, or have been approached, to explore consolidation opportunities with other public companies or large privately-held companies. Whether historical or in the future, it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from our acquisitions or 13Table of Contentsthat our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions. Acquisitions entail certain risks, including: •unrecorded liabilities of acquired companies that we fail to discover during our due diligence investigations or that are not subject to indemnification or reimbursement by the seller; •difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company within our existing operations or in maintaining uniform standards; •loss of key employees of the acquired company; •the failure to achieve anticipated synergies; and •strains on management and other personnel time and resources to evaluate, negotiate and integrate acquisitions. We would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash, capital stock, notes and/or assumption of indebtedness. To the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient in any instance, we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing, which involves its own risks, such as the dilutive effect on shares held by our stockholders if we financed acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities. We have also spent resources and efforts, apart from acquisitions, in attempting to enhance our rental business over the past few years. These efforts place strains on our management and other personnel time and resources, and require timely and continued investment in facilities, personnel and financial and management systems and controls. We may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives, which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues, causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected. Our charter provisions, as well as other factors, may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the Company. Although our Board elected not to extend our stockholders’ rights plan upon its expiration in September 2011, we still have in place certain charter provisions, such as the inability for stockholders to act by written consent, that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the Company that are not approved by our board, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, under certain circumstances, restricts the ability of a publicly held Delaware corporation to engage in a business combination, such as a merger or sale of assets, with any stockholder that, together with affiliates, owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock, which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction. In addition, under the ABL facility, a change of control (as defined in the credit agreement) constitutes an event of default, entitling our lenders to terminate the ABL facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings. A change of control (as defined in the applicable agreement) is also a termination event under our accounts receivable securitization facility and generally would require us to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes. As a result, the provisions of the agreements governing our debt also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control. Turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy. Our success is dependent, in part, on the experience and skills of our management team, and competition in our industry and the business world for top management talent is generally significant. Although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages, we can provide no assurance that our efforts to attract and retain senior management staff will be successful. Moreover, given the volatility in our stock price, it may be more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees, particularly senior management, through grants of stock or stock options. This in turn could place greater pressure on the Company to increase the cash component of its compensation packages, which may adversely affect our operating results. If we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions, or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion, we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy. Our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect. We have been pursuing a strategy of optimizing our field operations in order to improve sales force effectiveness, and to focus our sales force’s efforts on increasing revenues from our National Account and other large customers. We are also continuing to pursue our overall cost reduction program, which resulted in substantial cost savings in the past. The extent to which these strategies will achieve our desired efficiencies and goals in 2012 and beyond is uncertain, as their success depends on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we currently expect, we may not achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate, or on the timetable we anticipate, and there may be 14Table of Contentsunforeseen productivity, revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that may adversely affect us. Therefore, there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving desired profitability, margins or returns to stockholders. We are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms. We have achieved significant cost savings through our centralization of equipment and non-equipment purchases. However, as a result, we depend on and are exposed to the credit risk of a group of key suppliers. While we make every effort to evaluate our counterparties prior to entering into long-term and other significant procurement contracts, we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the current economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses. Insolvency, financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us. Further, such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us, or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us. Although we believe we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment and other supplies used in our business, termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we were unable to obtain adequate equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner or at all. If our rental fleet ages, our operating costs may increase, we may be unable to pass along such costs, and our earnings may decrease. The costs of new equipment we use in our fleet may increase, requiring us to spend more for replacement equipment or preventing us from procuring equipment on a timely basis. If our rental equipment ages, the costs of maintaining such equipment, if not replaced within a certain period of time, will likely increase. The costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future and could lead to material adverse effects on our results of operations. The cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet could also increase due to increased material costs to our suppliers or other factors beyond our control. Such increases could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. Furthermore, changes in customer demand could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs. Our industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge. The equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive. Our competitors include small, independent businesses with one or two rental locations, regional competitors that operate in one or more states, public companies or divisions of public companies, and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers. We may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new companies. Competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by, among other things, decreasing our rental volumes, depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees. Disruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations. Our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. Any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. In addition, because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses, our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold, whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenues, increased costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations. We are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations. If we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated, our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters. These laws regulate such issues as wastewater, stormwater, solid and hazardous waste and materials, and air quality. Under these laws, we may be liable for, among other things, (i) the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous waste for disposal or treatment, regardless of fault and (ii) fines and penalties for non-compliance. Our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks, but we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment, dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment 15Table of Contentswashing, and store and dispense petroleum products from above-ground storage tanks located at certain of our locations. Based on conditions currently known to us, we do not believe that any pending or likely remediation and/or compliance effort will have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot be certain, however, as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent. If we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated, our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, depending on the magnitude of such costs. We have operations throughout the United States, which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations, in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor. Changes in applicable law, regulations or requirements, or our material failure to comply with any of them, can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business. Our 436 branch locations in the United States are located in 48 states, which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations, in addition to federal law and regulatory and contractual requirements we face as a government contractor. These laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations, such as worker safety, consumer rights, privacy, employee benefits and more, and there are often different requirements in different jurisdictions. Changes in these requirements, or any material failure by our branches to comply with them, can increase our costs, affect our reputation, limit our business, drain management time and attention and generally otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways. Labor disputes could disrupt our ability to serve our customers and/or lead to higher labor costs. We currently have approximately 650 employees who are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 6,850 employees who are not represented by unions. Various unions occasionally seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees. Union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages and/or slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees, which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers. Further, settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs, productivity and flexibility. Fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business. We believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet. Accordingly, we could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us for transporting equipment from one branch to another branch. Although we have used, and may continue to use, futures contracts to hedge against fluctuations in fuel prices, a significant or protracted price fluctuation or disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition, and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect. The market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including: •the market price for new equipment of a like kind; •wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age and the performance of preventive maintenance; •the time of year that it is sold; •the supply of used equipment on the market; •the existence and capacities of different sales outlets; •the age of the equipment at the time it is sold; •worldwide and domestic demand for used equipment; and •general economic conditions. We include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment. Sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections and/or in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. We have operations outside the United States. As a result, we may incur losses from currency conversions and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws. 16Table of ContentsOur operations in Canada are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations. These include (i) the need to convert currencies, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and (ii) the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations, as well as U.S. laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions.
