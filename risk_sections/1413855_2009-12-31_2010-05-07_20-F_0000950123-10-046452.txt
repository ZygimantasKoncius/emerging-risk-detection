Registered Office and Objects The Registered Office of our company is at the offices of Maples Corporate Services Limited, PO Box 309, Ugland House, Grand Cayman, KY1-1104, Cayman Islands, or at such other place as our board of directors may from time to time decide. The objects for which our company is established are unrestricted and we have full power and authority to carry out any object not prohibited by the Companies Law (2007 Revision) or as the same may be revised from time to time, or any other law of the Cayman Islands. Board of Directors See Item 6.C. Directors, Senior Management and EmployeesBoard PracticesBoard of Directors. Ordinary Shares General. Our authorized share capital consists of 10,000,000,000 shares, with a par value of US$0.001 each. All of our outstanding ordinary shares are fully paid and non-assessable. Certificates representing the ordinary shares are issued in registered form. Our shareholders who are nonresidents of the Cayman Islands may freely hold and vote their shares. Dividend Rights. The holders of our ordinary shares are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by our board of directors subject to the Companies Law. Voting Rights. Each ordinary share is entitled to one vote on all matters upon which the ordinary shares are entitled to vote. Voting at any meeting of shareholders is by show of hands unless a poll is demanded. A poll may be demanded by the chairman of the meeting or by any one or more shareholders together holding at least ten percent of our paid up voting share capital, present in person or by proxy. A quorum required for a meeting of shareholders consists of shareholders holding in aggregate not less than one-third of our issued voting share capital present in person or by proxy or, if a corporation or other non-natural person, by its duly authorized representative. We may, but are not obliged, to hold an annual general meeting of shareholders. General meetings may be convened by our board of directors on its own initiative or upon a request to the directors by shareholders holding in aggregate not less than one-third of our voting share capital. Advance notice of at least 14 days is required for the convening of our annual general meeting and other shareholders meetings. -85- Table of Contents An ordinary resolution to be passed by the shareholders requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes attaching to the ordinary shares cast in a general meeting, while a special resolution requires the affirmative vote of no less than two-thirds of the votes cast attaching to the ordinary shares. A special resolution is required for important matters such as a change of name. Holders of the ordinary shares may effect certain changes by ordinary resolution, including consolidating and dividing all or any of our share capital into shares of larger amount than our existing share capital, and canceling any shares which have not been taken or agreed to be taken. Transfer of Shares. Subject to the restrictions of our articles of association, as applicable, any of our shareholders may transfer all or any of his or her ordinary shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or any other form approved by our board. Liquidation. On a return of capital on winding up or otherwise (other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of shares), assets available for distribution among the holders of ordinary shares may be distributed among the holders of the ordinary shares as determined by the liquidator, subject to sanction of an ordinary resolution of our company. Calls on Shares and Forfeiture of Shares. Our board of directors may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their shares in a notice served to such shareholders at least 14 days prior to the specified time of payment. The shares that have been called upon and remain unpaid on the specified time are subject to forfeiture. Redemption and Repurchase of Shares. Subject to the provisions of the Companies Law and our articles of association, we may issue shares on terms that they are subject to redemption, at our option or at the option of the holders, on such terms and in such manner as we may determine by special resolution before the issue of such shares. We also may purchase our own shares, provided that our shareholders have approved the manner of purchase by ordinary resolution or the manner of purchase is in accordance with that specified in our articles of association. The manner of purchase specified in our articles of association, which cover purchases of shares listed on an internationally recognized stock exchange and shares not so listed, is in accordance with Section 37(2) of the Companies Law or any modification or reenactment thereof for the time being in force. Variations of Rights of Shares. All or any of the special rights attached to any class of shares may, subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, be varied either with the written consent of the holders of a majority of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. Inspection of Books and Records. Holders of our ordinary shares have no general right under Cayman Islands law to inspect or obtain copies of our list of shareholders or our corporate records.
