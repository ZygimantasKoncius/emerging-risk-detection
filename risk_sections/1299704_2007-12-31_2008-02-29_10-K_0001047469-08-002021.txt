ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Our business is highly regulated. Changes in applicable laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business is subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations, which are subject to change and which may impose significant costs or limitations on the way we conduct or expand our business. These regulations govern or affect, among other things, interest rates and other fees, check cashing fees, lending practices, recording and reporting of certain financial transactions, privacy of personal consumer information and collection practices. As we develop new product and service offerings, we may become subject to additional federal, state and local regulations. State and local governments may also seek to impose new licensing requirements or interpret or enforce existing requirements in new ways. In addition, changes in current laws and future laws or regulations may restrict our ability to continue our current methods of operation or expand our operations. Changes in laws or regulations, or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our industry is highly regulated under state law. Changes in state laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business is regulated under a variety of enabling state statutes, including payday advance, deferred presentment, check-cashing, money transmission, small loan and credit services organization state laws, all of which are subject to change and which may impose significant costs or limitations on the way we conduct or expand our business. As of December 31, 2007, 39 states and the District of Columbia had specific laws that permitted payday cash advances or a similar form of short-term consumer loans. As of December 31, 2007, we operated in 35 of these 39 states. We do not currently conduct business in the remaining four states or in the District of Columbia because we do not believe it is economically attractive to operate in these jurisdictions due to specific legislative restrictions, such as interest rate ceilings, an unattractive population density or unattractive location characteristics. However, we may open centers in any of these states or the District of Columbia if we believe doing so may become economically attractive because of a change in any of these variables. The remaining 11 states do not have laws specifically authorizing the payday cash advance or short-term consumer finance business. Despite the lack of specific laws, other laws may permit us to do business in these states. During the last few years, legislation has been adopted in some states that prohibits or severely restricts payday cash advance and similar services. Many similar bills have also been introduced in state legislatures. In 2007, bills that would severely restrict or effectively prohibit payday cash advances if adopted as law were introduced in 20 states plus the District of Columbia. In addition, two states have sunset provisions in their payday cash advance laws that require renewal of the laws by these state legislatures at periodic intervals. Such new or modified legislation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. For example, as a result of legislation in Oregon that became effective in July 2007, we concluded that operating in that state was no longer economically viable and closed all of our Oregon centers. Laws prohibiting payday cash advance and similar services or making them unprofitable could be passed in any other state at any time or existing enabling laws could expire or be amended, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Statutes authorizing payday cash advance and similar services typically provide the state agencies that regulate banks and financial institutions with significant regulatory powers to administer and enforce the law. In most states, we are required to apply for a license, file periodic written reports 18 regarding business operations and undergo comprehensive state examinations to ensure that we comply with applicable laws. Under statutory authority, state regulators have broad discretionary power and may impose new licensing requirements, interpret or enforce existing regulatory requirements in different ways or issue new administrative rules, even if not contained in state statutes, that impact the way we do business and may force us to terminate or modify our operations in particular states. They may also impose rules that are generally adverse to our industry. Any new licensing requirements or rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In some cases, we rely on the interpretations of the staff of state regulatory bodies with respect to the laws and regulations of their respective jurisdictions. These staff interpretations generally are not binding legal authority and may be subject to challenge in administrative or judicial proceedings. Additionally, as the staff of state regulatory bodies change, it is possible that their interpretations of applicable laws and regulations also may change and negatively affect our business. As a result, our reliance on staff interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, state attorneys general and banking regulators have begun to scrutinize payday cash advances and other alternative financial products and take actions that could require us to modify, suspend or cease operations in their respective states. For example, in December 2005, the Commissioner of Banks for North Carolina ordered our North Carolina subsidiary to immediately cease all business operations. Similarly, as a result of an adverse ruling in July 2007 in a case brought by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking, we suspended our operations and subsequently closed all of our centers in Pennsylvania. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings." These closures have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our industry is regulated under federal law and subject to federal and state unfair and deceptive practices statutes. Our failure to comply with these regulations and statutes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although states provide the primary regulatory framework under which we offer advances, certain federal laws also impact our business. See "Item 1. BusinessÂ—Federal Regulation." Because advances are viewed as extensions of credit, we must comply with the federal Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation Z adopted under that Act. Additionally, we are subject to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. We are also subject to the Bank Secrecy Act, the Money Laundering Act, and the PATRIOT Act. Any failure to comply with any of these federal laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, various anti-payday cash advance legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress. Congressional members continue to receive pressure from consumer advocates and other industry opposition groups to adopt such legislation. On October 17, 2006, the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (the "Act") was signed into law. This Act places, among other restrictions, a limit of 36% on the effective annual percentage rate on extensions of credit, including payday cash advances, to active members of the military and their dependents. Any federal legislative or regulatory action that restricts or prohibits payday cash advance and similar services could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In 2006, we voluntarily ceased qualifying customers for advances based on income from military service. Our marketing efforts and the representations we make about our advances also are subject to federal and state unfair and deceptive practices statutes. The FTC enforces the Federal Trade Commission Act and the state attorneys general and private plaintiffs enforce the analogous state statutes. If we are found to have violated any of these statutes, that violation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 19 Our industry is subject to various local rules and regulations. Changes in these local regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition to state and federal laws and regulations, our business can be subject to various local rules and regulations such as local zoning regulations. Any actions taken in the future by local zoning boards or other local governing bodies to require special use permits for, or impose other restrictions on providers of payday cash advance and similar services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. From time to time, we may also choose to operate in a state even if legislation or regulations cause us to lose money on our operations in that state. For example, regulatory changes in Indiana and Illinois have reduced our revenue and profitability in those states. Any similar actions or events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our foreign operations are subject to additional laws and regulations. Our inability to operate in the United Kingdom or Canada in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the United Kingdom, consumer lending is governed by the Consumer Credit Act of 1974, which was recently amended by the Consumer Credit Act of 2006, and related rules and regulations. Our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom must maintain licenses from the Office of Fair Trading, which is responsible for regulating consumer credit and competition, for policy and for consumer protection. The United Kingdom also has strict rules regarding the presentation, form and content of loan agreements, including statutory warnings and the layout of financial information. Our non-compliance with these rules could render a loan agreement unenforceable. Our inability to obtain and maintain the required licenses or to comply with the applicable rules or regulations in the United Kingdom would limit our expansion opportunities and could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In Canada, the Canadian Parliament recently amended the federal usury law to transfer jurisdiction and the development of laws and regulation of our industry to the respective provinces. To date, four provinces have proposed substantive regulation of our industry. In general, the proposed regulations require lenders to be licensed, set maximum fees and regulate collection practices. However, the proposed regulations may undergo significant additional revisions. Our expansion in Canada may be limited due to this uncertain regulatory landscape. Further, our inability to comply with new regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Current and future litigation and regulatory proceedings against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business is subject to lawsuits and regulatory proceedings that could generate adverse publicity and cause us to incur substantial expenditures. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings." Adverse rulings in some of these lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could significantly impair our business or force us to cease doing business in one or more states. We are likely to be subject to further litigation and proceedings in the future. The consequences of an adverse ruling in any current or future litigation or proceeding could cause us to have to refund fees and/or interest collected, refund the principal amount of advances, pay treble or other multiple damages, pay monetary penalties and/or modify or terminate our operations in particular states. We may also be subject to adverse publicity. Defense of any lawsuits or proceedings, even if successful, requires substantial time and attention of our senior officers and other management personnel that would otherwise be spent on other aspects of our business and requires the expenditure of significant amounts for legal fees and other related costs. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 20 Competition in our industry could cause us to lose market share or reduce our interest and fees, possibly resulting in a decline in our future revenues and earnings. The industry in which we operate has low barriers to entry and is highly fragmented and very competitive. We believe that the market may become even more competitive as the industry grows and/or consolidates. We compete with services provided by traditional financial institutions, such as overdraft protection, and with other payday cash advance providers, small loan providers, credit unions, short-term consumer lenders, other financial service entities and other retail businesses that offer consumer loans or other products and services that are similar to ours. We also compete with companies offering payday cash advances and short-term loans over the internet as well as by phone. Some of these competitors have larger local or regional customer bases, more locations and substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. As a result of this increasing competition, we could lose market share or we may need to reduce our interest and fees, possibly resulting in a decline in our future revenues and earnings. The concentration of our revenues in certain states could adversely affect us. We operated centers in 37 states during the year ended December 31, 2007, and our five largest states (measured by total revenues) accounted for approximately 47% of our total revenues. While we believe we have a diverse geographic presence, for the near term we expect that significant revenues will continue to be generated by certain states, largely due to the currently prevailing economic, demographic, regulatory, competitive and other conditions in those states. For example, during 2007, California and Texas each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. Changes to prevailing economic, demographic, regulatory or any other conditions in the markets in which we operate could lead to a reduction in demand for our products and services, a decline in our revenues or an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts that could result in a deterioration of our financial condition. Media reports and public perception of payday cash advances and similar loans as being predatory or abusive could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Consumer advocacy groups and certain media reports advocate for governmental and regulatory action to prohibit or severely restrict payday cash advances and similar loans. The consumer groups and media reports typically focus on the cost to a consumer for an advance and typically characterize these advances as predatory or abusive toward consumers. If this negative characterization of advances becomes widely accepted by consumers, demand for advance services could significantly decrease, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Negative perception of advances or our other activities could also result in increased regulatory scrutiny and litigation, encourage restrictive local zoning rules, make it more difficult to obtain government approvals necessary to open new centers and cause payday cash advance industry trade groups, such as the CFSA, to promote policies that cause our business to be less profitable. These trends could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The provision for doubtful accounts may increase and net income may decrease if we are unable to collect customers' personal checks that are returned due to non-sufficient funds ("NSF") in the customers' accounts or other reasons. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we deposited approximately 6.2% and 5.7%, respectively, of all the customer checks we received and approximately 76% and 78%, respectively, of these deposited customer checks were returned unpaid because of non-sufficient funds in the customers' bank accounts or because of closed accounts or stop-payment orders. Total charge-offs, net of recoveries, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were approximately $131.9 million and $110.4 million, respectively. If the number of customer checks that we deposit increases or the 21 percentage of the customers' returned checks that we charge-off increases, our provision for doubtful accounts will increase and our net income will decrease. If our estimates of losses are not adequate, our provision for doubtful accounts would increase. This would result in a decline in our future revenues and earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses for advances we make directly to consumers and check-cashing, deferred-presentment and other credit services. We also maintain an accrual for third-party lender losses for loans and certain related fees that are not paid by the customers for all loans that are processed by us for the third-party lender in Texas. To estimate the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and accrual for third-party lender losses, we consider the amount of outstanding advances, historical charge-offs, our current collection patterns and the current economic trends in the markets we serve. At December 31, 2007, the total of our allowance for doubtful accounts and accrual for third-party lender losses increased to $65.9 million from $57.4 million at December 31, 2006. This amount, however, is an estimate. If our actual losses are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts and accrual for third-party lender losses, our provision for doubtful accounts would increase. This would result in a decline in our future revenues and earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. We currently lack product and business diversification; as a result, our future revenues and earnings may be disproportionately negatively impacted by external factors and may be more susceptible to fluctuations than more diversified companies. Our primary business activity is offering payday cash advance services. If we are unable to maintain and grow our advance services business, our future revenues and earnings could decline. Our current lack of product and business diversification could inhibit our opportunities for growth, reduce our revenues and profits and make us more susceptible to earnings fluctuations than many of our competitors who are more diversified and provide other services such as pawn lending, title lending or other similar services. External factors, such as changes in laws and regulations, new entrants and enhanced competition, could also make it more difficult for us to operate as profitably as a more diversified company could operate. Any internal or external change in our industry could result in a decline in our future revenues and earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. Our inability to efficiently and profitably introduce or manage new products or alternative methods for conducting business could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In October 2006, we began offering installment loans in Illinois and selling a prepaid debit card in select states. In 2007, we began selling money orders and providing money transfer services. We also intend to introduce additional services and products in the future. In order to offer new products, we will need to comply with additional regulatory and licensing requirements. Each of these changes, alternative methods of conducting business and new services and products are subject to risk and uncertainty and require significant investment in time and capital, including additional marketing expenses, legal costs and other incremental start-up costs. Due to our lack of experience in offering these alternative services and products, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully introduce any new services or products or do so in a timely manner. Furthermore, we cannot predict the demand for new services or products, nor do we know if we will be able to offer these new services or products in an efficient manner or on a profitable basis. Our failure to do so, or low customer demand for any of these new services or products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 22 Our offering of extended payment plans to customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In July 2007, we expanded the number of states where we allow customers who could not timely repay their advances to qualify for extended payment plans to include every state where we offer advances. We previously offered extended payment plans in only certain states as required under applicable state law. The ability of a customer to defer payment will likely increase the average duration of a payday cash advance, which may in turn affect our revenues, loss experience and provision for doubtful accounts. The expansion of our operations into Canada and the United Kingdom may contribute materially to increased costs and negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have devoted significant management time and financial resources to expanding our operations outside of the United States. Our international operations have increased the complexity of our organization and the administrative, operating and legal cost of operating our business. Penetrating new markets will likely require additional marketing expenses and incremental start-up costs. We may decide to reduce fees, or even temporarily operate centers at a loss, in order to build brand recognition and establish a foothold in these new markets. For example, in Manitoba, Canada, we have opened seven centers that are currently not profitable in anticipation of more favorable provincial legislation. Additionally, as a foreign business we are subject to local regulations, tariffs and labor controls to which other domestic businesses are not subject. Our financial results also may be negatively affected by tax rates in the United Kingdom and Canada or as a result of withholding requirements and tax treaties with those countries. Moreover, if political, regulatory or economic conditions deteriorate in the United Kingdom and Canada, our ability to expand and maintain our international operations could be impaired and the costs of doing so could increase, which could further erode our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to find additional growth opportunities may be limited. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or further expand our market presence in our current markets or successfully enter new markets through the opening of new centers or acquisitions. Moreover, the start-up costs and the losses from initial operations attributable to each newly opened center place demands upon our liquidity and cash flow, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to satisfy these demands. In addition, our ability to grow depends on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: Â•the prevailing laws and regulatory environment of each jurisdiction in which we operate or seek to operate, which are subject to change at any time; Â•our ability to obtain and maintain any regulatory approvals, government permits or licenses that may be required; Â•our ability to identify, implement and manage new products and services that are compatible with our business; Â•the degree of competition in new markets and for new products and services and our ability to attract new customers; Â•our ability to compete for expansion opportunities in suitable locations; Â•our ability to recruit, train and retain qualified personnel; Â•our ability to adapt our infrastructure and systems to accommodate our growth; and Â•our ability to obtain adequate financing for our expansion plans. 23 We cannot assure you that our systems, procedures, controls and existing personnel will be adequate to support our further growth. Our new international operations increase the complexity of our organization, our administrative costs, and the regulatory risks we face and therefore could destabilize our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our future results of operations will substantially depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our technical, administrative, financial control and reporting systems. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our business strategy profitably in geographic areas or product lines we do not currently serve. We depend to a substantial extent on borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund our liquidity needs, including cash dividends and common stock repurchases. We have an existing revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to $265.0 million, assuming we are in compliance with a number of covenants and conditions. Because we typically use substantially all of our available cash generated from our operations to repay borrowings on our revolving credit facility on a current basis, we have limited cash balances and we expect that a substantial portion of our liquidity needs, including any amounts to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock and repurchases of our common stock, will be funded primarily from borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $120.5 million available for future borrowings under this facility. On October 17, 2007, we amended this credit facility to exclude from certain financial covenants the charges and losses incurred in connection with our announced closing of 103 centers in Pennsylvania, Oregon and elsewhere. Without this amendment, we would not have been able to pay our full regular quarterly dividend during the fourth quarter of 2007. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, our borrowings are historically the lowest during the first calendar quarter and increase during the remainder of the year. If our existing sources of liquidity are insufficient to satisfy our financial needs, we may need to raise additional debt or equity in the future. If we are unable to do so, our ability to pay future dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock, or finance our current operations or future growth may be impaired. We may incur substantial additional debt, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition by limiting our ability to obtain financing in the future and react to changes in our business. We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. As of December 31, 2007, our total debt was approximately $148.0 million and our stockholders' equity was approximately $250.3 million. The total availability under our current credit facility is $265.0 million, which we may borrow at any time, subject to compliance with certain covenants and conditions. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, our total debt is historically the lowest during the first calendar quarter and then increases during the remainder of the year. If we incur substantial additional debt, it could have important consequences to our business. For example, it could: Â•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt obligations, which will reduce our funds available for dividends, stock repurchases, working capital, capital expenditures and our growth strategy; Â•restrict our operational flexibility through restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to make acquisitions, explore certain business opportunities, dispose of assets and take other actions; Â•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business; Â•limit our ability to borrow additional funds in the future, if we need them, due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt instruments; 24 Â•make us vulnerable to interest rate increases, because a portion of our borrowings is, and will continue to be, at variable rates of interest; and Â•place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt. The terms of our debt limit our ability to incur additional debt but do not prohibit us from incurring additional debt. When debt levels increase, the related risks that we now face will also increase. If we fail to generate sufficient cash flow from future operations to meet our debt service obligations, we may need to seek refinancing of all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations with respect to our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms or at all. We depend on loans and cash management services from banks to operate our business. If banks decide to stop making loans and/or providing cash management services to companies in our industry, it could have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We depend on borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund advances, capital expenditures to build new centers and other needs. If our current or potential credit banks decide not to lend money to companies in our industry, we could face higher borrowing costs, limitations on our ability to grow our business as well as possible cash shortages, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Certain banks have notified us and other companies in the payday cash advance and check-cashing industries that they will no longer maintain bank accounts for these companies due to reputational risks and increased compliance costs of servicing money services businesses and other cash intensive industries. While none of our larger depository banks have requested that we close our bank accounts or put other restrictions on how we use their services, if any of our larger current or future depository banks were to take such action, we could face higher costs of managing our cash and limitations on our ability to grow our business, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business is seasonal in nature, which causes our revenues, collection rates and earnings to fluctuate. These fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stock price. Our business is seasonal due to the impact of fluctuating demand for advances and fluctuating collection rates throughout the year. Demand has historically been highest in the third and fourth quarters of each year, corresponding to the back-to-school and holiday seasons, and lowest in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to our customers' receipt of income tax refunds. Typically, our provision for doubtful accounts and allowance for doubtful accounts are lowest as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to our customers' receipt of income tax refunds, and increase as a percentage of revenues for the remainder of each year. This seasonality requires us to manage our cash flows over the course of the year. If our revenues or collections were to fall substantially below what we would normally expect during certain periods, our ability to service our debt, pay dividends on our common stock, repurchase our common stock and meet our other liquidity requirements may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stock price. In addition, our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future because of the seasonal nature of our business. Therefore, our quarterly revenues and results of operations are difficult to forecast, which in turn could cause our future quarterly results to not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors. Our failure to meet expectations could cause a material drop in the market price of our common stock. 25 Because we maintain a significant supply of cash in our centers, we may be subject to cash shortages due to employee and third-party theft and errors. We also may be subject to liability as a result of crimes at our centers. Because our business requires us to maintain a significant supply of cash in each of our centers, we are subject to the risk of cash shortages resulting from employee and third-party theft and errors. Although we have implemented various programs to reduce these risks, maintain insurance coverage for theft and provide security for our employees and facilities, we cannot assure you that employee and third-party theft and errors will not occur. Cash shortages from employee and third-party theft and errors were approximately $2.4 million (0.34% of total revenues) in 2007, $2.0 million (0.29% of total revenues) in 2006 and $1.6 million (0.25% of total revenues) in 2005. The extent of these cash shortages could increase as we expand the nature and scope of our products and services. Theft and errors could lead to cash shortages and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. It is also possible that crimes such as armed robberies may be committed at our centers. We could experience liability or adverse publicity arising from such crimes. For example, we may be liable if an employee, customer or bystander suffers bodily injury, emotional distress or death. Any such event may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any disruption in the availability of our information systems could adversely affect operations at our centers. We rely upon our information systems to manage and operate our centers and business. Each center is part of an information network that is designed to permit us to maintain adequate cash inventory, reconcile cash balances on a daily basis and report revenues and expenses to our headquarters. Our back-up systems and security measures could fail to prevent a disruption in our information systems. Any disruption in our information systems could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our centralized headquarters functions are susceptible to disruption by catastrophic events, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our headquarters building is located in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Our information systems and administrative and management processes are primarily provided to our zone and regional management and to our centers from this centralized location, and they could be disrupted if a catastrophic event, such as a tornado, power outage or act of terror, destroyed or severely damaged our headquarters. Any of these catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Potential future acquisitions could be difficult to integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may consider acquisitions of companies, technologies and products that we feel could accelerate our ability to compete or allow us to enter new markets. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including: Â•difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, accounting and personnel; Â•difficulties in supporting and transitioning customers of our acquired companies; Â•diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations; Â•risks of entering new markets; 26 Â•potential loss of key employees; and Â•inability to generate sufficient revenues to offset acquisition costs. Acquisitions also frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to potential impairments in the future that could harm our financial results. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted, which could affect the market price of our stock. If we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regular turnover among our managers and employees at our centers makes it more difficult for us to operate our centers and increases our costs of operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As of December 31, 2007, the annual turnover among our center managers was approximately 58% and among our other center employees was approximately 120%. Approximately 50% of the turnover has traditionally occurred in the first six months following the hire date of our center managers and employees. This turnover increases our cost of operations and makes it more difficult to operate our centers. If we are unable to retain our employees in the future, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our executive officers and directors may be able to exert significant influence over our future direction. As of February 29, 2008, our executive officers and directors, together with certain family members and trusts for their benefit, controlled approximately 27% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if they act together, may be able to influence any matter requiring our stockholders' approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. As a result, this concentration of ownership may delay, prevent or deter a change in control, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company or its assets and might reduce the market price of our common stock. We can redeem your common stock if you are or if you become a disqualified person. Federal and state laws and regulations applicable to providers of payday cash advance services or other financial products or services that we may introduce in the future may now or in the future restrict direct or indirect ownership or control of providers of such products or services by disqualified persons (such as convicted felons). Our certificate of incorporation provides that we may redeem shares of your common stock to the extent deemed necessary or advisable, in the sole judgment of our Board of Directors, to prevent the loss of, or to secure the reinstatement or renewal of, any license or permit from any governmental agency that is conditioned upon some or all of the holders of our common stock possessing prescribed qualifications or not possessing prescribed disqualifications. The redemption price will be the average closing sale price per share of our common stock during the 20-trading-day period ending on the second business day preceding the redemption date fixed by our Board of Directors. At the discretion of our Board of Directors, the redemption price may be paid in cash, debt or equity securities or a combination of cash and debt or equity securities. ITEM 1B.
