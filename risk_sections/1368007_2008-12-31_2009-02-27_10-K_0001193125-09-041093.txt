ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to Our Industry We face intense competition and compete globally with a broad range of market participants for listings and trading volumes. Our industry is highly competitive. We face significant competition for listings and trading of cash equities, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, structured products, futures, options and other derivatives. We expect competition in our industry to intensify. Increased competition from existing and new competitors could cause our exchanges to experience a decline in their share of listing and trading activity. Such a decline would mean that we would lose the associated transaction fees and proportionate share of market data fees, and could have increased pressure on our fee levels in order to remain competitive. Recent trends towards the liberalization and globalization of world capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital, greater international participation in local markets and more competition among markets in different geographical areas. As a result, global competition among listing venues, trading markets and other execution venues has become more intense. In addition, in the last several years the structure of the exchange sector has changed significantly through industry consolidation and demutualizations (in which an exchange converts from member ownership to for-profit status), trends that have contributed to a more intense competitive environment. Our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include both traditional and non-traditional trading venues. These include regulated markets, electronic communications networks and other alternative trading systems, market makers, banks, brokers and other financial market participants. Some of these competitors are also among our largest customers. Regulatory changes enacted in the EU in 2007 facilitated the entry into our markets of MTFs that operate on a pan-European basis. In addition to increased competition from MTFs, we face significant and growing competition from financial institutions that have the ability to divert trading volumes from us. For example, banks and brokers may assume the role of principal and act as counterparty to orders originating from their customers, thus internalizing order flow that would otherwise be transacted on one of our exchanges. Banks and brokers may also enter into bilateral trading arrangements by matching their order flows, depriving our exchanges of potential trading volumes. We expect to face competition from new entrants into our markets, such as new MTFs and new initiatives sponsored by existing market participants such as banks and liquidity providers. We compete with other market participants in a variety of ways, including the cost, quality and speed of trade execution, market liquidity, the functionality, ease of use and performance of trading systems, the range of products and services offered to customers and listed companies, technological innovation and reputation. Our competitors may:  respond more quickly to competitive pressures, particularly if they are not subject to the same degree of regulatory oversight as we are;  develop products and services that are preferred by our customers;  price their products and services more competitively in order to gain market share;  develop and expand their network infrastructure and service offerings more efficiently;  utilize faster, more efficient technology;  consolidate and form alliances, which may give their markets greater liquidity, lower costs and better pricing than we will be able to offer;  market, promote and sell their products and services more effectively; and  better leverage their relationships with customers and alliance partners or better exploit brand names to market and sell their services. 25 Table of Contents Many of our current and prospective competitors have greater financial resources than we do, and many are subject to less burdensome regulation than we face. See Risks Relating to RegulationWe may face competitive disadvantages if we do not receive necessary regulatory approvals for new business initiatives. If we fail to compete successfully, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. For more information on the competitive environment in which we operate, see Item 1BusinessCompetition. Our industry is characterized by intense price competition. Our industry is characterized by intense price competition. The pricing model for trade execution for equity securities has changed in response to competitive market conditions. Some of our competitors have recently lowered the fees that they charge and increased the liquidity payments (or rebates) they provide as an incentive for providers of liquidity in certain markets. In addition, we face price competition in the fees that we charge to list securities on our exchanges. It is likely that we will continue to experience significant pricing pressures, including as a result of continuing consolidations, and that some of our competitors will seek to increase their share of trading or listings by further reducing their transaction fees, by offering larger liquidity payments or by offering other forms of financial or other incentives. Our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of these factors. For example, we could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to effectively compete on price, or our profit margins could decline if we reduce pricing in response. In addition, our competitors have in the past and may in the future engage in aggressive pricing strategies. Some competitors, especially those outside of the United States, have high profit margins in business areas in which we do not engage, which may enable them to execute these strategies. This environment could lead to loss of order flow and decreased revenues, and consequently could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Current economic conditions could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. General economic conditions affect the overall level of trading activity and new listings in securities markets. As a result, our operations are directly affected by worldwide economic conditions and economic conditions prevailing in our markets. A significant portion of our revenue depends, either directly or indirectly, on transaction-based fees that, in turn, depend on our ability to attract and maintain order flow, both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers. Adverse economic conditions may result in a decline in trading volume and demand for market data and a deterioration of the economic welfare of our listed companies, which may adversely affect our revenues and future growth. Declines in volumes may impact our market share or pricing structures. Poor economic conditions may also negatively impact new listings by reducing the number or size of securities offerings. We also generate a significant portion of our revenues from listing fees, although this revenue has been declining in recent years. Poor economic conditions, industry-specific circumstances, capital market trends and regulatory requirements may also negatively impact new listings by reducing the number or size of securities offerings. Recent global market and economic conditions have been difficult and volatile, in particular for financial services companies that are our most significant customers. While volatile markets can generate increased transaction volume, prolonged recessionary conditions can adversely affect trading volumes and the demand for market data, and can lead to slower collections of accounts receivable as well as increased counterparty risk. In the event of a significant and sustained decline in trading volumes, we would lose revenue, and our inability to quickly reduce infrastructure and overhead expenses would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, we have experienced a decline in new listings and an increase in delistings of companies that no longer satisfy our continued listing standards, and these trends may continue. 26 Table of Contents Risks Relating to Our Business Our share of trading in NYSE-listed securities has declined and may continue to decline. As a result of increasing competition, our share of trading on a matched basis in NYSE-listed securities has declined from approximately 60.5% in 2007 to 45.6% in 2008. If our trading share continues to decrease relative to our competitors, we may be less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity. This could further accelerate our loss of trading volume. Similarly, a lower trading share of NYSE-listed securities may cause issuers to question the value of an NYSE listing, which could adversely impact our listing business. If growth in our overall trading volume of NYSE-listed securities does not offset any significant decline in our trading share, or if a decline in our trading share in NYSE-listed securities makes the NYSEs market appear less liquid, then our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, in the United States, the allocation of market data revenues among competing market centers is tied to trading share. A decline in NYSE trading share lowers the percentage of the NMS tape pool revenues from the Consolidated Tape Association and Unlisted Trading Privileges that NYSE keeps. Declines in our trading share could also adversely affect the growth, viability and importance of some of our market data products. Our share of trading in Euronext-listed securities has declined and may continue to decline. In Europe, MiFID, which went into effect in November 2007, promoted competition from alternative trading platforms, or MTFs. Subsequently, a number of MTFs have been launched, or will be launched during 2009. These platforms offer trading in the securities listed on Euronext and other European regulated markets and compete directly with us for market share. In 2008 our European execution business experienced a decline of 15% in market share and this decline may continue in 2009. If our trading share continues to decrease relative to our competitors, we may be less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity. This could further accelerate our loss of trading volume. If growth in our overall trading volume of Euronext-listed securities does not offset any significant decline in our trading share, or if a decline in our trading share in Euronext-listed securities makes the Euronext market appear less liquid, then our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. Broad market trends and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our services and harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Our business, financial condition and operating results are highly dependent upon the levels of activity on our exchanges, and in particular upon the volume of financial instruments traded, the number and shares outstanding of listed issuers, the number of new listings, the number of traders in the market and similar factors. We have no direct control over these variables. Among other things, we depend more upon the relative attractiveness of the financial instruments traded on our exchanges, and the relative attractiveness of the exchanges as a market on which to trade these financial instruments, as compared to other exchanges and trading platforms. These variables are in turn influenced by economic, political and market conditions in the United States, Europe and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control, including those described under Risks Relating to Our IndustryCurrent economic conditions could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results and factors such as:  broad trends in business and finance, including industry-specific circumstances, capital market trends and the mergers and acquisitions environment;  terrorism and war;  concerns over inflation and the level of institutional or retail confidence;  changes in government monetary policy and foreign currency exchange rates;  the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital; 27 Table of Contents  the availability of alternative investment opportunities;  changes in the level of trading activity;  changes and volatility in the prices of securities;  changes in tax policy;  the level and volatility of interest rates;  legislative and regulatory changes, including the potential for regulatory arbitrage among U.S. and non-U.S. markets if significant policy differences emerge among markets;  the perceived attractiveness, or lack of attractiveness, of the U.S. capital markets;  the perceived attractiveness, or lack of attractiveness, of the European capital markets; and  unforeseen market closures or other disruptions in trading. If levels of activity on our exchanges are adversely affected by any of the factors described above or other factors beyond our control, then our business, financial condition and operating results could also be adversely affected. Current economic conditions could make it difficult for us to finance our operations. Companies in many different industries have recently found it difficult to borrow money from banks and other lending sources, and have also experienced difficulty raising funds in the capital markets. Continued instability in the financial markets, as a result of recession or otherwise, may affect our cost of capital and our ability to raise capital. Our ability to raise financing could be impaired if rating agencies, lenders or investors develop a negative perception of our long-term or short-term financial prospects, or of prospects for our industry. Although we do not currently anticipate substantial difficulties in accessing the bank lending and debt capital markets when needed, if difficult market conditions continue we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all. If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually, and are also tested when factors arise that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our businesses. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. For instance, in 2008 we recorded a $1,590 million non-cash charge, primarily for the impairment of certain goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, driven by adverse equity market conditions that caused a material decline in industry market multiples in the latter part of 2008, and lower estimated future cash flows of our European cash reporting unit as a result of increased competition which has caused a decline in our market share of cash trading in Europe, as well as pricing pressures following the November 2007 introduction of MiFID. See Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsImpairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Assets. If additional impairment charges are incurred, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. 28 Table of Contents We face foreign currency exchange rate risk and other market risks. Since we conduct operations in several different countries, including the United States and several European countries, substantial portions of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, euros and pounds sterling. Because our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in currency exchange rates can materially affect our reported results. We may also experience other market risks, including changes in interest rates and in prices of marketable equity securities that we own. We may use derivative financial instruments to reduce certain of these risks. If our strategies to reduce these market risks are not successful, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. Any strategic transactions that we undertake may require significant resources, result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities or fail to deliver anticipated benefits. We have in the past and may continue to enter into business combination transactions, make acquisitions and enter into partnerships, joint ventures and other strategic investments or alliances, some of which may be material. The market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive, particularly in light of increasing consolidation in the exchange sector and existing or potential future restrictions on foreign direct investments in some countries. Market conditions may limit our ability to use our stock as an acquisition currency. In addition, our bylaws require acquisitions, mergers and consolidations involving more than 30% of our aggregate equity market capitalization or value (or, under certain circumstances, transactions involving an entity whose principal place of business is outside of the United States and Europe) to be approved by two-thirds of our directors. These and other factors may adversely affect our ability to identify acquisition targets or strategic partners consistent with our objectives, or may make us less attractive as an acquiror or strategic partner. We cannot be sure that we will complete any business combination, acquisition, partnership, joint venture or strategic investment or alliance that we announce. Completion of these transactions is usually subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, over which we have limited or no control. Even if we do succeed in completing a transaction, the process of integration may produce unforeseen operating difficulties and expenses and may absorb significant attention of management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of the business. In addition, in connection with any such transaction, we may issue shares of our stock that dilute our existing stockholders, expend cash, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or incur other expenses, any of which could harm our business, financial condition or operating results. We cannot be sure that we will recognize the anticipated benefits of any transaction we undertake, such as any expected cost savings, growth opportunities, synergies or improvements in our competitive profile. For example, we previously announced that we expect the combination of the NYSE Group and Euronext to achieve $250 million in annualized run rate cost savings by the fourth quarter of 2010 and that we expect the acquisition of NYSE Amex to achieve annualized run-rate cost savings in excess of $100 million by the end of 2009. While we fully expect to achieve these cost savings and synergies, there can be no assurance that we will achieve these savings and synergies in the time currently expected, or at all. A variety of factors, including unanticipated difficulties integrating our existing technology platforms onto our UTP, regulatory changes, competitive developments, labor conflicts and litigation, currency fluctuations and inflation, may adversely affect any anticipated cost savings, revenue potential or other anticipated benefits. The anticipated benefits of a particular transaction may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected. We cannot direct the actions of strategic partners or joint ventures that we do not control. We are generally unable to cause dividends or distributions to be made to us from the entities in which we have a minority investment or to direct the management of such entities. Some of our investments may entail particular risks, including the possibility that a partner, majority investor or co-venturer may have different interests or goals, and may take action contrary to our instructions, requests, policies or business objectives, any and all of which could adversely impact our brand name and reputation. Also, our minority positions generally will be illiquid due to 29 Table of Contents regulatory impediments to sale or because the market for them is limited. If we are unable to successfully maximize the benefits of our strategic investments and joint ventures, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. We face risks when entering into or increasing our presence in markets where we do not currently compete or entering into new business lines. We may enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry. Attracting customers in certain countries may also be subject to a number of risks, including currency exchange rate risk, difficulties in enforcing agreements or collecting receivables, longer payment cycles, compliance with the laws or regulations of these countries, and political and regulatory uncertainties. We may also enter into newly developing arenas of competition, such as MTFs in Europe, where less regulated competitors exist and demand for such services is subject to uncertainty. As a result, demand and market acceptance for our products and services within these markets will be subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk. We may be unable to enter into or increase our presence in these markets and compete successfully. We also expect to expand into the commercial technology business as a part of our business strategy. Our experience in this line of business is limited and demand and market acceptance for our products and services within this line of business will be subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk and we may be unable to compete successfully with more experienced market participants. Our business may be adversely affected by risks associated with clearing activities. Our U.K. regulated derivatives subsidiary, the London Market of NYSE Liffe, is expected to take full responsibility for clearing activities in our London derivatives market during the first half of 2009, subject to regulatory approval. As a result, the London Market of NYSE Liffe will become the central counterparty for contracts entered into by its clearing members on the NYSE Liffe market and will outsource certain services to LCH.Clearnet through the NYSE Liffe Clearing arrangement. NYSE Liffe will have credit exposure to those clearing members. NYSE Liffes clearing members may encounter economic difficulties as a result of the market turmoil and tightening credit markets, including bankruptcy and failure. NYSE Liffe will offset its credit exposure through arrangements with LCH.Clearnet in which LCH.Clearnet will provide clearing guarantee backing and related risk functions to NYSE Liffe, and under which LCH.Clearnet will be responsible for any defaulting member positions and for applying its resources to the resolution of such a default. In addition, NYSE Liffe will maintain policies and procedures to help ensure that its clearing members can satisfy their obligations, including by requiring members to meet minimum capital and net worth requirements and to deposit collateral for their trading activity. Nevertheless, we cannot be sure that in extreme circumstances, LCH.Clearnet might not itself suffer difficulties, in which case these measures might not prove sufficient to protect NYSE Liffe from a default, or might fail to ensure that NYSE Liffe is not materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default. We may also in the future expand our clearing operations to other markets and financial products, which would increase our exposure to these types of risks. See Item 1BusinessProducts and ServicesOrder ExecutionEuropeDerivatives TradingClearing and Settlement. We operate in a business environment that continues to experience significant and rapid technological change. Technology is a key component of our business strategy, and we regard it as crucial to our success. We seek to offer market participants a comprehensive suite of best-in-class technology solutions in a centralized environment, including successfully transitioning to our UTP on a global basis and implementing our global data center strategy. However, we operate in a business environment that has undergone, and continues to experience, significant and rapid technological change. In recent years, electronic trading has grown significantly, and customer demand for increased choice of execution methods has increased. To remain competitive, we must 30 Table of Contents continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, capacity, accessibility and features of our trading platforms, software, systems and technologies. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to:  develop and license leading technologies;  enhance existing trading platforms and services and creating new platforms and services;  respond to customer demands, technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis; and  continue to attract and retain highly skilled technology staff to maintain and develop existing technology and to adapt to and manage emerging technologies. The development and expansion of electronic trading and market data related technologies entail significant technological, financial and business risks. Any failure or delay in exploiting technology, or failure to exploit technology as effectively as competitors, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. The adoption of new technologies or market practices may require us to devote additional resources to improve and adapt our services. For example, the growth of algorithmic and so called black box trading requires us to increase systems and network capacity to ensure that increases in message traffic can be accommodated without adverse effect on system performance. Keeping pace with these ever increasing requirements can be expensive, and we cannot be sure that we will succeed in making these improvements to our technology infrastructure in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services, products and technologies on a timely and cost-effective basis and to adapt to technological advancements and changing standards, we may be unable to compete effectively, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, we may incur substantial development, sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort to add new products or services to our trading platforms. Even after incurring these costs, we ultimately may not realize any, or may realize only small amounts of, revenues for these new products or services. Consequently, if revenue does not increase in a timely fashion as a result of these expansion initiatives, the up-front costs associated with expansion may exceed revenue and reduce our working capital and income. Our reliance on third parties to perform certain clearing and regulatory services could adversely affect our business if these third parties fail to perform their obligations. We rely on third parties for certain clearing and regulatory services. For example, we are dependent on LCH.Clearnet to provide a clearing guarantee and manage related risk functions for NYSE Liffe in connection with clearing on our NYSE Liffe London market. We also rely on the services of Euroclear for settling transactions on our European cash markets (except in Portugal). Additionally, we have a contractual arrangement with FINRA pursuant to which FINRA performs certain regulatory functions on our behalf. To the extent that either LCH.Clearnet, Euroclear or FINRA experiences difficulties, materially changes their business relationship with us or is unable for any reason to perform their obligations, our business or our reputation may be materially adversely affected. Insufficient systems capacity and systems failures could adversely affect our business. Our business depends on the performance and reliability of complex computer and communications systems. Heavy use of our platforms and order routing systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time. Our U.S. systems capacity requirements could grow significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including changes in the NYSE market and growth in our options trading business. Our failure to maintain systems or to ensure sufficient capacity may also result in a temporary disruption of our regulatory and reporting functions. 31 Table of Contents We have experienced systems failures in the past, and it is possible that we will experience systems failures in the future. Systems failures could be caused by, among other things, periods of insufficient capacity or network bandwidth, power or telecommunications failures, acts of God or war, terrorism, human error, natural disasters, fire, sabotage, hardware or software malfunctions or defects, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events over which we have little or no control. We also rely on third parties for systems support. Any interruption in these third-party services or deterioration in the performance of these services could also be disruptive to our business. In addition, our systems may be adversely affected by failures of other trading systems, as a result of which we may be required to suspend trading activity in particular securities or, under certain circumstances, unwind trades. If we cannot expand system capacity to handle increased demand, or if our systems otherwise fail to perform and we experience disruptions in service, slower response times, or delays in introducing new products and services, then we could incur reputation damage, regulatory sanctions, litigation, loss of trading share, loss of trading volume and loss of revenues, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our networks and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks. The secure transmission of confidential information over public and other networks is a critical element of our operations. Our networks and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other security problems. Persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully access and use our information or our customers information, or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Our security measures are costly, and may prove to be inadequate. This could cause us to incur reputation damage, regulatory sanctions, litigation, loss of trading share, loss of trading volume and loss of revenues, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies. Given our position as the worlds leading market, our prominence in the global securities industry, and the concentration of many of our properties and personnel in U.S. and European financial centers, including lower Manhattan, we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of, or an indirect casualty of, attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations, or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives. It is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the securities industry generally or on our business. In the event of an attack or a threat of an attack, our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business, technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business. For example, if part or all of our primary data center facilities become inoperable, our disaster recovery and business continuity planning practices may not be sufficient and we may experience a significant delay in resuming normal business operations. For a discussion of some of our security measures and contingency plans, see Item 2PropertiesSecurity Measures and Contingency Plans. Damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage, and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all. The threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees. In addition, terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the securities markets, including trading on exchanges. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business. One of our competitive strengths is our strong reputation and brand name. Our reputation could be harmed in many different ways, including by regulatory, governance or technology failures or the activities of members or listed companies whom we do not control. Damage to our reputation could cause some issuers not to list their securities on our exchanges, as well as reduce the trading volume on our exchanges. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 32 Table of Contents The loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business. We depend upon the contributions of our senior management team and other key employees. If one or more of these executives, or other key employees, were to cease to be employed by us, we could be adversely affected. In particular, our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner. A failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, could adversely affect our business. We own or license rights to a number of trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and patents that we use in our business. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark laws, copyright laws, patent laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates, customers, strategic investors and others. The protective steps taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property. We may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, defending our intellectual property rights may require significant financial and managerial resources, the expenditure of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us, which may be costly to defend, could require the payment of damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies, trademarks or other intellectual property. Some of our competitors currently own patents and have actively been filing patent applications in recent years, some of which may relate to our trading platforms and business processes. As a result, we may face allegations that we have infringed or otherwise violated the intellectual property rights of third parties. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management resources and attention. Successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others, or require us to purchase licenses from third parties, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We are subject to significant litigation risks and other liabilities. Many aspects of our business involve litigation risks. These risks include, among others, potential liability from disputes over terms of a securities trade or from claims that a system or operational failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer, as well as potential liability from claims that we facilitated an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction. Dissatisfied customers frequently make claims against their service providers regarding quality of trade execution, improperly settled trades, mismanagement or even fraud. Although aspects of our business are protected by regulatory immunity, we could nevertheless be exposed to substantial liability under U.S. federal and state laws and court decisions, laws and court decisions in the other countries where we operate, as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, CFTC or European and other regulators. We could incur significant expenses defending claims, even those without merit. In addition, an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. For a discussion of certain legal claims against us, see Item 3Legal Proceedings. Perceptions about the legal and regulatory environment in the United States may make it difficult for us to compete with non-U.S. exchanges. Our U.S. exchanges compete for listings of securities of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies. However, the legal and regulatory environment in the United States, and market perceptions about that environment, may make it difficult for our U.S. exchanges to compete with non-U.S. exchanges for listings. For example, the Sarbanes- 33 Table of Contents Oxley Act of 2002 imposes a stringent set of corporate governance, reporting and other requirements on both U.S. and non-U.S. companies with securities listed on a U.S. exchange. Significant resources are necessary for companies to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and we believe this has had an adverse impact on the ability of our U.S. exchanges to attract and retain listings. In this regard, the number of U.S. companies that have chosen to list shares exclusively on a non-U.S. exchange has increased in recent years. At the same time, both U.S. and non-U.S. companies are increasingly seeking to access the U.S. capital markets through private transactions that do not involve listing on a U.S. exchange, such as through Rule 144A transactions directed exclusively to mutual funds, hedge funds and other large institutional investors. While our European exchanges are not subject to some of the same perceptions that exist about our U.S. exchanges, U.S. and non-U.S. companies that choose not to list on one of our U.S. exchanges may not list on a Euronext exchange. The SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board have taken steps to address some of these concerns through initiatives that include revisions to the rules relating to internal control over financial reporting established under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, rules that facilitate the delisting and deregistration of securities issued by some non-U.S. companies, and rules that exempt some non-U.S. companies from U.S. GAAP reconciliation requirements. It is unclear whether U.S. or non-U.S. companies will exhibit greater interest in accessing the U.S. public markets as a result of these changes. Moreover, the rules facilitating a non-U.S. companys ability to delist its securities and exit the U.S. public company reporting system may make it more difficult for us to retain listings of non-U.S. companies, and may diminish the perception of our U.S. exchanges as premier listing venues, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Provisions of our organizational documents and Delaware law may delay or deter a change of control. Our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control, or an acquisition proposal, that our stockholders might consider favorable. These include provisions:  vesting our board of directors with sole power to set the number of directors;  limiting the persons that may call special stockholders meetings;  limiting stockholder action by written consent;  requiring supermajority stockholder approval with respect to certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;  restricting any person (either alone or together with its related persons) from voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10% of our outstanding voting capital stock (including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock); and  restricting any person (either alone or together with its related persons) from beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20% of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. In addition, our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval. Any series of preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. The ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals, thus adversely affecting the market price of our common stock. 34 Table of Contents Finally, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Subject to specific exceptions, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the time the person became an interested stockholder, unless:  the business combination, or the transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, is approved by our board of directors prior to the time the interested stockholder attained that status;  upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding those shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and by employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or  at or after the time a person became an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. Business combinations include mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to various exceptions, in general an interested stockholder is a person that, together with his or her affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. Section 203 could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals, thus adversely affecting the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock may be volatile. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as the factors listed below, could affect the market price of our common stock:  quarterly variations in our results of operations or the results of operations of our competitors;  changes in earning estimates, investors perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts earning estimates;  the announcement of new products or service enhancements by us or our competitors;  announcements related to litigation;  potential acquisitions by us of other companies;  developments in our industry; and  general economic, market and political conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors. Risks Relating to Regulation We operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures, fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations. We operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to extensive regulation. The securities industry is subject to extensive governmental regulation and could become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny. As a matter of public policy, these regulations are designed to safeguard the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and to protect the interests of investors in those markets. The SEC and CFTC regulate our U.S. exchanges and have broad powers to audit, investigate and enforce compliance with their rules and regulations and impose sanctions for non-compliance. European regulators have similar powers with respect to our exchanges in their respective countries. As the scope of our business expands, we may also become subject to 35 Table of Contents oversight by other regulators. As a result of the current market conditions, recent nationalizations and bailouts, there might be increasing demand for more regulation and stricter oversight which could cause excessive regulatory burdens. Our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules will largely depend on our establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Both the US regulators and the European regulators are vested with broad enforcement powers over exchanges in their respective jurisdictions, including powers to censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders, prohibit an exchange from engaging in some of its operations or suspend or revoke an exchanges recognition, license or registration. In the case of actual or alleged noncompliance with regulatory requirements, our exchanges could be subject to investigations and administrative or judicial proceedings that may result in substantial penalties, including revocation of an exchanges recognition, license or registration. Any such investigation or proceeding, whether successful or unsuccessful, would result in substantial costs and diversions of resources and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We may face competitive disadvantages if we do not receive necessary or timely regulatory approvals for new business initiatives. We currently operate three U.S. registered national exchanges and one DCM. Pursuant to U.S. laws and regulations, these exchanges are responsible for regulating their member organizations through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the trading activities, business conduct and financial responsibility of their member organizations and the individuals associated with them. Changes to the rules of the U.S. registered securities exchanges are generally subject to the approval of the SEC, which publishes proposed rule changes for public comment. Changes to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws and changes to the organizational documents or rules of our U.S. exchanges, to the extent affecting the activities of these exchanges, must also be approved. We may from time to time seek to engage in new business activities, some of which may require changes to our or our U.S. exchanges organizational documents or rules. We also operate exchanges in France, Belgium, Portugal, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Regulators in each of these countries regulate exchanges through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the trading activities, business conduct and financial responsibility of such exchanges and individuals associated with them. All of our initiatives in these jurisdictions with regulatory implications must be approved by the relevant authorities in each of these countries, as well as by the coordinating bodies set up under the Euronext regulators memoranda of understanding. Changes to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws and changes to the organizational documents or rules of our European exchanges, to the extent affecting the activities of these exchanges, may also require approvals. We may from time to time seek to engage in new business activities, some of which may require changes to our or our European exchanges organizational documents or rules. Any delay or denial of a requested approval could cause us to lose business opportunities or slow our ability to integrate our different markets. Our competitive position could be significantly weakened if our competitors are able to obtain regulatory approval for new functionalities faster, or with less cost or difficulty, than we are, or if approval is not required for our competitors but is required for us. Competitors that are not registered exchanges are subject to less stringent regulation. In addition, as we seek to expand our product base, we could become subject to the oversight of additional regulatory bodies. An extraterritorial change of law may adversely affect our business and, under certain special arrangements, our rights to control a substantial portion of our assets. We operate exchanges and regulated markets in various jurisdictions and thus are subject to a variety of laws and regulations. Although we do not anticipate that there will be a material adverse application of European laws to our U.S. exchanges, or a material adverse application of U.S. laws to our European exchanges, the possibility of such an occurrence cannot be ruled out entirely. If this were to occur, and we were not able to 36 Table of Contents effectively mitigate the effects of such extraterritorial application, our affected exchanges could experience a reduction in the number of listed companies or business from other market participants, or our business could otherwise be adversely affected. In addition, in connection with obtaining regulatory approval of the merger between NYSE and Euronext, we implemented certain special arrangements consisting of two standby structures, one involving a Dutch foundation and one involving a Delaware trust. The Dutch foundation is empowered to take actions to mitigate the adverse effects of any potential changes in U.S. law that have certain extraterritorial effects on the European regulated markets of NYSE Euronext, and the Delaware trust is empowered to take actions to ameliorate the adverse effects of any potential changes in European law that have certain extraterritorial effects on our U.S. exchanges. These actions include the exercise by the foundation or the trust of potentially significant control over our European or the U.S. Operations, as the case may be. Although the Dutch foundation and the Delaware trust are required to act in our best interest, subject to certain exceptions, and any remedies implemented may be implemented only for so long as the effects of the material adverse application of law persist, we may, as a result of the exercise of such rights, be required to transfer control over a substantial portion of our business and assets to the direction of the trust or of the foundation. Any such transfer of control could adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy and operate on an integrated and global basis, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Regulatory changes or future court rulings may have an adverse impact on our ability to derive revenue from market data fees. Regulatory developments could reduce the amount of revenue that we obtain from market data fees. With respect to our U.S. exchanges, the ability to assess fees for market data products is contingent upon receiving approval from the SEC. There continue to be opposing industry viewpoints as to the extent that we should be able to charge for market data, and it is conceivable that the SEC could undertake an examination of exchange market data fees. If such an examination is conducted, and the results are detrimental to our U.S. exchanges ability to charge for market data, there could be a negative impact on our revenues. In November 2004, the SEC proposed corporate governance, transparency, oversight and ownership rules for registered national exchanges and other SROs and issued a concept release examining the efficacy of self-regulation. The concept release also solicited public comment concerning the level of market data fees, following several years of claims from some competitors and data intermediaries that market data fees and revenues are excessive. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any regulatory changes will take effect, or their impact on our business. A determination by the SEC, for example, to link market data fees to marginal costs, to take a more active role in the market data rate-setting process, or to reduce the current levels of market data fees could have an adverse effect on our market data revenues. Our European exchanges are currently authorized to sell trade information on a non-discriminatory basis at a reasonable cost. This regulatory position could be modified or interpreted by the European Commission or future European court decisions in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our European market data revenues. Conflicts of interest between our for-profit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business. We are a for-profit business with regulatory responsibilities. In some circumstances, there may be a conflict of interest between the regulatory responsibilities of certain of our exchanges and some of their respective member organizations and customers. Any failure by one of our exchanges with self-regulatory responsibility to diligently and fairly regulate its member organizations or to otherwise fulfill its regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation, prompt regulatory scrutiny and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 37 Table of Contents NYSE Regulation, our wholly-owned not-for-profit subsidiary, performs market surveillance of our SEC regulated U.S. exchanges and related enforcement activities and enforces listed company compliance with applicable standards. Similarly, Euronext is responsible for monitoring trading and enforcing Euronext rules. Conflicts of interest may exist when a for-profit entity, such as NYSE Euronext, also functions as the operator of a regulated exchange. The for-profit entitys goal of maximizing stockholder value might conflict with the exchanges responsibilities as a regulator of its member and listed companies. Conflicts also arise when a company lists its securities on an exchange that it owns. The listing of our common stock on the NYSE and Euronext could potentially create a conflict between the exchanges regulatory responsibilities to vigorously oversee the listing and trading of securities, on the one hand, and the exchanges commercial and economic interest, on the other hand. While NYSE Euronext has implemented structural protections to minimize these potential conflicts, we cannot be sure that such measures will be successful. For a discussion of some of these structural protections, see Item 1BusinessRegulationUnited StatesNYSE RegulationStructure, Organization and Governance of NYSE Regulation. Our obligation to fund NYSE Regulation limits our ability to reduce our expenses or use our cash in other ways. NYSE Regulation has undertaken to perform the regulatory functions of our SEC regulated U.S. exchanges. These exchanges are required to allocate significant resources to NYSE Regulation. In addition, no regulatory fees, fines or penalties collected by NYSE Regulation may be distributed to NYSE Euronext or any entity other than NYSE Regulation. The obligation to fund NYSE Regulation could limit our ability to reduce our expense structure, and could limit our ability to invest in or pursue other opportunities that may be beneficial to our stockholders. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS There are no material unresolved written comments that were received from the SEC staff 180 days or more before the end of our fiscal year relating to our periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act. 38 Table of Contents
