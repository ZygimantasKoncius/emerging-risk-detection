ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The risk factors identified in the cautionary statements below could cause our actual results to differ materially from those suggested in the forward-looking statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. However, these risk factors are not exhaustive, as new risks emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a predictor of actual results. Our future operating results are uncertain and may fluctuate. If we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, our stock price would likely decline. If our operating results in any future period fluctuate significantly, we may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which would likely cause the market price of our common stock to decline. It is difficult to predict the timing or amount of our revenues because:  we generate a significant percentage of our revenues from a limited number of clients;  our sales cycles can be lengthy and variable;  Thorough QTc studies are typically of large volume and of short duration; and  sponsors and CROs may unexpectedly cancel, postpone or reduce the size of clinical trials. We make decisions on operating expenses based on anticipated revenue trends and available resources. We also incur expenses educating and providing information to our client base, via consultations, without any obligation by our client to purchase our products and services. Because many of our expenses are fixed and we are committed to making a significant investment in our organization and in marketing our products and services, delays in recognizing revenues could cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period. If we 11 Table of Contents fail to generate the contract signings that we expect or the anticipated revenues from such signings, we may fail to meet financial guidance that we have provided, or may provide in the future, to the public. Failure to meet financial guidance could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and affect our ability to raise capital which could reduce our cash reserves and limit our capital spending. We depend entirely on the clinical trial market and a downturn in this market could cause our revenues and profitability to decrease. Our business depends entirely on the clinical trials that pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies conduct. Our revenues and profitability will decline if there is less competition in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical device industries, which could result in fewer products under development and decreased pressure to accelerate a product approval. Our revenues and profitability will also decline if the FDA or similar agencies in foreign countries modify their requirements, thereby decreasing the need for our services. Any other developments that adversely affect the pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical device industries generally, including product liability claims, new technologies or products or general business conditions, could also decrease the volume of our business. From time to time studies for which we contracted to provide Cardiac Safety services are delayed or postponed resulting in lower than expected revenues. Extensive governmental regulation of the clinical trial process could require costly modifications to our products, adversely affect prospective clients willingness to use our products and services and increase competition and reduce our market share. We may incur increased expenses or suffer a reduction in revenues if our products and services do not comply with applicable government regulations or if regulations allow more competition in the marketplace. Conforming our products and services to these guidelines or to future changes in regulation could substantially increase our expenses. In the United States and in foreign countries, regulatory authorities have also established other standards for conducting clinical trials leading to the approval of new products with which we must comply. We are subject to these regulations because our products and services assist sponsors and CROs in conducting trials and preparing new drug or device applications. If a regulatory authority concludes that trials were not conducted in accordance with established requirements, it may take a variety of enforcement actions depending upon the nature of the violation and the applicable country. In the United States, these measures may range from issuing a warning letter or seeking injunctive relief or civil penalties to recommending criminal prosecution, which could result in a prohibition of our continued participation in future clinical trials. Our clients and prospective clients will be less likely to use our products and services if the products and services do not comply with regulatory requirements in all countries where clinical trials are expected to take place or if we are precluded from participating in clinical trials in countries where trials will be conducted. In addition, changing regulatory requirements could provide an advantage to our competitors if our competitors are able to meet the requirements more rapidly or at lower cost. For example, in the May 12, 2005 ICH release, it was suggested that semi-automated processing of electrocardiograms may be found acceptable in certain instances. Semi-automated processing uses software algorithm-placed measurements that are later adjudicated by a cardiac specialist or physician. In addition, fully-automated processing of electrocardiograms has been used in certain studies. Fully-automated processing uses only software algorithm-placed measurements. Our manual processing includes manually derived measurements, using our on screen, high resolution caliper placement system, which are later interpreted by a cardiologist. Drug sponsors have shifted towards semi-automated processing and, in some cases, to fully-automated processing, allowing more competitors to compete with us in offering this service and, as a result, we have been forced to reduce pricing to maintain our market share. The effect of such actions has reduced our revenue and gross profit per transaction. In addition, the shift from manual processing adversely affected our results of operations in 2006 and 2007 and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations in the future. If drug sponsors shift towards fully-automated processing, our future results of operations may be adversely affected. Our failure to maintain revenue and gross profit per transaction may affect our ability to achieve growth in cardiac safety revenues and overall profitability from year to year. Our failure to show growth may also prevent us from meeting the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which would likely cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 12 Table of Contents The FDA may recommend a different approach to measure drug effects on the QT interval of an ECG which could make our systems and processes obsolete and adversely affect revenue and profitability. The FDA has provided guidance reinforcing the need for routine cardiac safety testing as well as Thorough QTc testing for all compounds entering the blood stream. This testing is accomplished by measuring the QT/QTc interval prolongation on an ECG. We function as an ECG core lab and have developed our EXPeRT® system and processes to receive the ECGs and obtain and report these measurements. It is possible that, in the future, the FDA may recommend different approaches to measuring drug effects on the QT interval which may diminish the need for an ECG core lab. This would considerably reduce the value of our existing systems and processes and would substantially decrease our revenues and profitability. We have several large clients from whom we derive substantial revenue and therefore the loss of even a few of our clients could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability. We have one client that represented approximately 24% of our total revenues for 2007, an increase from 16% of our total revenues for 2006. While no other client represented more than 10% of our 2007 revenues, our next five largest clients in the aggregate represented approximately 24% of our total revenues for 2007. If we lose all or a material amount of our revenues from any significant clients and do not replace them with revenues from new clients, our revenues will decrease and they may not be sufficient to cover our costs. We currently derive and expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues and profitability from a limited number of clients. Consolidation among our clients could cause us to lose clients, decrease the market for our products and result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability. Our client base could decline because of consolidation, and we may not be able to expand sales of our products and services to new clients. Consolidation in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries and among CROs has accelerated in recent years, and we expect this trend to continue. In addition, our profitability will suffer if we reduce our prices in response to competitive pressures without achieving corresponding reductions in our expenses. New companies or organizations that result from such consolidation may decide that our products and services are no longer needed because of their own internal processes or the use of alternative systems. As these industries consolidate, competition to provide products and services to industry participants will become more intense and the importance of establishing relationships with large industry participants will become greater. These industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services. Also, if consolidation of larger clients occurs, the combined organization may represent a larger percentage of business for us and, as a result, we are likely to rely more significantly on the combined organizations revenues to achieve expected future growth. Our failure to continue to expand our business or manage growth successfully could disrupt our business operations, increase our costs and delay implementation of our business strategies. Difficulties in managing our expected future growth could disrupt our business operations, increase our costs and delay achievement of our business goals, making it more difficult for us to maintain profitability. Our growth strategy depends on our ability to expand and improve our field sales, marketing and services organization and our operations organization, both in the United States and throughout the world. In order to grow, we will need to hire additional personnel. There are a limited number of experienced personnel with an adequate knowledge of our industry, and competition for their services is intense. In addition, we may not be able to project the rate or timing of increases, if any, in the use of our products and services accurately or to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate the increases. The expansion of our foreign operations also will require us to assimilate differences in foreign business practices, overcome language barriers and hire and retain qualified personnel abroad. 13 Table of Contents We may not be successful in competing against others providing similar products and services, which could reduce our revenues, profitability and market share. If our products and services do not achieve widespread acceptance by our clients, our revenues, profitability and market share will likely decline. Our competitors include other centralized cardiac safety laboratories, CROs, software vendors, and clinical trial data service companies. Our targeted clients may decide to choose other technology-based products and services generated internally by them or from another source. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources, greater name recognition and more extensive client bases than we do. In addition, many competitors focus their efforts on providing software or services for discrete aspects of the clinical trial process and may compare favorably to us on those discrete aspects. Further, certain drug development organizations may decide not to outsource all or a significant portion of the cardiac safety activities associated with their clinical research programs, which could reduce our revenues, profitability and market share. Our failure to establish and maintain partnerships and other strategic alliances may delay the development of our products and services, cause us to lose clients and prevent us from growing our business, any of which could also cause our stock price to decline. We have relationships with providers of clinical pharmacology services, hardware and software systems, telecommunications, web-hosting and development services, systems integration and website content that support our sales and marketing efforts by satisfying other needs of our existing clients that our solutions do not address and by providing us access to their clients as potential sources of new business. We do not generally have long-term contracts with our strategic partners, so they may cease doing business with us on relatively short notice. We may incur liability as a result of providing consulting and Cardiac Safety analysis and interpretation services. We provide consulting and centralized analysis and interpretation of ECGs in connection with our clients clinical trials. It is possible that liability may be asserted against us and the physicians who interpret the ECGs for us for failing to accurately diagnose a medical problem indicated by the ECG or for failing to disclose a medical problem to the investigator responsible for the subject being tested. If we are found liable, we may be forced to pay fines and damages and to discontinue a portion of our operations. The contractual protections included in our client contracts and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to protect us against such liability. If the protections are not adequate, our profitability would be negatively impacted and also our stock price would likely fall. The cardiac safety equipment that we own and lease could become obsolete due to technological advances or we may not be able to provide the quantity of equipment needed to service our clients. We own and lease equipment, which we provide to our clients to perform cardiac safety procedures. This equipment may become obsolete due to advances in technology and the introduction of newer equipment models prior to the time that we have fully depreciated the asset or fulfilled our lease obligations. This could result in us recording additional expense to write-off the book value or the remaining lease value of the equipment. We are also dependent on a limited number of suppliers to provide the equipment necessary to service our clients. We may lose clinical clients if adequate equipment is not available, resulting in reduced revenues and profitability. Capacity constraint or system failures could result in the loss of or liability to clients, which could reduce our revenues, increase our expenses and reduce profitability. In the past, we have been able to staff for increasing workload demands in an expeditious manner. However, there may not be a sufficient and suitable group of potential employees available if rapid growth occurs in a short period of time. If we are unable to hire suitable employees to adequately meet market demand for our services, it could affect our ability to bid on this business or to meet existing contractual turnaround times. 14 Table of Contents If our clients experience any significant level of problems with our technology, we may become liable to those clients, we may be unable to persuade our clients to change from a manual, paper-based process and we may lose clients. The success of our products and services depends on the ability to protect against:  software or hardware malfunctions that interrupt operation of our applications or cause loss of data integrity;  power loss or telecommunications failures;  overloaded systems;  human error; and  natural disasters. In addition, when we offer our software products as an application service provider, our network infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptive problems caused by our clients or other Internet users. This could also lead to delays, loss of data, interruptions or cessation of service to our clients for which we may be liable. There is no current technology that provides absolute protection against these events. In addition, we may find that the cost to develop or incorporate technology into our products that provides the maximum protection against these problems outweighs the incremental benefits of providing such enhanced protection. Our software products are complex and may contain undetected software errors, which could lead to an increase in our costs or a reduction in our revenues and profitability. The occurrence of hardware and software errors, whether caused by our solutions or another vendors products, could:  cause sales of our solutions to decrease and our revenues and profitability to decline;  cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs;  divert the attention of our technical personnel away from product development efforts; and  cause significant client relations problems. Complex software products such as those included in our technology solutions frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released. In addition, we combine our solutions with software and hardware products from other vendors. As a result, we may experience difficulty in identifying the source of an error. Rapidly changing technology may impair our ability to develop and market our solutions and cause us to become less competitive. The marketplace for our software products is increasingly driven by demands for ease of use and effective performance for end-users of the system. We depend on continued focus on product improvements in this area in order to remain competitive. Our failure to continuously offer competitive products and services could cause us to lose clients and prevent us from successfully marketing our solutions to prospective clients. As a result, our revenues and profitability would likely decline. Because our business relies on technology, we are susceptible to:  rapid technological change;  changing client needs;  frequent new product introductions; and  evolving industry standards. As the Internet, computer and software industries continue to experience rapid technological change, we must quickly modify our solutions to adapt to such changes. We must develop and introduce new or enhanced products 15 Table of Contents and services that continually meet changing market demands and that keep pace with evolving industry standards. We have experienced development delays in the past and may experience similar or more significant delays in the future. In addition, competitors may develop products superior to our solutions, which could make our products obsolete. If clinical trial sponsors and CROs do not shift from their existing paper-based methods of collecting and managing clinical trial data at investigator sites to an electronic system with centralization, we may not achieve the market penetration necessary to grow the business at expected levels. If participants conducting clinical trials are unwilling to adopt our technology solutions and new ways of conducting business, our revenues may not be sufficient to achieve our expected growth rate. Our efforts to establish a standardized, electronic process to collect, manage and analyze clinical trial and cardiac safety data are a significant departure from the traditional clinical research process. We estimate that the majority of clinical trials today use manual, paper-based data entry, management and analysis tools. Each clinical trial can involve a multitude of participants, including the sponsor, a CRO, regional site managers, investigators and patients. With so many participants involved in a clinical trial, it may be difficult to convince a sponsor or CRO to accept new methods of conducting a clinical trial. We may not be successful in persuading these participants to change the manner in which they have traditionally operated and to use our products and services. If general economic conditions worsen, potential clients may be unwilling to make large capital software purchases or commitments, which could affect our ability to maintain and/or increase license revenues and overall profitability. We have seen some resistance by potential clients in making the necessary large capital expenditure to license our software through our traditional perpetual license offering. Despite our efforts to market an annual or otherwise recurring term license, our failure to continue selling perpetual software licenses in the near term may affect our ability to achieve growth in license revenues and overall profitability from year to year. If we fail to show growth in license revenues and overall profitability, we may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which would likely cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, if we are not successful in selling recurring term licenses, we will not generate the volume of recurring revenues in the future that we are expecting. We depend on certain key executives. If we lose the services of any of these executives, our operations could be disrupted, we could incur additional expenses and our ability to expand our operations could be impeded, particularly if we are not able to recruit a suitable replacement in a timely manner. The loss of the services of one or more of our key executives could negatively affect our ability to achieve our business goals. Our future performance will depend significantly on the continued service and performance of all of our executives, particularly Dr. Joel Morganroth, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Scientific Officer, and Dr. Michael McKelvey, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We also depend on our key technical, client support, sales and other managerial employees. We believe that it would be costly and time consuming to find suitable replacements for our key employees. If we are unable to protect our proprietary technology or maintain our technological advantages, we may lose our intellectual property rights and become less competitive. If we fail to protect our intellectual property from infringement, other companies may use our intellectual property to offer competitive products at lower prices. If we fail to compete effectively against these companies, we could lose clients and experience a decline in sales of our solutions. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure. In addition, in 2004 we were issued a U.S. Patent on over 50 claims directed to various features of our EXPeRT® workflow enabled data handling technology. We also have filed continuation-in-part applications in the United States Patent and Trademark Office pursuing alternative claim coverage and pursuing claim coverage specific to enhancements in our EXPeRT® workflow enabled handling technology that is imbedded in EXPeRT® 2. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products and technology. In 16 Table of Contents addition, our U.S. Patent could be successfully challenged as invalid. Monitoring unauthorized use of our solutions is difficult and the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. If we are not able to effectively integrate our recent transactions with our historic operations, we will not achieve the improvements in revenues and profitability that we anticipate. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:  inability to achieve anticipated synergies;  unwillingness of the market to use newly-licensed technology;  difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired company;  failure of a party to perform ancillary contractual obligations related to the acquisition;  diversion of managements attention from other business concerns;  potential untimely loss of key employees of the acquired company or of us; and  risk of assuming unforeseen liabilities or becoming subject to litigation. If we are not able to integrate the operations of CCSS successfully or on a timely basis, or if the market does not embrace the IVR clinical assessments and system we licensed from HTS, we will not be able to achieve the higher revenues and profitability that we had anticipated that these transactions would allow us to generate. We cannot assure you that CCSS customers will remain as our customers in the future. Additionally, we expect to achieve a certain level of revenue from the marketing agreement with Covance. If we lose any material portion of CCSS customers or if Covance does not perform to our expectations under the marketing agreement, our revenues could be significantly reduced and we could suffer an adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Goodwill is subject to impairment which could result in a significant expense. As a result of the CCSS acquisition, we carry a significant amount of goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test at least annually. We perform the impairment test annually as of December 31 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill might be impaired. If we determine that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, we will base the measurement of any impairment on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. An impairment could result in a write-off of goodwill which would reduce our profitability in the period of the write-off. Third parties may claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, which could result in the loss of our rights, subject us to liability and divert management attention. Although we are not currently involved in any intellectual property litigation, we may be a party to litigation in the future either to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property of others. These claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability or invalidate our ownership rights in the technology used in our solutions. As a result, we may have to stop selling our solutions. Litigation, regardless of the merits of the claim or outcome, could consume a great deal of our time and money and would divert management time and attention away from our core business. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:  stop using the challenged intellectual property or selling our products or services that incorporate it;  obtain a license to use the challenged intellectual property or to sell products or services that incorporate it, which could be costly or unavailable; and 17 Table of Contents  redesign those products or services that are based on or incorporate the challenged intellectual property, which could be costly and time consuming or could adversely affect the functionality and market acceptance of our products. If we must take any of the foregoing actions, we may be unable to sell our solutions, which would substantially reduce our revenues and profitability. Third parties have made claims for damages against the Company and may continue to do so, which could result in an unfavorable settlement or judgment against us. Litigation, regardless of the merits of the claim or outcome, consumes a great deal of our time and money and often diverts management time and attention away from our core business. In addition, litigation against us could result in economic harm which could reduce our cash reserves and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Our international operations expose us to additional risks. A key element of our business strategy is to expand our international operations. We face a number of risks and expenses that are inherent in operating in foreign countries and, accordingly, our international operations may not achieve profitability consistently each year. The risks to us from our international operations include:  government regulations;  trade restrictions;  burdensome foreign taxes;  exchange rate controls and currency exchange rate fluctuations;  political and economic instability;  varying technology standards; and  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. We are subject to a variety of government regulations in the countries where we market our products and services. We currently operate in the United Kingdom through a foreign subsidiary and may operate in the future in other countries through additional foreign subsidiaries. If we form foreign subsidiaries outside of the United Kingdom, we may need to withhold taxes on earnings or other payments they distribute to us. Generally, we can claim a foreign tax credit against our federal income tax expense for these taxes. However, the United States tax laws have a number of limitations on our ability to claim that credit or to use any foreign tax losses, which could result in higher payment by us of taxes in the United States. We may also need to include our share of our foreign subsidiaries earnings in our income even if the subsidiaries do not distribute money to us. As a result, less cash would be available to us in the United States. Our global operations may involve transactions in a variety of currencies. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could reduce our reported revenues or increase our reported expenses. We currently do not utilize hedging instruments. The agreements that we sign with clients outside the United States may be governed by the laws of the countries where we provide our products and services. We may also need to resolve any disputes under these agreements in the courts or other dispute resolution forums in those countries. This could be expensive or could distract managements attention away from our core business. In the event we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting, or if these internal controls are not effective, our business and financial results may suffer. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our brand and operating results could be harmed. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, 18 Table of Contents including managements assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could also be a material adverse effect on our stock price.
