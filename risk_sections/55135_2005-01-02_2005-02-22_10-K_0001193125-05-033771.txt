Risk Factors, many of which are beyond Kellys control. These factors include actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; announcements of new services by Kelly or its competitors; announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; and changes in general economic conditions. Because of this, Kelly may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of its shareholders or of securities analysts, and its stock price could fluctuate as a result. Concentration of Ownership Terence E. Adderley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and certain trusts with respect to which he acts as trustee or co-trustee, control approximately 92.6% of outstanding Kelly Class B common stock, which is the only class of stock entitled to voting rights. Mr. Adderley is therefore able to exercise voting control of the Company with respect to matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions.
