Risk Factors. Our intellectual property protections may be inadequate. We believe that our continued success depends primarily on continuing innovation, marketing, and technical expertise, as well as the quality of product support and customer relations. At the same time, our success is partially dependent on the proprietary technology contained in our products. We currently rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our products. We cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will adequately protect our proprietary rights, that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology, or that we can maintain such technology as trade secrets. In addition, the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured, or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or at all. Furthermore, we enter into various development projects and arrangements with other companies. In some cases, these arrangements 23 allow for the sharing or use of our intellectual property. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We attempt to mitigate this risk by obtaining indemnification from others, where possible. Certain of our software (as well as that of our customers) may be derived from open source software that is generally made available to the public by its authors and/or other third parties. Such open source software is often made available to us under licenses, such as the GNU General Public License, which impose certain obligations on us in the event we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software. These obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public, or license such derivative works under a particular type of license, rather than the forms of licenses customarily used to protect our intellectual property. In the event the copyright holder of any open source software were to successfully establish in court that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work, we could be required to release the source code of that work to the public and/or stop distribution of that work. We may be unable to attract, motivate or retain key managerial and technical personnel. Our success depends to a significant degree upon the performance and continued service of key managers, as well as engineers involved in the development of our storage networking technologies and technical support of our products and customers. Competition for such highly skilled employees is intense in the communities in which we operate, as well as our industry, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in recruiting, training, and retaining such personnel. In addition, employees may leave us and subsequently compete against us, and we may incur costs relating to their departure. Also, many of these key managerial and technical personnel receive stock-based compensation incentives as part of our employee retention initiatives. The number of shares authorized under stock based plans may be insufficient and shareholders may not approve to increase the number of authorized shares. New regulations, volatility in the stock market, and other factors could diminish the value of our stock-based compensation incentives, putting us at a competitive disadvantage and forcing us to use more cash compensation. If we are unable to attract new managerial and technical employees, or are unable to retain and motivate our current key managerial and technical employees, or are forced to use more cash compensation to retain or replace key personnel, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our stock price is volatile, which has and may result in lawsuits against us and our officers and directors. The stock market in general and the stock prices of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. For example, during the twelve month period ended June 30, 2013, the sales price of our common stock ranged from a low of $5.72 per share to a high of $7.98 per share. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include, but are not limited to, the following:  Actual or alleged intellectual property infringement;  Quarterly variations in customer demand and operating results;  The gain or loss of significant customers or design wins;  Pricing pressures;  General conditions in the computer, storage, or communications markets;  Events affecting other companies that investors deem to be comparable to us;  Announcements of new products by us or our competitors;  Offers to buy us or a competitor for a premium over recent trading prices;  Changes in analysts earnings estimates;  Changes in analyst recommendations, price targets, or other parameters that may not be related to earnings estimates; 24  Rumors or dissemination of false information; and  Short selling of our common stock. In addition, a takeover proposal by any third party to acquire the outstanding shares of our common stock may result in further volatility in the price of our common stock. If a takeover does not occur following announcement of a takeover proposal, for any reason, the market price of our common stock may decline. In the past, companies, including us, that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. If we were to be the subject of similar litigation in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such litigation would also divert managements attention from other business matters. Our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such methods, estimates, and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates, and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates, and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations. See Critical Accounting Policies contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The final determination of our income tax liability may be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and international jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Additionally, our calculations of income taxes are based on our interpretations of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file. Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factors including:  Earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates;  Changes in the allocation of income and expenses related to cost sharing arrangements, including adjustments related to changes in our corporate structure, acquisitions or tax law changes;  Tax effects of increases in nondeductible compensation;  Changes in transfer pricing regulations;  Changes in domestic and foreign tax laws including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income and changes to foreign tax credit rules;  Changes in accounting rules or principles, and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities;  Unfavorable results from income tax audits; and  Expiration or lapses of federal and state research credits. We have adopted transfer-pricing procedures between our affiliated entities. Our procedures call for the licensing of intellectual property, the provision of services, and the sale of products from one affiliate to another at prices that we believe are equivalent to an arms length negotiated price. If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge our transfer pricing 25 practices resulting in adjustments for prior or future tax years, we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected. Any redetermination of income allocations or modification of transfer pricing laws could result in an income tax assessment on the portion of income deemed to be derived from the U.S. or other taxing jurisdictions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement of tax liabilities prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which, if settled unfavorably, could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other foreign, state and local tax authorities. We are currently under audit by the IRS for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and an amended return for fiscal 2007, and by the California Franchise Tax Board for fiscal years 2008 and 2009. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. We may not realize the full benefits of the New Zealand research and development grants. We are entitled to reimbursement of certain New Zealand based research and development costs through various grant programs offered by the New Zealand government that were assumed as part of our acquisition of Endace. The receipt and amount of funds under these programs are subject to our satisfaction of certain terms and conditions. As of June 30, 2013, Endace has received an aggregate of approximately $5.0 million in credits to research and development expenses and approximately $1.1 million in credits related to capital expenditures pursuant to these grants. If we do not to satisfy the terms and conditions of any of these grant programs, expenses incurred in respect of the relevant research and development projects may not be approved for reimbursement, we may be required to return amounts previously paid to us under such grant programs, and further grants may not be available to us in the future. Our corporate offices, principal product development facilities, EMS providers, suppliers and customers are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Our California facilities, which include our corporate offices and principal product development facilities, are located near major earthquake faults. Any disruption in our business activities, personal injury, or damage to the facilities in excess of our currently insured amounts as a result of earthquakes or other such natural disasters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis, flooding, and earthquakes, such as the flooding in Thailand in October 2011 and the earthquake off the coast of Japan and the resulting tsunami in March 2011, could disrupt manufacturing operations of our EMS providers, component suppliers and customers or the downstream suppliers that are located in such impacted areas, resulting in lost revenue opportunities in the near term and/or long term. We currently do not carry earthquake or flood insurance. However, we do carry various other lines of insurance that may or may not be adequate to protect our business in the case of a natural disaster. Our certificate of incorporation and the related provisions under Delaware law could adversely affect the performance of our stock. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. In addition, although we do not currently maintain a shareholders rights plan, we have maintained such a plan in the past and it is possible that we may adopt a shareholders rights plan in the future should general business, market or other conditions, opportunities and risks arise. The provisions of our certificate of incorporation, Delaware law, and any shareholders rights plan are generally intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow our Board of Directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing 26 shareholder value. However, such provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. We may be subject to theft or misuse of our electronic data, which could result in third-party claims and harm our business and results of operations. We may experience attempts by others that try to gain unauthorized access through the Internet to our information technology systems, such as when they masquerade as authorized users or surreptitiously introduce software. These attempts, which might be the result of industrial or other espionage, or actions by hackers seeking to harm us, our products, or our end users. We seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such cyber threats could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce marketplace acceptance of our products; the value of our investment in research and development and marketing could be reduced; and third parties might assert against us or our customers claims related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information or end-user data, or system reliability. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our system of internal controls may be inadequate. We maintain a system of internal controls in order to ensure we are able to collect, process, summarize, and disclose the information required by the Securities and Exchange Commission within the time periods specified. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Due to these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Additionally, public companies in the United States are required to review their Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting (ICOFR) under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If our ICOFR are not adequate or fail to perform as anticipated, we may be required to restate our financial statements, receive an adverse audit opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, or take other actions that will divert significant financial and managerial resources, as well as subject us to fines or other government enforcement actions. Furthermore, the price of our stock could be adversely affected. We may need additional capital in the future and such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms. While we believe we have adequate working capital to meet our expected cash requirements for the next 12 months, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in the future for various purposes, including:  Acquisitions of or strategic investments in complementary businesses or technologies;  International expansion;  Development of new products or services;  Unanticipated competitive pressures; and  Unexpected tax or litigation costs and settlements. Any additional financing we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of business opportunities, develop new products or services, or otherwise respond to unanticipated competitive pressures. In any such case, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Changes in laws, regulations, and financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations. As our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose 27 securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, SEC and NYSE, have implemented requirements and regulations and continue developing additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by Congress, most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue resulting in, increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. A change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements, such as the increased use of fair value measures, proposed changes to revenue recognition, lease accounting, financial instruments and other accounting standards, and the potential requirement that U.S. registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. Implementation of accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies, particularly those related to revenue and expense recognition, could cause us to defer revenue recognition or accelerate the timing of expense recognition, which would adversely affect our reported financial results, and could have an adverse effect on our stock price. As new and modified laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations due in part to their lack of specificity, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. Global warming issues may cause us to alter the way we conduct our business. The general public is becoming more aware of global warming issues, and as a result, governments around the world are beginning to focus on addressing this issue. This may result in new environmental regulations that may unfavorably impact us, our suppliers, and our customers in how we conduct our business including the design, development, and manufacturing of our products. The cost of meeting these requirements may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None.
