ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to other information referenced in this report, we are subject to a number of specific risks outlined below. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the market price of our common stock could be materially affected. CHANGES AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S SPENDING PRIORITIES COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FUTURE REVENUE AND GROWTH PROSPECTS. Our primary customers, which compose a substantial portion of our revenue and backlog, include agencies of the U.S. federal government and state and local governments and agencies that depend on funding or partial funding provided by the U.S. federal government. Consequently, any significant changes and fluctuations in the government's spending priorities as a result of policy changes or economic downturns may directly affect our future revenue streams. Additionally, reduced spending by the U.S. government may create competitive pressure within our industry which could result in lower revenues and margins in the future. 8 OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, TRAIN, AND RETAIN PROFESSIONAL PERSONNEL OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY IS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. OUR FUTURE INABILITY TO DO SO WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVENESS. Our contract obligations in our engineering and energy markets are performed by our staff of well-qualified engineers, technical professionals, and management personnel. Our future growth potential requires the effective attraction, training, and retention of these employees. Our inability to retain these well-qualified personnel and recruit additional well-qualified personnel would adversely affect our business performance and limit our ability to perform new contracts. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE WORK WE PERFORM TO COMPLETE ENGINEERING AND ENERGY CONTRACTS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CONTRACT DISPUTES. Our engineering and energy contracts often involve large projects where design, construction, or systems failures could result in substantially large or punitive damages for which we could have liability. We maintain insurance coverage through various policies which are intended to reduce our financial exposure to any potential liabilities or future claims. We may also experience a delay or withholding of payment for services due to performance disputes. If we are unable to resolve these disputes and collect these payments, we would incur profit reductions and reduced cash flows. WE ARE SUBJECT TO PROCUREMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. IF WE DO NOT COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE MAY BE PROHIBITED FROM COMPLETION OF OUR EXISTING GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS OR SUSPENDED FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING AND SUBCONTRACTING FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. Our compliance with the laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of these contracts is dependent upon our ability to ensure that we properly design and execute compliant procedures. Our termination from any of our larger government contracts or suspension from future government contracts for any reason would result in material declines in expected revenue. WE ARE SUBJECT TO ROUTINE U.S. GOVERNMENT AUDITS RELATED TO OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. IF AUDIT FINDINGS ARE UNFAVORABLE, WE COULD EXPERIENCE A REDUCTION IN OUR PROFITABILITY. Our government contracts are subject to audit by the U.S. government. These audits may result in the determination that certain costs claimed as reimbursable are not allowable or have not been properly allocated to government contracts according to federal government regulations. We are subject to audits for several years after payment for services has been received. Based on these audits, the U.S. government may adjust or seek reimbursement for previously paid amounts. As a result, we could experience negative effects to our revenue, profits, and cash flow. WE ARE SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE ECONOMIC CYCLES. A WEAKENING OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES MAY RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN OUR REVENUES, PROFITS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. Our engineering and energy services are affected by the overall level of economic activity within our target markets. Economic activity is subject to volatility that is due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control. Our private and government clients may change spending priorities due to economic downturns. Additionally, downturns may result in delayed or failed payments by some customers as well as delays in committing to new contracts. 9 OUR INABILITY TO CONTINUE TO WIN OR RENEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL REDUCTIONS IN OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS. We have increased our contract activity with the U.S. federal government in recent years. If our relationship or reputation with the federal government deteriorates for any reason and affects our ability to win new contracts or renew existing ones, we could experience a material revenue decline. OUR INVOLVEMENT IN PARTNERSHIPS EXPOSES US TO ADDITIONAL LEGAL AND MARKET REPUTATION DAMAGES. Our methods of service delivery include partnerships and other ventures. If our partners fail to perform in a satisfactory and timely manner, we may be exposed to claims for damages that are a result of a partner's performance. We could also suffer contract termination and damages to our reputation as a result of a partner's performance. WE ARE ENGAGED IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS THAT POSE CHALLENGES TO CONTINUED REVENUE GROWTH. Our business is characterized by competition for contracts within the government and private sectors in which service contracts are typically awarded through competitive bidding processes. We compete with a large number of other service providers who offer the principal services we offer. In this competitive environment, we must provide technical proficiency, quality of service, and experience to ensure future contract awards and revenue and profit growth. OUR DEPENDENCE ON OTHER CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS INCREASES PROFIT UNCERTAINTY FOR OUR INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS. Our service delivery model frequently includes subcontracts, joint ventures, and other contractual agreements with other contractors and subcontractors when bidding for and completing projects. If our partners are unable to provide quality services in a timely manner, our ability to perform the contracted services and meet expected profit levels could be compromised. OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO UNIQUE RISKS AND CHALLENGES THAT CREATE INCREASED UNCERTAINTY IN THESE MARKETS. Our international operations are subject to unique risks. These risks can include: potentially dynamic political and economic environments; civil disturbances, unrest, or violence; volatile labor conditions due to strikes and general difficulties in staffing international operations with highly qualified personnel; and logistical and communication challenges. We also could be subject to exposure to liability due to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. OUR GOODWILL OR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS COULD BECOME IMPAIRED AND RESULT IN A MATERIAL REDUCTION IN OUR PROFITS. We have made acquisitions which have resulted in the recording of goodwill and intangible assets within our organization. If these assets become impaired, a material write-off in the required amount would lead to reductions in our profits. WE USE "PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION" ACCOUNTING METHODS FOR MANY OF OUR PROJECTS. THIS METHOD MAY RESULT IN VOLATILITY IN STATED REVENUES AND PROFITS. Our revenues and profits for many contracts are recognized ratably over the life of those contracts as work is performed. This rate is based primarily on the proportion of labor costs incurred to date to total labor costs projected to be incurred for the entire project. The potential for material profit revisions exists should the total labor cost to complete a project or percentage of the project that is completed be inaccurately estimated. 10 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS With respect to comments received from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission on our periodic and current reports required under the Securities Act of 1933, no staff comments currently remain unresolved.
