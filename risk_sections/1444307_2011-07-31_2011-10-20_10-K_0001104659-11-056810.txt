ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this Report in evaluating our business and our prospects. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected by a wide range of factors.. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business financial condition, results of operations and stock price. We must raise additional capital in order to continue operating our business, and such additional funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. We do not generate any cash from operations and must raise additional funds in order to continue operating our business. Since inception we have funded our operations primarily through equity and debt financings and we expect to continue to do so in the future. As further described elsewhere in this report, on June 24, 2011, we issued 4 million shares of common stock and three series of warrants to purchase an aggregate of 12 million shares of our common stock to two institutional investors for proceeds of $3.0 million (the June Private Placement). However, we will require additional financing to fund our planned operations, including developing and commercializing the assets obtained under the Asset Purchase Agreement with Inovio, seeking to license or acquire new assets, researching and developing any potential patents, related compounds and other intellectual property, funding potential acquisitions, and supporting clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval relating to our assets and any assets we may acquire in the future. Additional financing may not be available to us when needed or, if available, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we may be forced to delay or scale down some or all of our development activities or perhaps even cease the operation of our business. If we issue equity or convertible debt securities to 10 Table of Contents raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we incur additional debt, it may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization, requiring us to pay additional interest expenses. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, would increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. We may not be able to obtain additional financing if the volatile conditions in the capital and financial markets, and more particularly the market for early development stage biomedical company stocks, persist. Weak economic and capital markets conditions could result in increased difficulties in raising capital for our operations. We may not be able to raise money through the sale of our equity securities or through borrowing funds on terms we find acceptable. If we cannot raise the funds that we need, we will be unable to continue our operations, and our stockholders could lose their entire investment in our company. We have never generated revenue from our operations and our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have not generated any revenue from operations since our incorporation. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2010, we incurred a net loss of $36,158 and during the annual period ended July 31, 2011, we incurred a net loss of $3,758,817. From inception through July 31, 2011, we incurred an aggregate loss of $3,835,876. We expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially over the next 12 months as we ramp-up our business. We estimate our average monthly expenses over the next 12 months to be approximately $400,000, including general and administrative expenses but excluding future acquisition costs and the cost of any future development activities. As of July 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,457,693. Although we have obtained some of the funds we expect to require in the June Private Placement, after deducting for fees and expenses, our aggregate net cash proceeds from the June Private Placement was approximately $2.79 million. In order to fund our anticipated budget for the next 12 months, including acquisition costs, we believe that we will need to raise approximately $2.3 million in additional funds. This amount could increase if we encounter unanticipated difficulties. In addition, our estimates of the amount of cash necessary to fund our business and development and commercialization activities may prove to be wrong, and we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently expect. If we cannot raise the money that we need in order to continue to develop our business, we will be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our proposed operations. If any of these were to occur, there is a substantial risk that our business would fail. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, as described in the explanatory paragraph to our independent auditors report on our financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2011, which are included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2011, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on October 19, 2011. Although our financial statements raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, they do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue our business. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosure describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors. We are an early-stage company with a limited operating history, which may hinder our ability to successfully meet our objectives. We are an early-stage company with only a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our current business and future prospects and how we will respond to competitive, financial or technological challenges. Only recently have we explored opportunities in the biomedical industry. As a result, the revenue and income potential of our business is unproven. In addition, because of our limited operating history, we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. Errors may be made in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends and we will be subject to the risks, uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by early-stage companies in evolving markets. We may not be able to successfully address any or all of these risks and uncertainties. Failure to adequately do so could cause our business, results of operations and financial condition to suffer or fail. We have not yet commercialized any of our potential product candidates and we cannot predict if or when we will become profitable. We have not yet commercialized any product candidate relating to our current assets in the biomedical industry. Our ability to generate revenues from any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to successfully complete clinical trials, obtain necessary regulatory approvals and negotiate arrangements with third parties to help finance the development of, and market and distribute, any product candidate that receives regulatory approval. In addition, we will be subject to the risk that the marketplace will not accept our products. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our product development and commercialization efforts, we are unable to predict the extent of our future losses or when or if we will become profitable, and it is possible we will never commercialize any of our product candidates or become profitable. Our failure to obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize any of our product candidates would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and could result in our inability to continue operations. 11 Table of Contents If we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified personnel, we may not be able to continue our operations. In order to successfully implement and manage our business plan, we will depend upon, among other things, successfully recruiting and retaining qualified personnel having experience in the biomedical industry. Competition for qualified individuals is intense. If we are not able to find, attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms, our business operations could suffer. Additionally, although we have employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these agreements are terminable by them at will and we may not be able to retain their services. The loss of the services of any members of our senior management team could delay or prevent the development and commercialization of any other product candidates and our business could be harmed to the extent that we are not able to find suitable replacements. Future growth could strain our resources, and if we are unable to manage our growth, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. We hope to experience rapid growth in our operations, which will place a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Our future success will depend in part upon the ability of our executive officers to manage growth effectively. This will require that we hire and train additional personnel to manage our expanding operations. In addition, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we may be unable to execute upon our business plan. We may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the assets we recently acquired, or acquire, or develop and commercialize new assets and product candidates. Our future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize in a timely manner the assets we recently acquired from Inovio related to certain non-DNA vaccine technology and intellectual property relating to selective electrochemical tumor ablation, which we now refer to as the OncoSec Medical System (OMS). In addition, we may acquire new assets or product candidates in the future. There are numerous difficulties inherent in acquiring, developing and commercializing new products and product candidates, including difficulties related to: ·successfully identifying potential product candidates; ·developing potential product candidates; ·difficulties in conducting or completing clinical trials, including receiving incomplete, unconvincing or equivocal clinical trials data; ·obtaining requisite regulatory approvals for such products in a timely manner or at all; ·acquiring, developing, testing and manufacturing products in compliance with regulatory standards in a timely manner or at all; ·being subject to legal actions brought by our competitors, which may delay or prevent the development and commercialization of new products; ·delays or unanticipated costs; and ·significant and unpredictable changes in the payer landscape, coverage and reimbursement for any products we develop. As a result of these and other difficulties, we may be unable to develop potential product candidates using our intellectual property, and potential products in development by us may not receive timely regulatory approvals, or approvals at all, necessary for marketing by us or our third-party partners. If we do not acquire or develop product candidates, any of our product candidates are not approved in a timely fashion or at all or, when acquired or developed and approved, cannot be successfully manufactured and commercialized, our operating results would be adversely affected. In addition, we may not recoup our investment in developing products, even if we are successful in commercializing those products. Our business expenditures may not result in the successful acquisition, development or commercialization of products that will prove to be commercially successful or result in the long-term profitability of our business. 12 Table of Contents Regulatory authorities may not approve our product candidates or the approvals may be too limited for us to earn sufficient revenues. The United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) and other foreign regulatory agencies can delay approval of or refuse to approve our product candidates for a variety of reasons, including failure to meet safety and efficacy endpoints in our clinical trials. Our product candidates may not be approved even if they achieve their endpoints in clinical trials. Regulatory agencies, including the FDA, may disagree with our trial design and our interpretations of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials. Clinical trials of our product candidates may not demonstrate that they are safe and effective to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. We recently announced the planned initiation of three Phase II clinical trials to assess our ElectroImmunotherapy technology in patients with metastatic melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. If we cannot adequately demonstrate through the clinical trial process that a therapeutic product we are developing is safe and effective, regulatory approval of that product would be delayed or prevented, which would impair our reputation, increase our costs and prevent us from earning revenues. Even if a product candidate is approved, it may be approved for fewer or more limited indications than requested or the approval may be subject to the performance of significant post-marketing studies. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. Any limitation, condition or denial of approval would have an adverse affect on our business, reputation and results of operations. We acquired our OMS technology from Inovio in March 2011. In 2007, Inovio had been enrolling patients in two Phase III clinical studies designed to evaluate the use of the OMS technology as a treatment for resectable recurrent and second primary squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. The studies were accruing North American and European patients with tumors in the anterior and posterior areas of the oral cavity. The primary endpoint of these two Phase III trials was preservation of function status at four and eight months as measured by the Performance Status Scale (which assesses the ability of a patient to eat normal foods, speak understandably and eat in public). On June 5, 2007, Inovio announced that it had stopped enrollment of these studies based on a recommendation from the trials independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB). The DSMB expressed concern about the efficacy and serious adverse events, including higher mortality rates on the OMS technology arm of the study than on the surgery arm. In the DSMBs opinion, although no single parameter was sufficient to warrant recommending a review of the trial, the totality of data for this recurrent head and neck cancer study suggested an unfavorable benefit-to-risk profile for the OMS arm relative to the surgery arm. The DSMB also noted that slow enrollment presented a possible challenge in meeting the patient enrollment goals of each of these two trials, but that, if timely enrollment could allow reaching the target of 400 patients in the combined trials, this would provide enhanced insights regarding the benefit-to-risk profile of the OMS treatment. Without conducting further analysis, Inovio stopped enrollment and conducted its own interim analysis of the unaudited and unblended data on the 212 patients enrolled to date. These clinical trials were never reinitiated. If we are unable to initiate or complete new Phase III or pivotal clinical studies, we will be unable to commercialize the OMS technology. Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing for product candidates based on the OMS technology could result in increased costs to us and delay or limit our ability to pursue regulatory approval or generate revenues. Clinical trials are very expensive, time consuming and difficult to design and implement. Even if the results of our proposed clinical trials are favorable, clinical trials for product candidates based on the OMS technology will continue for several years and may take significantly longer than expected to complete. Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs and business plan. We do not know whether our planned Phase II clinical trials will be initiated or completed on schedule, if at all. In addition, we do not know whether any other pre-clinical or clinical trials will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to: ·obtaining regulatory authorization to commence a clinical trial; ·reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, clinical investigators and trial sites; ·obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval to initiate and conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site; ·identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators; ·identifying, recruiting and enrolling subjects to participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including competition from other clinical trial programs for similar indications; and ·retaining patients who have initiated a clinical trial but may be prone to withdraw due to side effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy, personal issues, or for any other reason they choose, or who are lost to further follow-up. 13 Table of Contents We believe that we have planned and designed an adequate clinical trial program for our product candidates based on our OMS technology. However, the FDA could determine that it is not satisfied with our plan or the details of our pivotal clinical trial protocols and designs. Additionally, changes in applicable regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in completion of, or if we terminate, any of our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We expect to rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed. We expect to enter into agreements with third-party CROs to conduct our planned clinical trials and anticipate that we may enter into other such agreements in the future regarding any future product candidates. We rely heavily on these parties for the execution of our clinical and pre-clinical studies, and control only certain aspects of their activities. We and our CROs are required to comply with current good clinical practices, or GCPs. The FDA enforces these GCP regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP regulations, the data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Upon inspection, the FDA and similar foreign regulators may determine that our clinical trials are not compliant with GCP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. If any of our relationships with third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates could be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate additional revenues could be delayed. We may incur liability if our promotions of product candidates are determined, or are perceived, to be inconsistent with regulatory guidelines. The FDA provides guidelines with respect to appropriate product promotion and continuing medical and health education activities. Although we endeavor to follow these guidelines, the FDA or the Office of the Inspector General: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services may disagree, and we may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions. In addition, managements attention could be diverted and our reputation could be damaged. We have limited experience in manufacturing our product candidates in quantities required to conduct our clinical trials, and if our products are eventually approved for sale by the FDA, for commercial quantities. We may not be able to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations or produce sufficient product for contract, clinical trial or commercial purposes. The commercial manufacturing of DNA based cytokines and other biological products is a time-consuming and complex process, which must be performed in compliance with the FDAs current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations. We may not be able to comply with the cGMP regulations, and our manufacturing process may be subject to delays, disruptions or quality control problems. In addition, we may need to complete the installation and validation of additional large-scale fermentation and related purification equipment to produce the quantities of product expected to be required for clinical trials, and if our products are eventually approved for sale by the FDA, for commercial purposes. We have limited experience in manufacturing at this scale. Noncompliance with the cGMP regulations, the inability to complete the installation or validation of additional large-scale equipment, or other problems with our manufacturing process may limit or delay the development or commercialization of our product candidates, and cause us to breach our contract manufacturing service arrangements. 14 Table of Contents If any product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval does not achieve broad market acceptance or coverage by third-party payors, the revenues that we generate may be limited. The commercial success of any potential product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities will depend upon the acceptance of these products by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our approved product by third-party payors is also necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any potential product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend on a number of factors, including: ·our ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy; ·acceptance by physicians and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment; ·the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; ·limitations or warnings contained in a products FDA-approved labeling; ·the clinical indications for which the product is approved; ·availability and perceived advantages of alternative treatments; ·any negative publicity related to our or our competitors products; ·the effectiveness of our or any current or future collaborators sales, marketing and distribution strategies; ·pricing and cost effectiveness; ·our ability to obtain sufficient third-party payor coverage or reimbursement; and ·the willingness of patients to pay out of pocket in the absence of third-party payor coverage. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of any of our potential product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require significant resources and may never be successful. If our potential products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, third-party payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products to become or remain profitable. We may not be successful in executing our strategy for the commercialization of our product candidates. If we are unable to successfully execute our commercialization strategy, we may not be able to generate significant revenue. We intend to advance a commercialization strategy that leverages previous in-depth clinical experiences, previous CE (Conformité Européene) approvals for the electroporation-based devices and late stage clinical studies in the United States (Phase III) and Europe (Phase IV). This strategy includes seeking approval from the FDA to initiate pivotal registration studies in the United States for select rare cancers that have limited, adverse or no therapeutic alternatives. This strategy also includes expanding the addressable markets for the OMS therapies through the addition of relevant indications. Our commercialization plan also includes partnering and/or co-developing OMS in developing geographic locations, such as Eastern Europe and Asia, where local resources are best leveraged and appropriate collaborators can be secured. We may not be able to implement our commercialization strategy as we have planned. Further, we have little experience and have not proven our ability to succeed in the biomedical industry and are not certain that our implementation strategy, if implemented correctly, would lead to significant revenue. If we are unable to successfully implement our commercialization plans and drive adoption by patients and physicians of our potential future products through our sales, marketing and commercialization efforts, then we will not be able to generate significant revenue which will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 15 Table of Contents In order to market our proprietary products, we may choose to establish our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. We have no experience in these areas, and if we have problems establishing these capabilities, the commercialization of our products would be impaired. We may choose to establish our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to market products to our target markets. We have no experience in these areas, and developing these capabilities will require significant expenditures on personnel and infrastructure. While we intend to market products that are aimed at a small patient population, we may not be able to create an effective sales force around even a niche market. In addition, some of our product candidates may require a large sales force to call on, educate and support physicians and patients. We may desire in the future to enter into collaborations with one or more pharmaceutical companies to sell, market and distribute such products, but we may not be able to enter into any such arrangement on acceptable terms, if at all. Any collaboration we do enter into may not be effective in generating meaningful product royalties or other revenues for us. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. Because of the difficulties of protecting our proprietary rights and technology, we may not be able to ensure their protection. Our commercial success will depend in large part on obtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection of our product candidates and their respective components, formulations, manufacturing methods and methods of treatment, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our product candidates is dependent upon the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. The coverage claimed in a patent application typically is significantly reduced before a patent is issued, either in the United States or abroad. Consequently, any of our pending or future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents and any patents issued may be subjected to further proceedings limiting their scope and may in any event not contain claims broad enough to provide meaningful protection. Any patents that are issued to us or our future collaborators may not provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantage, and may be circumvented or invalidated. In addition, unpatented proprietary rights, including trade secrets and know-how, can be difficult to protect and may lose their value if they are independently developed by a third party or if their secrecy is lost. Further, because development and commercialization of our potential product candidates can be subject to substantial delays, our patents may expire and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following any future commercialization of products. Moreover, obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. If any of our patents are found to be invalid or unenforceable, or if we are otherwise unable to adequately protect our rights, it could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to commercialize or license our technology and products. We may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to protection of our patent and other intellectual property rights, and we may be unable to successfully protect our rights to our potential products and technology. If we choose to go to court to stop a third party from using the inventions claimed by our patents, that third party may ask the court to rule that the patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced. These lawsuits are expensive and could consume time and other resources even if we were successful in stopping the infringing activity. In addition, the court could decide that our patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop others from using the inventions claimed by the patents. Additionally, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, the court could refuse to stop a third partys infringing activity on the ground that such activities do not infringe our patents. The U.S. Supreme Court has recently revised certain tests regarding granting patents and assessing the validity of patents to make it more difficult to obtain patents. As a consequence, issued patents may be found to contain invalid claims according to the newly revised standards. Some of our patents may be subject to challenge and subsequent invalidation or significant narrowing of claim scope in a reexamination proceeding, or during litigation, under the revised criteria. Third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products. The manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the biomedical industry. These lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. Litigation may be costly and time-consuming, and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel. In addition, if we infringe on the rights of others, we could lose our right to develop, manufacture or market products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. Although the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the biomedical industry have often settled their disputes through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. Furthermore, we 16 Table of Contents cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. As a result, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Extensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities. All biomedical companies are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving government regulation. For the U.S., these regulations are principally administered by the FDA and to a lesser extent by the United Stated Drug Enforcement Agency (the DEA) and state government agencies, as well as by various regulatory agencies in foreign countries where products or product candidates are being manufactured and/or marketed. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Controlled Substances Act and other federal statutes and regulations, and similar foreign statutes and regulations, govern or influence the testing, manufacturing, packing, labeling, storing, record keeping, safety, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our products. Under these regulations, we may become subject to periodic inspection of our facilities, procedures and operations and/or the testing of our product candidates and products by the FDA, the DEA and other authorities, which conduct periodic inspections to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations. In addition, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies conduct pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance with cGMP and other regulations. Following such inspections, the FDA or other agency may issue observations, notices, citations and/or warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection. To the extent that we successfully commercialize any product, we may also be subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory review with respect to manufacturing, processing, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product. Additionally, we may be required to conduct potentially costly post-approval studies and report adverse events associated with our products to FDA and other regulatory authorities. Unexpected or serious health or safety concerns would result in labeling changes, recalls, market withdrawals or other regulatory actions. The range of possible sanctions includes, among others, FDA issuance of adverse publicity, product recalls or seizures, fines, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDAs review of product applications, enforcement actions, injunctions, and civil or criminal prosecution. Any such sanctions, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Under certain circumstances, the FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals. Similar sanctions as detailed above may be available to the FDA under a consent decree, depending upon the actual terms of such decree. If internal compliance programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way, it could materially harm our business. Moreover, the regulations, policies or guidance of the FDA or other regulatory agencies may change and new or additional statutes or government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or further restrict or regulate post-approval activities. If we are not able to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our potential product candidates, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability. We face potential product liability exposure and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability. The clinical use of our product candidates exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse associated with our product candidates could result in injury to a patient or even death. In addition, a liability claim may be brought against us even if our product candidates merely appear to have caused an injury. Product liability claims may be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others coming into contact with our product candidates, among others. Regardless of merit or potential outcome, product liability claims against us may result in, among other effects, the inability to commercialize our product candidates, impairment of our business reputation, withdrawal of clinical trial participants and distraction of managements attention from our primary business. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims we could incur substantial liabilities. The biomedical industry is highly competitive. The biomedical industry has an intensely competitive environment that will require an ongoing, extensive search for technological innovations and the ability to market products effectively, including the ability to communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of products to healthcare professionals in private practice, group practices and payers in managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations and Medicare & Medicaid services. We face competition from a number of sources, including large 17 Table of Contents pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. We are smaller than almost all of our competitors. Most of our competitors have been in business for a longer period of time than us, have a greater number of products on the market and have greater financial and other resources than we do. Furthermore, recent trends in this industry are that large drug companies are consolidating into a smaller number of very large entities, which further concentrates financial, technical and market strength and increases competitive pressure in the industry. If we directly compete with these very large entities for the same markets and/or products, their financial strength could prevent us from capturing a share of those markets. It is possible that developments by our competitors will make any products or technologies that we acquire noncompetitive or obsolete. If our competitors market and/or develop competing product candidates that are marketed more effectively, approved more quickly or demonstrated to be safer or more effective than our product candidates, then our commercial opportunities may be reduced or eliminated. The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary therapeutics. If we are able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates related to our OMS technology or any assets we may acquire in the future, we will face competition from products currently marketed by companies much larger than us that address our targeted indications. In addition to already marketed products, we also face competition from product candidates that are or could be under development. We expect our product candidates, if approved and commercialized, to compete on the basis of, among other things, product efficacy and safety, time to market, price, patient reimbursement by third-party payors, extent of adverse side effects and convenience of treatment procedures. We may not be able to effectively compete in one or more of these areas. We also may not be able to differentiate any products that we are able to market from those of our competitors or successfully develop or introduce new products that are less costly or offer better results than those of our competitors. Additionally, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we are able to or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit or block us from developing or commercializing our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop products that are more effective, more useful, better tolerated, subject to fewer or less severe side effects, more widely prescribed or accepted or less costly than ours and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. If we are unable to compete effectively with the marketed therapeutics of our competitors or if such competitors are successful in developing products that compete with our potential product candidates that are approved, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be materially adversely affected. If we fail to comply with federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. Even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients rights may be applicable to our business. We could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. To the extent that any product we make is sold in a foreign country, we also may be subject to foreign laws and regulations. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Further, any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our managements attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly. We may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management. From time to time we may consider engaging in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases and out-licensing or in-licensing of products, product candidates or technologies. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including, among others, exposure to unknown liabilities, disruption of our business and diversion of our managements time and attention in order to develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies, difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and 18 Table of Contents personnel, and inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses. Accordingly, although we may not choose to undertake or may not be able to successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do complete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future partners, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations, and could result in a material disruption of our commercialization activities, development programs and our business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the commercialization of any potential product candidate could be delayed. We may invest or spend our cash in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a significant return. Our management has considerable discretion in the use of our cash. Our cash may be used for purposes that do not increase our operating results or market value. Until the cash is used, it may be placed in investments that do not produce significant income or that may lose value. The failure of our management to invest or spend our cash effectively could result in unfavorable returns and uncertainty about our prospects, each of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. We have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The continued operation and expansion of our business will require substantial funding. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock. We have paid no cash dividends on any of our capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our available cash to fund the development and growth of our business. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock, which may never occur. If we issue additional shares in the future, our existing shareholders will be diluted. Our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 3,200,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Our Board of Directors may choose to issue some or all of such shares to acquire one or more companies or products and to fund our overhead and general operating requirements. The issuance of any such shares will reduce the book value per share and may contribute to a reduction in the market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we issue any such additional shares, such issuance will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current shareholders. Further, such issuance may result in a change of control of our corporation. Sales of substantial amounts of our shares could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. These sales could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities on commercially reasonable terms. As of October 14, 2011, we have 56,856,000 outstanding shares of common stock. If the warrants issued in the June Private Placement and to Inovio are exercised, based on the number of shares outstanding on October 14, 2011, we would have 69,096,000 outstanding shares of common stock. These warrant holders may exercise their warrants at their own discretion and at any time in accordance with the terms of such warrants until their expiration. The holders of shares of our common stock that are freely transferable have the right to sell their shares at their own discretion and at any time, and such sales are outside of our control. If such stockholders choose to sell substantial amounts of our common stock within a short period of time, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. 19 Table of Contents We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As described in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2011, and 2010, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls and procedures. As a result, we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by these reports. We have implemented, and continue to implement, actions to address these weaknesses and to enhance the reliability and effectiveness of our internal controls and operations; however, the measures we have taken to date and any future measures may not remediate the material weaknesses discussed in our periodic reports. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. We may discover additional material weaknesses, which we may not successfully remediate on a timely basis or at all. Any failure to remediate any material weaknesses identified by us or to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock. Moreover, we will be required to expend significant resources to design, implement and maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. The costs associated with external consultants, as well as internal resources are significant and difficult to predict. As a result of these matters, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. Trading of our stock is restricted by the SECs penny stock regulations and certain FINRA rules, which may limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our common stock. Our securities are covered by certain penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to sale, among other things. These rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers and holders to sell our common stock and may negatively impact the level of trading activity for our common stock. To the extent our common stock remains subject to the penny stock regulations, such regulations may discourage investor interest in and adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (known as FINRA) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. Our common stock is illiquid and the price of our common stock may be negatively impacted by factors which are unrelated to our operations. Our common stock only recently began trading on the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB), and has a limited trading history on that market. Trading on the OTCBB is frequently highly volatile, with low trading volume. Since our common stock began trading on the OTCBB in March 2011, we have experienced significant fluctuations in the stock price and trading volume of our common stock. There is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop in our stock, in which case it could be difficult for stockholders to sell their stock. The market price of our common stock could continue to fluctuate substantially. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include: ·adverse research and development or clinical trial results; ·our inability to obtain additional capital; ·announcement that the FDA denied our request to approve our products for commercialization in the United States, or similar denial by other regulatory bodies which make independent decisions outside the United States; ·potential negative market reaction to the terms or volume of any issuance of shares of our stock to new investors or service providers; 20 Table of Contents ·sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that substantial amounts of our common stock will be sold, by our stockholders in the public market; ·declining working capital to fund operations, or other signs of apparent financial uncertainty; ·significant advances made by competitors that adversely affect our potential market position; and ·the loss of key personnel and the inability to attract and retain additional highly-skilled personnel. Additionally, our clinical trials will be open-ended and, therefore, there is the possibility that information regarding the success (or setbacks) of our clinical trials may be obtained by the public prior to a formal announcement by us.
