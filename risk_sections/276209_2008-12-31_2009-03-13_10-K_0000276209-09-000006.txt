ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or anticipated future results. For a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, see the discussion in “Forward Looking Information” in Item 7 below – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” Because we incur significant capital expenditures annually, we depend on the rates we charge our customers. The water utility business is capital intensive. On an annual basis, we spend significant sums for additions to or replacement of property, plant and equipment. Our ability to maintain and meet our financial objectives is dependent upon the rates we charge our customers. These rates are subject to approval by the DPUC. The Company is entitled to file rate increase requests, from time to time, to recover our investments in utility plant and expenses; however as part of our 2007 Settlement Agreement with the DPUC, we have agreed not to request rate relief that would become effective prior to January 2010. Once a rate increase petition is filed with the DPUC, the ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly. The timing of our future rate increase requests are dependent on the terms of our rate case decision on January 16, 2007 and also partially dependent upon the estimated cost of the administrative process in relation to the investments and expenses that we hope to recover through the rate increase to the extent approved. We can provide no assurances that any future rate increase requests will be approved by the DPUC; and, if approved, we cannot guarantee that any such rate increase requests will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which we initially sought the rate increase. Additionally, the DPUC may rule that a company must reduce its rates. Under a 2007 law, the DPUC may authorize regulated water companies to use a rate adjustment mechanism, known as a Water Infrastructure and Conservation Adjustment (WICA), for eligible projects completed and in service for the benefit of the customers. The Company has filed its IAR and expects a ruling from the DPUC on its IAR in the first quarter of 2009. The Company does not expect to file for a surcharge under the WICA mechanism until the second quarter of 2009. Approximately 90 days after the surcharge filing, customers would begin to see an increase in their bills. For more information related to WICA, please refer to the “Executive Overview” found in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. If we are unable to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due, or we default under certain other provisions of our loan documents, our indebtedness could be accelerated and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance. Our performance is affected by many factors, some of which are beyond our control. We believe that our cash generated from operations, and, if necessary, borrowing under our existing and planned credit facilities, will be sufficient to enable us to make our debt payments as they become due. If, however, we do not generate sufficient cash, we may be required to refinance our obligations or sell additional equity, which may be on terms that are not favorable to the Company as current terms. No assurance can be given that any refinancing or sale of equity will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms. In addition, our failure to comply with certain provisions contained in our trust indentures and loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness could lead to a default on these documents, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness. Credit market volatility may affect our ability to refinance our existing debt, borrow funds under our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt. The credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for more than 12 months. In recent months, the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels. In many cases, the markets have limited credit capacity for certain issuers, and lenders have requested shorter terms. The market for new debt financing is limited and in some cases not available at all. In addition, the markets have increased the uncertainty that lenders will be able to comply with their previous commitments. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, we may not be able to refinance our existing debt when it comes due, draw upon our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt, which may require us to seek other funding sources to meet our liquidity needs or to fund our capital expenditures budget. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or other financing on reasonable terms, or at all. Failure to maintain our existing credit ratings could affect our cost of funds and related margins and liquidity position. Since 2003, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services has rated our outstanding debt and has given credit ratings to us and our subsidiary The Connecticut Water Company. Their evaluations are based on a number of factors, which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. On August 26, 2008, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services raised the senior unsecured rating on Connecticut Water Service to 'A' from 'A-' and affirmed the 'A' rating of The Connecticut Water Company, our subsidiary, both with an outlook of "stable". In light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the difficult financial markets, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current strong credit ratings. Failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins and liquidity position. 9 Table of Contents Market disruptions caused by the worldwide financial crisis could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long-term commitments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on our revolving credit facility and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs. Further disruptions in the credit markets or further deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition, may discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments, extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. Market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt securities in the capital markets. The Company has received approval from its Board of Directors to increase its line of credit to $40 million from its current $21 million. The Company expects to secure access to increased lines of credit by the end of the second quarter of 2009. Our inability to comply with debt covenants under our credit facilities could result in prepayment obligations. We are obligated to comply with debt covenants under some of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to comply with covenants under our credit facilities could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay or finance these borrowings before their due date, could limit future borrowings, and result in cross default issues and increase borrowing costs. The covenants are normal and customary in bank and loan agreements. The Company was in compliance with the covenants at December 31, 2008. Market conditions may unfavorably impact the value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities which then could require significant additional funding. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans and could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position. As detailed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has significant obligations in these areas and the Company holds significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations, which may affect investment returns, which may fall below the Company’s projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets, as was experienced in 2008, will increase the funding requirements under the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value. Additionally, the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Also, future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable from our customers, and our the results of operations and financial position of the Company could be negatively affected. Our operating costs could be significantly increased because of state and federal environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act and similar state laws, and federal and state regulations issued under these laws by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state environmental regulatory agencies. These laws and regulations establish, among other things, criteria and standards for drinking water and for discharges into the waters of the United States and/or Connecticut. Pursuant to these laws, we are required to obtain various environmental permits from environmental regulatory agencies for our operations. We cannot assure that we have been or will be at all times in full compliance with these laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Environmental laws and regulations are complex and change frequently. These laws, and the enforcement thereof, have tended to become more stringent over time. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and our permits, it is possible that new or stricter standards could be imposed that will raise our operating costs. Although these costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates, there can be no assurance that the DPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such costs. In summary, we cannot be assured that our costs of complying with, or discharging liabilities under, current and future environmental and health and safety laws will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 10 Table of Contents Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations which could affect demand for our water services and our revenues. Demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues. In 2008, the Company’s Northern region experienced approximately double the rainfall when compared to 2007, reducing per customer residential consumption. Declining per customer residential water usage may reduce our revenues, financial condition and results of operations in future years. A trend of declining per customer residential water usage in Connecticut has been observed for the last several years, which we would attribute to the declining household size reported throughout the state, as well as increased water conservation, including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential users. Our regulated business is heavily dependent on revenue generated from rates we charge to our residential customers for the volume of water they use. The rate we charge for our water is regulated by the DPUC and we may not unilaterally adjust our rates to reflect changes in demand. Declining volume of residential water usage may, thus, have a negative impact on our operating revenues in the future if regulators do not reflect any usage declines in the rate setting design process. Potential regulatory changes or drought conditions may impact our ability to serve our current and future customers’ demand for water and our financial results. We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future demands of our customers. Changes in regulatory requirements could affect our ability to utilize existing supplies and/or secure new sources, as required. Insufficient supplies or an interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although not occurring in 2008, drought conditions could interfere with our sources of water supply and could adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our existing and future customers. An interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions, which may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. The failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or dismantle, any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We own and operate 32 dams throughout the state of Connecticut. While the Company maintains robust dam maintenance and inspection programs, a failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and damage to residential and/or commercial property downstream for which we may be responsible, in whole or in part. The failure of a dam could also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any losses or liabilities incurred due to the failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates. Any failure of our reservoirs, storage tanks, mains or distribution networks could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation. Connecticut Water distributes water through an extensive network of mains and stores water in reservoirs and storage tanks located across Connecticut. A failure of major mains, reservoirs, or tanks could result in injuries and damage to residential and/or commercial property for which we may be responsible, in whole or in part. The failure of major mains, reservoirs or tanks may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our water distribution network in order to conduct repairs. Such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water delivery requirements prescribed by governmental regulators, including the DPUC, and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and reputation. Any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates. Any future acquisitions we may undertake may involve risks and uncertainties. An important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and integration of water systems in order to move into new service areas and to broaden our current service areas. Connecticut Water has completed two acquisitions since the beginning of 2008 through the filing of this report on Form 10-K on March 13, 2009. The acquisitions of Birmingham’s Eastern Division and Ellington Acres water systems have increased the Company’s customer base by approximately 3,000 customers. Following these acquisitions, The Connecticut Water Company now serves more than 88,000 customers, or a population of over 300,000 people, in more than 54 Connecticut towns. We will not be able to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates. It is our intent, when practical, to integrate any businesses we acquire with our existing operations. The negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management's time and resources. Future acquisitions by us could result in: · dilutive issuances of our equity securities; · incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities; · failure to have effective internal control over financial reporting; · fluctuations in quarterly results; and · other acquisition-related expenses. 11 Table of Contents Some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as our ability to finance our business and comply with regulatory requirements. The businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve sales and profitability that would justify our investment and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process, including in the integration of controls necessary for internal control and financial reporting, could interfere with our operations, reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal controls. In addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions. Water supply contamination may adversely affect our business. Our water supplies are subject to contamination, including contamination from the development of naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from man-made sources, such as MTBE, and possible terrorist attacks. In the event that our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source or provide additional treatment. We may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates. We could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims. The need to increase security may continue to increase our operating costs. In addition to the potential pollution of our water supply as described above, in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the ongoing threats to the nation's health and security, we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply. We have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations and supplies. These costs may be significant. We are currently not aware of any specific threats to our facilities, operations or supplies; however, it is possible that we would not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur. The accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition. We make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding, among others: · the number of years to depreciate certain assets; · amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolesces and uninsured losses; · our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims, including medical and workers’ compensation claims; · future costs for pensions and other post-retirement benefits, and; · possible tax allowances. 12 Table of Contents The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs at the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not accurate, we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period. Key employee turnover may adversely affect our operating results. Our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management team or the inability to hire and retain experienced management personnel could harm our operating results. ITEM 1B.
