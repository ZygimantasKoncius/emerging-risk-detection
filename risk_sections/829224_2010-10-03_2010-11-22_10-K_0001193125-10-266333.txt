Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risks and factors listed below, however, are not exhaustive. Other sections of this 10-K include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operation.  Our financial condition and results of operations are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control. Our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control. Any one or more of the factors set forth below could adversely impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations:  lower customer traffic or average value per transaction, which negatively impacts comparable store sales, net revenues, operating income, operating margins and earnings per share, due to:  the impact of initiatives by competitors and increased competition generally; 10 Table of Contents  customers trading down to lower priced products within Starbucks, and/or shifting to competitors with lower priced products;  lack of customer acceptance of new products or price increases necessary to cover costs of new products and/or higher input costs;  unfavorable general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate that adversely affect consumer spending;  declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products; or  adverse impacts resulting from negative publicity regarding our business practices or the health effects of consuming our products;  cost increases that are either wholly or partially beyond our control, such as:  commodity costs for commodities that can only be partially hedged, such as fluid milk, and high quality arabica coffee;  labor costs such as increased health care costs, general market wage levels and workers compensation insurance costs;  litigation, particularly class action litigation; or  construction costs associated with new store openings;  any material interruption in our supply chain beyond our control, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants or the failures of third-party suppliers, or interruptions in service by common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, or trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions;  delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share;  the degree to which we enter into, maintain, develop, and are able to negotiate appropriate terms and conditions, and enforce, commercial and other agreements; and  the impact on our business due to labor discord, war, terrorism (including incidents targeting us), political instability and natural disasters.  Economic conditions in the US and certain International markets could adversely affect our business and financial results. As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macro-economic conditions. Our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, increased fuel and energy costs, higher interest rates, higher taxes, reduced access to credit and lower home prices. Any resulting decreases in customer traffic or average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues result in sales de-leveraging which creates downward pressure on margins. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis. 11 Table of Contents  We may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. There is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. These strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include:  successfully leveraging Starbucks brand outside the company-operated store base, including an increased focus on international licensed stores, Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew, and the Seattles Best Coffee brand;  focusing on relevant product innovation and profitable new growth platforms;  accelerating the growth of our global consumer products business as we transition from our licensing relationships with Kraft Foods Global, Inc.;  balancing disciplined global store growth while meeting target store-level unit economics in a given market; and  executing a multi-channel advertising and marketing campaign to effectively communicate our message directly to Starbucks consumers and partners.  We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability. The specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, service, convenience, and price, and we face significant competition in each of our channels and markets. In the US, the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. Similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors in our international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. Increased competition in the US packaged coffee and tea and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets could adversely affect the profitability of the CPG segment. (See also the discussion under Competition in Item 1).  We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our US operating segment. Our financial performance is highly dependent on our US operating segment, which comprised approximately three-quarters of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2010. Although the US segments operating results have improved significantly, primarily due to our restructuring efforts (substantially completed in 2009) and to improved revenue trends, if the operational improvements are not sustained going forward and/or the revenue trends slow or decline, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.  We are increasingly dependent on the success of our International operating segment in order to achieve our growth targets. Our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of the International operating segment. Some or all of our International market business units (MBUs), which we generally define by the countries or regions in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. The performance of our International operating segment may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of our large MBUs. In particular, our Canada, Japan and UK MBUs account for a significant portion of the net revenue and earnings of our International operating segment and a decline in the performance of any of these MBUs could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of our International operating segment. Additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of International MBUs are different than those affecting our US stores and licensees. Tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in new international markets into which we and our licensees expand may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in our existing markets. Occupancy costs and store operating expenses are also sometimes higher internationally than in the US due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. Because many of our International operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to US operations. 12 Table of Contents Our International operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as:  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;  changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets;  interpretation and application of laws and regulations;  restrictive actions of foreign or US governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government intervention favoring local competitors, and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership;  import or other business licensing requirements;  the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;  limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;  in developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving targeted levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast;  difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service, due to distance, language and cultural differences;  local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees; and  delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share. Moreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries, which are important to our long-term growth prospects.  Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. We purchase, roast, and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and, in fiscal 2010, the base C coffee commodity price increased markedly. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium above the C price. This premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the C coffee commodity price do increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. The supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, political and economic conditions, as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices (see discussion of Product Supply in Item 1 above) and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have an adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Although less material to our operations than coffee or dairy, other commodities including but not limited to those related to food inputs and energy, are important to our operations. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities could have an adverse impact on our profitability. 13 Table of Contents  Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. Failure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to operating margins, earnings per share, comparable store sales, and net revenues, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. In addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance.  A regional or global health pandemic could severely affect our business. A health pandemic is a disease outbreak that spreads rapidly and widely by infection and affects many individuals in an area or population at the same time. If a regional or global health pandemic were to occur, depending upon its duration and severity, our business could be severely affected. Customers might avoid public gathering places, such as our stores, in the event of a health pandemic, and governments might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease. A regional or global health pandemic might also adversely impact our business by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain and by causing staffing shortages in our stores. The impact of a health pandemic on us might be disproportionately greater than on other companies that depend less on the gathering of people together for the sale, use or license of their products and services.  Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands. We believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our corporate social responsibility programs. The Starbucks brand has been highly rated in several global brand value studies. To be successful in the future, particularly outside of US, where the Starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities. Even isolated business incidents that erode consumer trust, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value. Consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we fail to preserve the quality of our products, are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets.  Our business depends in large part on the success of our business partners and suppliers, and our brand and reputation may be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside of our control. Our business strategy, including our plans for new stores, foodservice, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, and licensee and partnership relationships, particularly in our International markets. Licensees are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded beverages, food and other products directly to customers. We provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, these business partners, but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial pressures. We believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensees as they do from us and we strive to ensure customers have the same experience whether they visit a company-operated or licensed store. Any shortcoming of a Starbucks business partner, particularly an issue affecting the quality of the service experience or the safety of beverages or food, may be attributed by customers to us, thus damaging our reputation and brand value and potentially affecting our results of operations. Our products and, in particular, our coffee and tea products, are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations. We rely on these suppliers and vendors to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws. Our ability to find qualified suppliers and vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the US. A vendor or suppliers failure to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, and comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. These issues could negatively impact our business and profitability. 14 Table of Contents  The loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial results. Much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives, some of which involve ongoing expansion in business channels outside of our traditional company-operated store model. Our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees who we rely on to give customers a superior in-store experience. Accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores. If we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.  Adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, as well as reports of incidents involving food-borne illnesses or food tampering, whether or not accurate, could harm our business. Some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other active compounds, the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny, including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other active compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects. Particularly in the US, there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products. While we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are low in caffeine and calories, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products. Similarly, instances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply, food-borne illnesses and food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors and could in the future affect us as well. Any report linking us to the use of unclean water, food-borne illnesses or food tampering could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our beverages and food products, and possibly lead to product liability claims. Clean water is critical to the preparation of specialty coffee beverages and our ability to ensure a clean water supply to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. If customers become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could also be forced to temporarily close some stores. In addition, instances of food-borne illnesses or food tampering, even those occurring solely at the restaurants or stores of competitors, could, by resulting in negative publicity about the foodservice industry, adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, could materially harm our business and results of operations.  Effectively managing growth is challenging and places significant strain on our management and employees and our operational, financial, and other resources. Effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we continue to expand into new channels outside the retail store model, increase our focus on our global consumer products business, and expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, philosophy and standards. Growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of high quality raw materials, to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees to meet our financial targets, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience. 15 Table of Contents  If we pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures, we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses. From time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures, or joint ventures with third parties. These transactions create risks such as:  disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;  problems retaining key personnel;  operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquire or in which we invest;  the potential impairment of tangible assets, intangible assets and goodwill acquired in the acquisitions;  the difficulty of incorporating an acquired business into our business and unanticipated expenses related to such integration; and  potential unknown liabilities associated with a business we acquire or in which we invest In the event of any future acquisitions, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, incur debt, or take on contingent liabilities, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business.  We rely heavily on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations, including for management of our supply chain, point-of-sale processing in our stores, Starbucks Cards, online business and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of our operations, and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem.  Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could harm our business and financial results. Our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, regulations and tax requirements, including those imposed by the SEC, NASDAQ, and foreign countries, as well as applicable labor laws. The complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels, together with the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. Failure to comply with the various laws and regulations as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in damage to our reputation, civil and criminal liability, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements.  Deterioration in operating performance could lead to increased leverage, which may harm our financial condition and results of operations. Any reduction in cash flow relative to the level of our financial obligations would result in an increase in leverage. Any increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing. In addition, an increase in leverage could raise the likelihood of a financial covenant breach which in turn could limit our access to existing funding under our credit facility. Our ability to satisfy our operating lease obligations and make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends on our future performance. Should we experience deterioration in operating performance, we will have less cash flow available to meet these obligations. In addition, if such deterioration were to lead to the 16 Table of Contents closure of underperforming stores, we would need to fund the costs of terminating store leases. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to satisfy these financial obligations, we may be required to, among other things:  seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;  refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;  sell selected assets;  discontinue our common stock dividend; or  reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our financial obligations. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
