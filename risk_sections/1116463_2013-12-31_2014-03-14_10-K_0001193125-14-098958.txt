ITEM 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report and our other SEC filings, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not disclosed or not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. Regulatory Risks The Need to Obtain Regulatory Approvals Could Increase Our Costs and Adversely Affect Our Financial Performance. Many of our proposed and existing products are subject to regulation by the FDA and other governmental or public health agencies. In particular, we are subject to strict governmental controls on the development, manufacture, labeling, distribution and marketing of our products. In addition, we or our distributors are often required to obtain approval or registration with foreign governments or regulatory bodies before we can import and sell our products in foreign countries. The process of obtaining required approvals or registrations from governmental or public health agencies can involve lengthy and detailed laboratory testing, human clinical trials, sampling activities and other costly, time-consuming procedures. These approvals and registrations can require the submission of a large amount of clinical data which can be expensive and may require significant time to obtain. It is also possible that a product will not perform at a level needed to generate the clinical data required to obtain approval or registration. The submission of an application to the FDA or other regulatory authority does not guarantee that an approval or registration to market or import the product will be received. A regulatory authority may impose requirements as a condition to granting an approval or registration, may include significant restrictions or limitations as part of any approval or clearance it grants and may delay or refuse to grant approval or registration, even though a product has been approved or registered without restrictions or limitations in another country or by another agency. All in vitro diagnostic products that are to be sold in the EU must bear the CE mark indicating conformance with the essential requirements of the IVDD. We have obtained the CE mark for several of our existing products. We also intend to apply for CE marks for certain of our future products and are not aware of any material reason why we would be unable to obtain those marks. However, there can be no assurance that compliance with all provisions of the IVDD will be demonstrated and the CE mark will be obtained or maintained for all products that we desire to sell in the EU. The failure to obtain or maintain the CE mark for one or more of our products could lead to the termination of strategic alliances and agreements for sales of those products in the EU. Our Ability to Respond to Changes in Regulatory Requirements Could Adversely Affect Our Business. Newly promulgated regulations could require changes to our products, necessitate additional clinical trials or procedures, or make it impractical or impossible for us to market our products for certain uses, in certain 23 Table of Contents markets, or at all. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have the ability to change the requirements for obtaining product approval and/or impose new or additional requirements as part of the approval process. These changes or new or additional requirements may occur after the completion of substantial clinical work and other costly development activities. The implementation of such changes or new or additional requirements may result in additional clinical trials and substantial additional costs and could delay or make it more difficult or complicated to obtain product approvals. Failure to Comply With FDA or Other Regulatory Requirements May Require Us to Suspend Production of Our Products or Institute a Recall Which Could Result in Higher Costs and a Loss of Revenues. Regulation by the FDA and other federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies impacts many aspects of our operations, and the operations of our suppliers and distributors, including manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record keeping. For example, our manufacturing facilities and those of our suppliers and distributors are, or can be, subject to periodic regulatory inspections. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the performance of approved products or place conditions on any product approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of those products. Regulatory agencies may impose restrictions on our or our distributors advertising and promotional activities or preclude these activities altogether if a noncompliance is believed to exist. In addition, the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, including withdrawal of the product from the market. We are also subject to routine inspection by the FDA and other agencies for compliance with Quality System Requirement and Medical Device Reporting requirements in the United States and other applicable regulations worldwide, including but not limited to ISO regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements can result in, among other things, 483 notices, warning letters, administrative or judicially imposed sanctions such as injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to grant premarket clearance or PMA approval for devices, withdrawal of marketing clearances or approvals, or criminal prosecution. The ability of our suppliers to supply critical components or materials and of our distributors to sell our products could also be adversely affected if their operations are determined to be out of compliance. Such actions by the FDA and other regulatory bodies could adversely affect our revenues, costs and results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, we must frequently make subjective judgments with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If regulators subsequently disagree with the manner in which we have sought to comply with these regulations, we could be subjected to substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as product recall, seizure or injunction with respect to the sale of our products. The assessment of any civil and criminal penalties against us could severely impair our reputation within the industry and any limitation on our ability to manufacture and market our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our Inability to Manufacture Products in Accordance With Applicable Specifications, Performance Standards or Quality Requirements Could Adversely Affect Our Business. The materials and processes used to manufacture our products must meet detailed specifications, performance standards and quality requirements to ensure our products will perform in accordance with their label claims, our customers expectations and applicable regulatory requirements. As a result, our products and the materials used in their manufacture or assembly undergo regular inspections and quality testing. Factors such as defective materials or processes, mechanical failures, human errors, environmental conditions, changes in materials or production methods by our vendors, and other events or conditions could cause our products or the materials used to produce or assemble our products to fail inspections and quality testing or otherwise not perform in accordance with our label claims or the expectations of our customers. 24 Table of Contents Any failure or delay in our ability to meet the applicable specifications, performance standards, quality requirements or customer expectations could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products or comply with regulatory requirements. These events could, in turn, adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. We Are Subject to Numerous Government Regulations in Addition to FDA Requirements, Which Could Increase Our Costs and Affect Our Operations. In addition to the FDA and other regulations described previously, laws and regulations in some states may restrict our ability to sell products in those states. While we intend to work with state legislators and regulators to remove or modify any applicable restrictions, there is no guarantee we will be successful in these efforts. We must also comply with numerous laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, disposal of hazardous substances and labor or employment practices. Compliance with these laws or any new or changed laws regulating our business could result in substantial costs. Because of the number and extent of the laws and regulations affecting our industry, and the number of governmental agencies whose actions could affect our operations, it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and impact of these requirements. To the extent the costs and procedures associated with complying with these laws and requirements are substantial or it is determined that we do not comply, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Compliance With Regulations Governing Public Company Corporate Governance and Reporting is Complex and Expensive. Many laws and regulations impose obligations on public companies, which have increased the scope, complexity and cost of corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices. Examples include the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market, The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SECs requirements for public companies to provide financial statements in interactive data format using the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), and the International Financial Reporting Standards conversion requirements. Our implementation of certain aspects of these laws and regulations has required and will continue to require substantial management time and oversight and may require us to incur significant additional accounting and legal costs. We continually evaluate and monitor developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the ultimate amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These laws and regulations are also subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Although we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, if we fail to comply with any of these requirements, legal proceedings may be initiated against us, which may adversely affect our business. Evolving Legislative, Judicial and Ethical Standards on the Use of Technology and Biotechnology Could Affect Our Molecular Collection Systems Business. The adoption of genetic testing is occurring within the broader context of a myriad of decisions related to genetic patenting and genotyping. Issues associated with regulatory requirements, health insurance, data access, intellectual property protection, national and international legislative initiatives and other variables impact the widespread adoption of genetic testing or specific segments or tests within the genetic testing market. These developments could impact sales of our molecular collection systems products. 25 Table of Contents Federal and State Laws Pertaining to Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, and laws constraining the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements we may enter into with physicians, hospitals, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many of the existing requirements are new and have not been definitively interpreted by state authorities or courts, and available guidance is limited. Unless and until we are in full compliance with these laws, we could face enforcement action and fines and other penalties, and could receive adverse publicity, all of which could materially harm our business. In addition, changes in or evolving interpretations of these laws, regulations, or administrative or judicial interpretations, may require us to change our business practices or subject our business practices to legal challenges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to Our Industry, Business and Strategy Our Ability to Sell Products Could be Adversely Affected by Competition From New and Existing Diagnostic Products. The diagnostics industry is focused on the testing of biological specimens in a laboratory or at the point of care and is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Many of our principal competitors have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources. As new products enter the market, our products may become obsolete or a competitors products may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than ours. If we fail to maintain and enhance our competitive position, our customers may decide to use products developed by competitors which could result in a loss of revenues. We also face competition from products that are sold at a lower price. Where this occurs, customers may choose to buy lower cost products from third parties or we may be forced to sell our products at a lower price, both of which could result in a loss of revenues or a lower gross margin contribution from the sale of our products. We may also be required to increase our marketing efforts in order to compete effectively, which would increase our costs. Our Research, Development and Commercialization Efforts May Not Succeed and Our Competitors May Develop and Commercialize More Effective or Successful Diagnostic Products. In order to remain competitive, we must regularly commit substantial resources to research and development and the commercialization of new or enhanced products. The research and development process generally takes a significant amount of time from product inception to commercial launch. This process is conducted in various stages. During each stage there is a substantial risk that we will not achieve our goals on a timely basis, or at all, and we may have to abandon a new or enhanced product in which we have invested substantial time and money. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we incurred $10.9 million, $12.4 million and $18.4 million, respectively, in research and development expenses. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to our research and development activities. Successful products require significant development and investment, including testing to demonstrate their performance capabilities, cost-effectiveness or other benefits prior to commercialization. In addition, regulatory approval must be obtained before most products may be sold. Additional development efforts on these products 26 Table of Contents may be required before any regulatory authority will review them. As noted above, regulatory authorities may not approve these products for commercial sale or may substantially delay or condition approval. In addition, even if a product is developed and all applicable regulatory approvals are obtained, there may be little or no market for the product. Accordingly, if we fail to develop and gain commercial acceptance for our products, or if competitors develop more effective products or a greater number of successful new products, customers may decide to use products developed by our competitors. This would result in a loss of revenues and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and business. Failure to Achieve Our Financial and Strategic Objectives Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on Our Business Prospects. As a result of any number of risk factors identified in this Annual Report, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in implementing our financial and strategic objectives, including our efforts to increase sales of our newest products, the OraQuick® In-Home HIV test and the OraQuick® HCV test, or continue growing our molecular collection systems business. In addition, the funds for research, clinical development and other projects have in the past come primarily from our business operations. If our business slows and we have less money available to fund research and development and clinical programs, we will have to decide at that time which programs to cut, and by how much. Similarly, if adequate financial, personnel, equipment or other resources are not available, we may be required to delay or scale back our business. Our operations will be adversely affected if our total revenue and gross profits do not correspondingly increase or if our technology, product, clinical and market development efforts are unsuccessful or delayed. Furthermore, our failure to successfully introduce new or enhanced products and develop new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. If We Lose Our Key Personnel or Are Unable to Attract and Retain Qualified Personnel as Necessary, Our Business Could be Harmed. Our success depends to a large extent upon the contributions of our executive officers, management and sales, marketing, operations and scientific staff. We may not be able to attract or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among medical products and other life science businesses. We generally do not enter into employment agreements requiring our employees to work for us for any specified period. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to effectively manufacture, sell and market our products, to meet the demands of our strategic partners in a timely fashion, or to support research, development and clinical programs. Although we believe we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, competition for experienced scientists and other personnel from numerous companies and academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to do so on acceptable terms. Acquisitions or Investments May Not Generate the Expected Benefits and Could Disrupt Our Ongoing Business, Distract Our Management, Increase Our Expenses and Adversely Affect Our Business. We may enter into strategic acquisitions or investments as a way to expand our business. These activities, and their impact on our business, are subject to many risks, including the following:  Suitable acquisitions or investments may not be found or consummated on terms or schedules that are satisfactory to us or consistent with our objectives;  The benefits expected to be derived from an acquisition may not materialize and could be affected by numerous factors, such as regulatory developments, insurance reimbursement, general economic conditions and increased competition; 27 Table of Contents  We may be unable to successfully integrate an acquired companys personnel, assets, management systems, products and/or technology into our business;  Worse than expected performance of an acquired business may result in the impairment of intangible assets;  Acquisitions may require substantial expense and management time and could disrupt our business;  We may not be able to accurately forecast the performance or ultimate impact of an acquired business;  An acquisition and subsequent integration activities may require greater capital and other resources than originally anticipated at the time of acquisition;  An acquisition may result in the incurrence of unexpected expenses, the dilution of our earnings or our existing stockholders percentage ownership, or potential losses from undiscovered liabilities not covered by an indemnification from the seller(s) of the acquired business;  An acquisition may result in the loss of our or the acquired companys key personnel, customers, distributors or suppliers; and  An acquisition of a foreign business may involve additional risks, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exposure, liability or restrictions under foreign laws or regulations, and our inability to successfully assimilate differences in foreign business practices or overcome language or cultural barriers. The occurrence of one or more of the above or other factors may prevent us from achieving all or a significant part of the benefits expected from an acquisition or investment. This may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to grow our business or otherwise achieve our financial and strategic objectives. Our Revenues Could be Affected by Third-Party Reimbursement Policies and Potential Cost Constraints. The end-users of our products include hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers. Use of our products could be adversely impacted if end-users do not receive adequate reimbursement for the cost of our products from their patients healthcare insurers or payors. Our net sales could also be adversely affected by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private healthcare payors, including in particular the level of reimbursement for our products. In the United States, healthcare providers such as hospitals and physicians who purchase diagnostic products generally rely on third-party payors, such as private health insurance plans, Medicare and Medicaid, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the product and procedure. The overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry, both foreign and domestic, to reduce the cost of products and services. Given the efforts to control and reduce healthcare costs in the United States in recent years, currently available levels of reimbursement may not continue to be available in the future for our existing products or products under development. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, current reimbursement amounts may be decreased in the future and future legislation, and regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors, may reduce the demand for our products or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. In addition, consolidation among healthcare providers or other participants in the healthcare industry is occurring and has resulted, and may continue to result, in fewer, more powerful healthcare groups with increased purchasing power and the ability to drive down the prices paid for our products. 28 Table of Contents Changes in Healthcare Regulation Could Affect Our Revenues, Costs and Financial Condition. In recent years, there have been numerous initiatives at the federal and state level for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for, the availability of and reimbursement for healthcare services in the United States. These initiatives have ranged from proposals to fundamentally change federal and state healthcare reimbursement programs, including providing comprehensive healthcare coverage to the public under government-funded programs, to minor modifications to existing programs. One example is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Federal healthcare reform law enacted in 2010 (Affordable Care Act). Similar reforms may occur internationally. Legislative and regulatory bodies are likely to continue to pursue healthcare reform initiatives and may continue to reduce funding in an effort to lower overall federal healthcare spending. The ultimate content and timing of any healthcare reform legislation and its resulting impact on us are impossible to predict. If significant reforms are made to the healthcare system in the United States, or in other jurisdictions, those reforms may increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The new Affordable Care Act imposes a 2.3% excise tax on certain transactions, including U.S. sales of many medical devices, which includes domestic sales of certain of our products. This new tax became effective in January 2013. It is unclear whether and to what extent other unanticipated developments resulting from the Affordable Care Act, such as an increase in the number of people with health insurance, will provide us with additional revenue to help offset this tax. If such additional revenue does not materialize or our efforts to offset the excise tax through spending cuts, price increases or other actions are unsuccessful, the increased tax burden will adversely affect our financial performance. New or Changed Testing Guidelines Could Affect Sales of Our Diagnostic Products. From time to time, governmental agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issue diagnostic testing guidelines or recommendations, which can affect the usage of our HIV and HCV testing products. In addition, some states have promulgated, or may in the future promulgate, laws and regulations that affect HIV or HCV testing. The issuance of new laws or guidelines, or changes in existing laws or guidelines, and the manner in which these new or changed laws and guidelines are interpreted and applied by healthcare practitioners, could impact the degree to which our OraQuick® rapid HIV and HCV testing products are used. New or changed laws or guidelines could affect the number of people tested, the frequency of testing and whether testing products such as our OraQuick® HIV and HCV tests are used broadly for screening large populations or in a more limited capacity as a confirmatory test or otherwise. These factors could in turn affect the level of sales of our products and our results of operations. Reductions in Government Funding and Research Budgets Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Financial Results. We sell our OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV-1/2 test and our OraQuick® HCV test into the public health market which consists of state, county and other governmental public health agencies, community based organizations, service organizations and similar entities. We also sell these products into the hospital market, including to hospitals owned or operated by agencies of the U.S. government. Many of these customers depend to a significant degree on grants or funding provided by governmental agencies to run their operations including programs that use our products. In international markets, we often sell our products to or through foreign governmental agencies or parties funded by such agencies. Our subsidiary, DNAG, sells many of its products to researchers at academic institutions, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, government laboratories and private foundations. Many of DNAGs research customers are dependent for their funding on grants from U.S. governmental agencies such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health and agencies in other countries. 29 Table of Contents The level of available government grants or funding in the U.S. and elsewhere is unpredictable and may be affected by various factors including the current economic downturn, future economic conditions, legislative and regulatory developments, political changes, civil unrest and changing priorities for research and development activities. Any reduction or delay in government funding could cause our customers to delay, reduce or forego purchases of our products. In August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which was designed to reduce federal spending over the next 10 years by $2.5 trillion. Under that law, a select committee of Congress was tasked with identifying and recommending $1.2 trillion in spending cuts by late November 2011. Because the committee did not agree on spending cuts within that time frame, certain automatic cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending became effective on March 1, 2013. We cannot predict whether Congress will attempt to suspend or restructure the automatic budget cuts or what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress. Although their full impact is uncertain, the spending cuts implemented under this law have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect our customers ability to purchase our products. In addition, other legislative or regulatory changes may be adopted which could adversely affect our ability to sell our current products or successfully develop and commercialize new products. Increases in Demand for Our Products Could Require Us to Expend Considerable Resources or Harm Our Customer Relationships if We are Unable to Meet That Demand. If we experience significant or unexpected increases in the demand for our products, we and our suppliers may not be able to meet that demand without expending additional capital resources. These capital resources could involve the cost of new machinery or new manufacturing facilities. This would increase our capital costs, which could adversely affect our earnings. Our suppliers may be unable or unwilling to expend the necessary capital resources or otherwise expand their capacity. In addition, new manufacturing equipment or facilities may require FDA approval before they can be used to manufacture our products. To the extent we are unable to obtain or are delayed in obtaining such approvals, our ability to meet the demand for our products could be adversely affected. If we or our suppliers are unable to develop necessary manufacturing capabilities in a timely manner, our sales could be adversely affected. If we fail to increase production volumes in a cost effective manner or if we experience lower than anticipated yields or production problems as a result of changes that we or our suppliers make in our manufacturing processes to meet increased demand, we could experience shipment delays or interruptions and increased manufacturing costs, which could also have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. Unexpected increases in demand for our products may require us to obtain additional raw materials in order to manufacture products to meet the demand. Some raw materials require significant ordering lead time and some are currently obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have long-term supply agreements with certain of these suppliers, but these long-term agreements involve risks for us, such as our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of raw materials and components and our reduced control over pricing, quality and timely delivery. It is also possible that one or more of these suppliers may become unwilling or unable to deliver materials to us. Any shortfall in our supply of raw materials and components, or our inability to quickly and cost-effectively obtain alternative sources for this supply, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet increased demand for our products. This could negatively affect our total revenues or cost of sales and related profits. Our inability to meet customer demand for our products could also harm our customer relationships and impair our reputation within the industry. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. 30 Table of Contents We Rely on Information Technology in Our Operations and Any Material Failure, Inadequacy, Interruption or Security Breach of that Technology Could Harm Our Ability to Efficiently Operate Our Business. We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations and on the internet, including for management of inventory, purchase orders, invoices, shipping, interactions with our third-party logistics provider, revenue and expense accounting, online business and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems and the internet. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a breach in security of these systems through a cyber attack or otherwise, or disruptions in the operation of the internet, could cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of our operations. Significant capital investments could be required to remediate any such problem. Security breaches of employee information or other confidential or proprietary data could also adversely impact our reputation, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. Risks Relating to Collaborators The Use of Sole Supply Sources or Third-Party Suppliers For Critical Components of Our Products Could Adversely Affect Our Business. We currently purchase certain critical components of our products from sole supply sources or other third-party suppliers. For example, the biological antigens, nitrocellulose and certain other components required to make our OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV-1/2 test, OraQuick® In-Home HIV test and OraQuick® HCV test are currently purchased from sole source suppliers. Our OraSure QuickFlu test is manufactured and supplied by a sole source supplier and the conjugates used in our MICROPLATE oral fluid drugs-of-abuse assays are obtained from third party suppliers. In addition, our subsidiary, DNAG, uses two third-party manufacturers to supply virtually all of its products, including its Oragene® line of collection kits. Many of the raw materials and components used in its products are also purchased from third parties, a critical one of which is obtained from a sole source supplier. If our third-party suppliers are unable or unwilling to supply or manufacture a required component or product or if they make changes to a component, product or manufacturing process or do not supply materials meeting our specifications, we may need to find another source and/or manufacturer. This could require that we perform additional development work. We may also need to obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for the use of an alternative component or for changes to our products or manufacturing process. Completing that development and obtaining such approvals could require significant time and expense and such approvals may not occur at all. The availability of critical components and products from sole supply sources or other third parties could also reduce our control over pricing, quality and timely delivery. These events could either disrupt our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products into one or more markets or completely prevent us from doing so, and could increase our costs. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow and business. Our Failure to Maintain Existing Distribution Channels, or Develop New Distribution Channels, May Result in Lower Revenues. We have marketed many of our products by collaborating with laboratories, diagnostic companies and distributors. Our sales depend to a substantial degree on our ability to sell products to these customers and on the marketing and distribution abilities of the companies with which we collaborate. 31 Table of Contents Relying on distributors or others to market and sell our products could harm our business for various reasons, including:  Our distributors or other customers may not fulfill their contractual obligations to us or otherwise market and distribute our products in the manner or at the levels we expect;  We do not control the incentives provided by our distributors to their sales personnel and the effectiveness of these incentives could affect sales of our products;  Agreements with distributors may terminate prematurely due to disagreements or may result in litigation between the parties;  We may not be able to renew existing distribution agreements on acceptable terms or at all;  Our distributors may not devote sufficient resources or priority to the sale of our products;  Our existing distributor relationships or contracts may preclude or limit us from entering into arrangements with other distributors; and  We may not be able to negotiate future distribution agreements on acceptable terms or at all. Although we will try to maintain and expand our business with distributors and customers and require that they fulfill their contractual obligations, there can be no assurance that such companies will do so or that new distribution channels will be available on satisfactory terms. As a result, our revenues and business could be adversely affected. The Unavailability of an FDA-Approved HIV-1 EIA Screening Test Distributed by a Third Party Could Adversely Affect Sales of Our OraSure® Oral Fluid Collection Device. In testing an oral fluid sample collected with an OraSure® device for HIV-1 in the United States, our customers must use an HIV-1 EIA screening test approved by the FDA for use with our OraSure® collection device. There is currently only one company, Avioq, Inc., that manufactures and sells such an FDA-approved screening test. If at some point in the future our customers cannot purchase the Avioq HIV-1 EIA or otherwise obtain an HIV-1 EIA screening test that has been approved by the FDA for use with our OraSure® collection device, sales of our OraSure® device could be negatively affected. We May Need Strategic Partners to Assist in Developing and Commercializing Some of Our Diagnostic Products. Although we may elect to pursue some product opportunities independently, opportunities that require a technology controlled by a third party, a significant level of investment for development and commercialization or a distribution network beyond our existing sales force may necessitate involving one or more strategic partners. Our strategy for development and commercialization of products may entail entering into arrangements with distributors or other corporate partners, universities, research laboratories, licensees and others. Relying on collaborative relationships could be risky to our business for a number of reasons, including:  We may be required to transfer material rights to such strategic partners, licensees and others;  Our collaborators may not devote sufficient resources or attach a sufficiently high priority to the success of our collaboration;  Our collaborators may not obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner;  Our collaborators may be acquired by another company, decide to terminate our collaborative arrangement or become insolvent; 32 Table of Contents  Our collaborators may develop technologies or components competitive with our products;  Disagreements with collaborators could result in the termination of the relationship or litigation;  Collaborators may not have sufficient capital resources; and  We may not be able to negotiate future collaborative arrangements, or renewals of existing collaborative agreements, on acceptable terms or at all. While we generally expect that our collaborative partners will have an economic motivation to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities, there is no assurance that they will do so and the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities will be controlled by others. Consequently, there can be no assurance that any revenues or profits will be derived from such arrangements. Actions of Third-Party Inventory Management and Logistics Providers Could Adversely Affect Our Ability to Supply Products to Our Customers. We use third-party logistics providers to store and manage our finished goods inventory and ship finished product to our customers. We have selected highly reputable providers with extensive experience in the logistics field for these services. However, in the event any of our providers lose or damage our products, experience a casualty or catastrophic event at a warehouse or otherwise fail to provide safe storage and timely handling and delivery of our products, we could incur additional costs, experience difficulty in supplying our products to our customers or suffer damage to our reputation in the industry. These events could, in turn, reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations. Risks Relating to Intellectual Property Our Success Depends on Our Ability to Protect Our Proprietary Technology. The diagnostics industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection, as well as other intellectual property rights, for new technologies, products and processes. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain a strong intellectual property portfolio or obtain licenses to patents and technologies both in the United States and in other countries. If we cannot continue to develop, obtain and protect intellectual property rights, our revenue and gross profits could be adversely affected. Moreover, our current and future licenses or other rights to patents and other technologies may not be adequate for the operation of our business. As appropriate, we intend to file patent applications and obtain patent protection for our proprietary technology. These patent applications and patents will cover, as applicable, compositions of matter for our products, methods of making those products, methods of using those products and apparatus relating to the use or manufacture of those products. However, there have been recent changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which may impact our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, in September 2011, the U.S. enacted sweeping changes to the U.S. patent system under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, including changes that would transition the U.S. from a first-to-invent system to a first-to-file system and alter the processes for challenging issued patents. These changes could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancements to protect our proprietary technology. We have entered, and will continue to enter, into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators. Our employees and third-party consultants also sign agreements 33 Table of Contents requiring that they assign to us interests in inventions and original expressions and any patents or copyrights arising from their work. However, these parties may not honor these agreements. We cannot guarantee that the process of filing patents, the laws governing trade secrets and proprietary information, or any agreements we enter into with employees, consultants, advisors or collaborators will provide adequate protection of our intellectual property rights. For example, employees, consultants and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property, and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach. We also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, as many countries do not offer the same level of legal protection for intellectual property as the United States. Furthermore, for a variety of reasons, we may decide not to file for patent, copyright or trademark protection outside of the U.S. Our trade secrets could become known through other unforeseen means. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property, our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology. Our competitors may also develop similar products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights or design around our proprietary technologies. Moreover, issued patents remain in effect for a fixed period and after expiration will not provide protection of the inventions they cover. Once our patents expire, we may be faced with increased competition, which could reduce our revenues. We may also not be able to successfully protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Some of our employees, including scientific and management personnel, were previously employed by competing companies. Although we encourage and expect all of our employees to abide by any confidentiality agreement with a prior employer, competing companies may allege trade secret violations and similar claims against us. We may collaborate with universities and governmental research organizations which, as a result, may acquire part of the rights to any inventions or technical information derived from our collaboration with them. To facilitate development and commercialization of a proprietary technology base, we may need to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from other parties. Obtaining and maintaining such licenses may require the payment of substantial amounts. In addition, if we are unable to obtain these types of licenses, our product development and commercialization efforts may be delayed or precluded. We May Become Involved in Intellectual Property Disputes, Which Could Increase our Costs and Limit or Eliminate Our Ability to Sell Products or Use Certain Technologies. From time to time, we may seek to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights through litigation. In addition, there are a large number of patents and patent applications in our product areas, and additional patents may be issued to third parties relating to our product areas. We or our customers may be sued for infringement of patents or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights with respect to one or more of our products. Litigation in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights is prevalent and is expected to continue. We may also have disputes with parties that license patents to us if we believe the license is no longer needed for our products or the licensed patents are no longer valid or enforceable. Our industry is characterized by a large number of patents, and the claims of these patents appear to overlap in many cases. As a result, there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the extent of patent protection and infringement. Companies may have pending patent applications, which are typically confidential for the first eighteen months following filing, that cover technologies we incorporate in our products. Accordingly, we may be subjected to substantial damages for past infringement or be required to modify our products or stop selling them if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe a third partys proprietary rights. In addition, governmental agencies could commence investigations or criminal proceedings against our employees or us relating to claims of misuse or misappropriation of another partys proprietary rights. 34 Table of Contents Our involvement in litigation or other legal proceedings with respect to patents or other intellectual property and proprietary technology, either as a plaintiff or defendant, could adversely affect our revenues, market share, results of operations and business because:  As is common with major litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of managerial and financial resources;  Its outcome would be uncertain and a court may find that our patents are invalid or unenforceable in response to claims by another party or that the third-party patent claims are valid and infringed by our products;  An adverse outcome could subject us to the loss of the protection of our patents or to liability in the form of past royalty payments, penalties, reimbursement of litigation costs and legal fees, special and punitive damages, or future royalty payments, any of which could significantly affect our future earnings;  Failure to obtain a necessary license upon an adverse outcome could prevent us from selling our current products or other products we may develop or acquire;  The pendency of any litigation may in and of itself cause our distributors and customers to reduce or terminate purchases of our products; and  A court could award a preliminary and/or permanent injunction, which would prevent us from selling our current or future products. We may indemnify some customers and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if our products or activities have actually or allegedly infringed upon, misappropriated or misused another partys proprietary rights. Further, our products may contain technology provided to us by other parties, such as contractors, suppliers or customers, and we may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. These other parties may also not be required or financially able to indemnify us in the event that an infringement or misappropriation claim is asserted against us. We may also become involved in other types of disputes regarding intellectual property rights, including state, federal or foreign court litigation, and patent interference, patent reexamination, patent reissue, or trademark opposition proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Opposition or revocation proceedings could be instituted in a foreign patent office as well. An adverse decision in any proceeding regarding intellectual property rights could result in the loss or limitation of our rights to a patent, an invention or trademark. The Sales Potential for Our OraQuick® Products Could be Affected by Our Ability to Obtain Certain Licenses and by Future Litigation. Our OraQuick® test platform is a lateral flow assay that tests for specific antibodies or other substances. The term lateral flow generally refers to a test strip through which a sample flows and which provides a test result on a portion of the strip downstream from where the sample is applied. There are numerous patents in the United States and other countries which claim lateral flow assay methods and devices. There are also patents that cover the type of analyte or antibody (i.e., HIV-1, HIV-2, HCV, etc.) which our OraQuick® test is designed to detect. Some of these patents may broadly cover the aspects of our OraQuick® test and are in force in the United States and other countries. We may not be able to make or sell the OraQuick® test in the United States or other countries where these patents are in force. We have obtained licenses under several lateral flow patents, and patents covering assays directed at specific analytes, which we believe are sufficient to permit the manufacturing and sale of the OraQuick® device as currently contemplated. However, licenses under additional patents may be required and it is possible that a third party could seek to enforce one or more patents against us. 35 Table of Contents If we are unable to successfully defend against or resolve patent infringement litigation or it is determined that a license is required and it is not possible to negotiate or otherwise obtain a license agreement on reasonable terms under a necessary patent, our ability to manufacture and sell OraQuick® devices and develop and commercialize new applications using the same technology could be limited and we may incur increased costs or damages. In such case, we may be able to modify the OraQuick® test to avoid the claim of infringement or the need for a license. However, this alternative could preclude or limit our ability to sell the OraQuick® test in the United States and other markets, which would adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and business. Risks Relating to Products, Marketing and Sales Our Future Success Depends Upon Market Acceptance of Our Existing and Future Products. Our future success will depend, in part, on the market acceptance, and the timing of such acceptance, of new products such as our OraQuick® HCV test, our OraQuick® In-Home HIV test, and other new products or technologies that may be developed or acquired. To achieve market acceptance, we and/or our distributors will likely be required to undertake substantial marketing efforts and spend significant funds to inform potential customers and the public of the existence and perceived benefits of these products. In addition, governmental funding for the purchase of our products may be needed to help create market acceptance and expand the use of our products. There may be limited evidence on which to evaluate the market reaction to products that may be developed and our marketing efforts for new products may not be successful. It is also possible that governmental funding may be limited for new products, such as our OraQuick® HCV test. As such, there can be no assurance that any products will obtain significant market acceptance and fill the market need that is perceived to exist on a timely basis, or at all. If Acceptance and Adoption of Oral Fluid Testing and Collection Products Does Not Continue, Our Future Results May Suffer. We have made significant progress in gaining acceptance of oral fluid testing products, particularly for (i) HIV testing in the public health, hospital, insurance and other markets, and (ii) drugs-of-abuse testing in the workplace and criminal justice markets. Our subsidiary, DNAG, has also made significant progress in gaining acceptance of oral fluid collection products that are used with molecular testing applications. However, the degree of acceptance for these products is uncertain, and one or more markets may resist the adoption of oral fluid products as a replacement for other testing or collection methods in use today. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to expand the use of our oral fluid testing products in these or other markets. Our Customers May Resist Adoption of Rapid Point-of-Care Diagnostic Testing. Sales of our rapid point-of-care diagnostic products, such as our OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV-1/2 and OraQuick® HCV tests, are an important part of our business. Rapid point-of-care tests are beneficial to healthcare providers because, among other things, they can be administered by providers in their own facilities without sending samples to central laboratories and can help ensure that test results are delivered to the individuals being tested. However, clinical reference laboratories and hospital-based laboratories currently provide the majority of diagnostic tests used by physicians and other healthcare providers in the U.S. In certain international markets such as Europe, diagnostic testing is performed primarily by centralized laboratories. Our future sales will depend, in part, on our ability to expand market acceptance of rapid point-of-care testing by physicians and other healthcare providers and successfully compete against laboratory testing methods and products. We expect that clinical reference and other hospital-based laboratories will continue to compete vigorously against our rapid point-of-care products. Even if we can demonstrate that our products are more cost effective, save time, or have 36 Table of Contents better performance or other benefits, physicians and other healthcare providers may resist changing to rapid point-of-care tests and instead may choose to use competing laboratory tests. Our failure to achieve and expand market acceptance of our rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests with customers would have a negative effect on our future sales growth. We Expect to Face Intense Competition From Other Providers of Diagnostic Tests and Sample Collection Products. Our rapid point-of-care tests compete with similar point-of-care products made by our competitors. This competition is particularly evident with respect to our OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV-1/2 test. In addition, the Oragene® product line sold by our subsidiary, DNAG, competes against other molecular collection products, such as blood collection kits and buccal swabs. There are a number of competitors making investments in competing technologies and products, and a number of our competitors may have a competitive advantage because of their greater financial, technical, research and other resources. Some competitors offer broader product lines, aggressively discount prices for their products and may have greater name recognition than we have. If our competitors products take market share from our products through more effective marketing or competitive pricing, our revenues, margins and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, our revenues and operating results could be negatively impacted if some of our customers internally develop or acquire their own sample collection devices and use those devices in place of our products in order to reduce costs. Our Future Growth Depends, In Part, on Our Ability to Commercialize the OraQuick® In-Home HIV Test. Our future growth will depend, in part, on our ability to commercialize and market the OraQuick® In-Home HIV test in the OTC market. Successful commercialization of the OraQuick® In-Home HIV test will depend on a number of factors, including achieving widespread awareness and adoption of the product among the targeted consumer base, initiating and maintaining relationships with suppliers and retailers, reducing the use of security devices and other barriers to purchase in retail stores, protecting against and effectively responding to any claims by holders of patents and other intellectual property rights that our OTC product infringes their rights, obtaining and maintaining sufficient inventory of the product, the performance of our toll-free customer support center and our comprehensive consumer website relating to the product, and our ability to successfully market the product at the projected selling price. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in these endeavors. Because of the need to build broad awareness for this new product, our advertising and marketing expenditures have been substantial. If we continue advertising and marketing expenditures consistent with historic levels, our operating results will be negatively impacted unless we are successful in substantially increasing sales of this product. Conversely, if we decide to reduce these expenditures, our costs will be lower but sales of our OraQuick® In-Home test could be adversely impacted. In addition, retailers generally have broad product return rights which may be exercised if sufficiently high sales to consumers are not achieved. Successful commercialization of this product will also depend on whether any unanticipated adverse effects result from use of the product, or unfavorable publicity develops in respect of the product, as well as the emergence of new or existing products as competition, which are proven to be more clinically or cost-effective. Sales of Our OraSure QuickFlu Test May be Affected by Factors Beyond Our Control. We sell a rapid flu test under the tradename OraSure QuickFlu, primarily in the U.S. hospital and public health markets. A number of factors that are beyond our control could affect sales of this product, including:  Variability in the timing of the onset, length and severity of the flu season, which typically occurs from November of one year to May of the following year;  Competition from other rapid flu tests in the markets we serve; 37 Table of Contents  Deficiencies in the manufacture, design or performance of the product or failure by the manufacturer to meet applicable quality and regulatory standards;  The inability of our supplier to provide sufficient quantities of the product;  Changes in the types or strains of influenza during a particular flu season;  Lower than expected market penetration of the OraSure QuickFlu test; and  Our inexperience in selling a rapid flu test. Our Inability to Carry Out Certain of Our Marketing and Sales Plans May Make it Difficult for Us to Grow or Maintain Our Business. We have implemented in the past, and we intend to implement in the future, an aggressive sales and marketing plan to expand sales of our products. Specifically, we will continue to expand the impact of our direct field sales force, use third-party distributors and manufacturers sales representatives, and implement other sales and marketing programs. If we are unable to successfully implement these programs or modify these programs in response to evolving market and economic conditions, we may be unable to grow and our business could suffer. Our Sales Cycles Can be Lengthy, and May Depend on Public Funding, Which Can Cause Variability and Unpredictability in Our Operating Results. The sales cycles for certain of our products can be lengthy and unpredictable, which makes it more difficult to accurately forecast revenues in a given period and may cause revenues and operating results to vary from period to period. Sales of our products often involve purchasing decisions by large public and private institutions, may require many levels of approval and may be dependent on economic or political conditions and the availability of grants or funding from governmental or public health agencies which can vary from period to period in both amount and timing. For example, in past years our OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV-1/2 test has been purchased through bulk procurement or other funding provided by governmental agencies. Our OraQuick® HCV test has been purchased by customers who receive government funding, and we believe increased funding from the CDC and other agencies will be required to substantially increase the volume of HCV testing, especially in the public health market. There can be no assurance that purchases or funding from these agencies will occur or continue, especially if current negative economic conditions continue or intensify. As a result, we may expend considerable resources on unsuccessful sales efforts or we may not be able to complete transactions at all or on a schedule and in an amount consistent with our objectives. We May Face Product Liability Claims for Injuries Resulting From the Use of Our Products. We may be held liable if any of our products, or any product which is made with the use or incorporation of any of our technologies, causes injury of any type or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing, sale or usage. There is no assurance that we would be successful in defending any product liability lawsuits brought against us. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims could result in:  Decreased demand for our products;  Lost revenues;  Damage to our image or reputation;  Costs related to litigation;  Diversion of management time and attention; and  Incurrence of damages payable to plaintiffs. 38 Table of Contents We are selling cryosurgical products in the consumer or OTC market in certain countries and we may expand OTC sales of these products into other countries. We also launched the OraQuick® In-Home HIV test in the United States OTC market, and we are considering the expansion of this product internationally. We believe the sale of products in the OTC market increases our potential exposure to product liability and other claims. The Insurance We Purchase to Cover Our Potential Business Risks May be Inadequate. Although we believe that our present product liability and other insurance coverage is sufficient to cover our current estimated exposures, we cannot be sure that we will not incur liabilities in excess of our policy limits. In addition, although we believe that we will be able to continue to obtain adequate coverage in the future, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so at acceptable costs. We Could Suffer Monetary Damages, Incur Substantial Costs or be Prevented From Using Technologies Important to Our Products as a Result of Legal Proceedings. We have been and in the future may become involved in various legal proceedings arising out of our businesses. These may include commercial disputes, negligence claims or various other lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business, including employment matters. Such lawsuits can seek damages, sometimes in substantial amounts, for commercial or personal injuries allegedly suffered and can include claims for punitive or other special damages. An adverse ruling or rulings in one or more such lawsuits could, individually or in the aggregate, result in the termination or modification of a material contract or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our sales, operations or financial performance. Performance of Our Products May Affect Our Revenues, Stock Price and Reputation. Our products are generally sold with labeling that contains performance claims approved or cleared by the FDA or other regulators. However, our products may not perform as expected. For example, a defect in one of our diagnostic products or a failure by a customer to follow proper testing procedures, may cause the product to report inaccurate information such as a false positive result or a false negative result. A false positive or negative result can also occur even when there is no apparent product defect and the customer has apparently used our product properly. Identifying the root cause of a product performance or quality issue can be difficult and time consuming. If our products fail to perform in accordance with the applicable label claims or otherwise in accordance with the expectations or needs of our customers, customers may switch to a competing product or otherwise stop using our products, and our revenues could be adversely affected. Under such circumstances, we may be required to implement shipment holds or product recalls and incur warranty obligations, which would increase our costs. In addition, poor performance by one or more of our products and publicity surrounding such performance could have an adverse effect on our reputation, our continuing ability to sell products and the prevailing market price of our Common Stock. Our International Presence May Increase Our Risks and Expose Our Business to Regulatory, Cultural or Other Restraints. We seek to increase revenue derived from international sales of our products. Our international sales accounted for $21.7 million or 22% of consolidated net revenues in 2013, $20.3 million or 23% of consolidated net revenues in 2012 and $14.2 million or 17% of consolidated net revenues in 2011. In addition, our molecular collection systems business, which accounted for $20.4 million or 21% of consolidated net revenues in 2013, is operated in Canada. 39 Table of Contents A number of factors could adversely affect the performance of our business and/or cause us to incur substantially increased costs because of our international presence and sales, including those set forth below:  Uncertainty in the application of foreign laws and the interpretation of contracts with foreign parties;  The potential for inconsistent imposition of legal and regulatory requirements;  Cultural and political differences that favor local competitors or make it difficult to effectively market, sell and gain acceptance of our products;  Inexperience in international markets and territories and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;  Exchange rates, currency fluctuations, tariffs and other barriers, extended payment terms and dependence on international distributors or representatives;  Regulatory requirements (including compliance with applicable customs regulations) and the need for reimbursement approvals;  The inability to obtain or maintain ISO certification for our or our suppliers manufacturing facilities;  Our inability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals or registrations for our products;  Our inability to identify international distributors and negotiate acceptable terms for distribution agreements;  Diversion to the U.S. of our products sold at lower prices into international markets;  The loss of one or more distributors and difficulties or delays in obtaining new or transferred product registrations or approvals for use by a replacement distributor;  The creditworthiness of foreign distributors and customers and difficulty in collecting foreign accounts receivable;  Difficulty of enforcing contractual obligations or recovering damages under foreign legal systems;  Economic conditions, political instability, the absence of available funding sources, terrorism, civil unrest, war and natural disasters in foreign countries;  Our exposure to liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and various other laws, rules and/or regulations applicable to us as a result of our international sales;  Long sales cycles in international markets, especially for sales to foreign governments, quasi-governmental agencies and international public health agencies;  The sale of competing products by foreign competitors at prices at or below the prices we offer for our products;  Restrictions on our ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations;  Changes in shipping costs;  The unavailability of licenses to certain patents in force in a foreign country which cover our products; and  Reduced protection for, or enforcement of, our patents and other intellectual property rights in foreign countries. 40 Table of Contents In addition, we have contracted with a third party in Thailand for the manufacture of a portion of our OraQuick® HIV-1/2 tests, and all of DNAGs products are produced in Canada. In addition, the Histofreezer® cryosurgical product sold in international markets is currently manufactured by a third party in The Netherlands. We may enter into agreements to manufacture these or other products in additional foreign countries as well. However, economic, cultural and political conditions and foreign regulatory requirements may slow or prevent the manufacture of our products in countries other than the United States. Interruption of the supply of our products could reduce revenues or cause us to incur significant additional expenses in finding an alternative source of supply. Foreign currency fluctuations and economic conditions in foreign countries could also increase the costs of manufacturing our products in foreign countries. Risks Relating to the Economy, Our Financial Results, Investments, Credit Facilities and Need for Financing Continued Economic Volatility and Disruption Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Cash Flow and Financial Condition or Those of Our Customers and Suppliers. Current volatile economic conditions may continue for the foreseeable future and intensify. These conditions have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial performance and condition or those of our customers and suppliers. These circumstances could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed to conduct or expand our business or conduct future acquisitions or make other discretionary investments. Many of our customers rely on public funding provided by federal, state and local governments, and this funding has been and may continue to be reduced or deferred as a result of economic conditions. These circumstances may adversely impact our customers and suppliers, which, in turn, could adversely affect their ability to purchase our products or supply us with necessary equipment, raw materials or components. Even with the improvement of economic conditions, it may take time for our customers and suppliers to establish new budgets and return to normal purchasing and shipping patterns. We cannot predict the reoccurrence of any economic slowdown or the strength or sustainability of the economic recovery. We Have a History of Losses and May Not Be Able to Achieve Sustained Profitability. We have experienced annual net losses since 2008. In addition, as of December 31, 2013, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $173.7 million. Even though we achieved profitability a number of years ago, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability in the future will be dependent upon a number of factors including, without limitation, the following:  Creating market acceptance for and selling increasing volumes of our OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV-1/2 test and our OraQuick® HCV test in the United States and internationally;  Our ability to successfully commercialize our OraQuick® In-Home HIV test and the magnitude of promotional costs related to this product;  The success and revenue growth of our molecular collection systems business;  The level of expenditures we are required to make in order to develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize our new products;  Our ability to successfully launch new products after receipt of required regulatory approvals or the acquisition of rights to those products;  The degree to which our major distributors comply with their contractual obligations, including minimum purchase commitments;  Whether we are successful in obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approvals and registrations for our new products; 41 Table of Contents  Changes in the level of competition, such as would occur if larger and financially stronger competitors introduced new or lower priced products to compete with our products;  Changes in economic conditions in domestic or international markets, such as economic downturns, reduced demand, inflation and currency fluctuations;  Failure to achieve our targets for growth in revenues;  Changes in distributor buying patterns or a buildup of significant quantities in our distributors inventories or distribution channels; and  The costs and results of patent infringement, product liability and other litigation or claims asserted against us. We May Experience Fluctuations in Our Financial Results or Fail to Meet Our Financial Projections. Our operating results can fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, which could cause our growth or financial performance to fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts. Our financial projections for future periods are based on a number of assumptions, including estimated demand for our products. However, sales to our distributors and other customers may fall short of expectations because of lower than estimated customer demand or other factors, including continued volatility and disruption in economic conditions, increasing competition, reduced governmental funding and other circumstances described elsewhere in this Annual Report. Infrequent, unusual or unexpected changes in revenues or costs could also contribute to the variability of our financial results. In addition, our products provide different contributions to our gross margin. Accordingly, our operating results could also fluctuate and be affected by the mix of products sold and the relative prices and gross margin contribution of those products. Failure to achieve operating results consistent with the expectations of investors and securities analysts could adversely affect our reputation and the price of our Common Stock. Our Estimates or Judgments Relating to Critical Accounting Policies Are Based on Assumptions That Can Change or Prove to be Incorrect. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements, including those related to:  Revenue recognition;  Potential impairment of long-lived and intangible assets including goodwill;  Customer sales returns and allowances;  Allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable;  Reserve for inventory write-downs;  Stock-based compensation;  Income taxes; and  Contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of 42 Table of Contents operations, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these and other estimates if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results. Our financial statements are stated in U.S. Dollars and, historically, most of our international sales have also been denominated in U.S. Dollars. As a result, in the past our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk has not been material. Nonetheless, these sales are subject to currency risks, since changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the U.S. dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive. These exchange rate fluctuations could negatively impact international sales of our products, as could changes in the general economic conditions in those markets. In addition, the revenues and operating results of our subsidiary, DNAG, are recorded in Canadian Dollars and certain of its international sales are denominated in local currencies, including the Euro, British Pound and Australian Dollar. In 2013, DNAG reported total revenues of U.S. $20.4 million. Our expectation is that the DNAG business will continue to grow and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates may be more significant than in past years. Exchange rate fluctuations may affect DNAGs revenues and expenses and the translation of DNAGs financial results into U.S. Dollars. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could negatively affect our consolidated financial statements including our balance sheet, revenues and results of operations. In the past, we have not generally entered into hedging instruments to manage our currency exchange rate risk, but we may need to do so in the future. However, our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful. If we are unable to successfully hedge against unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements, our consolidated financial results may be adversely impacted. Changes in Tax Laws or Their Application Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations. Changes in tax laws or their application could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations. Such changes could affect applicable tax rates, utilization of tax loss carryforwards, and treatment of inter-company debt and interest payments. We May Require Future Additional Capital. Our future liquidity and ability to meet our future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following:  The costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities;  The timing and success of the commercial launch of new products;  The extent to which we gain or expand market acceptance for existing, new or enhanced products;  The costs and timing of the expansion of our manufacturing capacity;  The success of our research and product development efforts;  The time, cost and degree of success of conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals;  The magnitude of capital expenditures; 43 Table of Contents  Changes in existing and potential relationships with distributors and other business partners;  The costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents, proprietary rights and necessary licenses;  The costs and liability associated with patent infringement or other types of litigation;  Competing technological and market developments; and  The scope and timing of strategic acquisitions. If additional financing is needed, we may seek to raise funds through the sale of equity or other securities or through bank borrowings. There can be no assurance that financing through the sale of securities, bank borrowings or otherwise will be available to us on satisfactory terms, or at all. Terrorist Attacks or Natural Disasters May Adversely Affect Our Business. Terrorist attacks or natural disasters, and subsequent governmental responses to these events, could cause economic instability. These actions could adversely affect economic conditions both within and outside the United States and reduce demand for our products. These events could disrupt the operations of our customers and suppliers and eliminate, reduce or delay our customers ability to purchase and use our products and our suppliers ability to provide raw materials and finished products. Although we have business interruption insurance, our facilities, including some pieces of manufacturing equipment and our computer systems, may be difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead-time. Various types of disasters, including earthquakes, fires, floods and acts of terrorism, may affect our manufacturing facilities and computer systems. In the event our existing manufacturing facilities or computer systems are affected by man-made or natural disasters, we may have difficulty operating our business and may be unable to manufacture products for sale or meet customer demands or sales projections. If our manufacturing operations were curtailed or shut down entirely, it would seriously harm our business. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock Our Stock Price Could Continue to be Volatile. Our stock price has been volatile, has fluctuated substantially in the past, may be volatile in the future and could experience substantial declines. The following factors, among others, could have a significant impact on the market for our Common Stock:  Future announcements concerning us and our products, including with respect to significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations and joint ventures;  The performance of our business, including our efforts to commercialize the OraQuick® In-Home HIV test and increase sales of our HCV testing and molecular collection systems products;  Clinical results with respect to our products or those of our competitors;  The status of clinical studies and pending submissions for required regulatory approvals;  The announcement of regulatory or enforcement actions by the FDA or other agencies against us, our products or one or more of our customers;  The gain or loss of significant contracts and availability of funding for the purchase of our products; 44 Table of Contents  Delays in the development, regulatory approval or commercialization of new or enhanced products;  Legislative developments and industry or competitive trends;  Disputes or developments with key customers, distributors or suppliers;  Developments in patent or other proprietary rights;  Litigation or threatened litigation;  Complaints or concerns about the performance or safety of our products and publicity about those issues, including publicity expressed through social media or otherwise over the internet;  Failure to achieve, or changes in, financial estimates by securities analysts and comments or opinions about us by securities analysts or major stockholders;  Governmental regulation;  Changes in the level of competition;  Loss of or declines in sales to major distributors or customers or changes in the mix of products sold;  The relatively low trading volume for our Common Stock;  Period-to-period fluctuations in our operating results;  Additions or departures of key personnel;  General market and economic conditions; and  Terrorist attacks, civil unrest, war and national disasters. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our Common Stock, as well as the stock of many companies in the diagnostics and life sciences industries. Often, price fluctuations are unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys stock, securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company. If we were subject to this type of litigation in the future, we could incur substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Any adverse determination in this type of litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities. Future Sales of Our Common Stock by Existing Stockholders, Executive Officers or Directors Could Depress the Market Price of Our Common Stock and Make It More Difficult For Us to Sell Stock in the Future. Sales of our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could negatively impact the market price of our Common Stock. We are unable to estimate the number of shares of our Common Stock that may actually be resold in the public market since this will depend on the market price for our Common Stock, the individual circumstances of the sellers and other factors.
