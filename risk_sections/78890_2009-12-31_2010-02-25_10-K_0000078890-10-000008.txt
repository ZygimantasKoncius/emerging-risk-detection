ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We are exposed to risk in the operation of our businesses. Some of these risks are common to all companies doing business in the industries in which we operate and some are unique to our business. In addition, there are risks associated with investing in our common stock. These risk factors should be considered carefully when evaluating the company and its businesses. The weak economy is expected to have a negative impact on demand for our services. Global economic conditions have deteriorated significantly, and demand for our services has been negatively impacted in regions where we provide our services. For example, demand for our services is significantly affected by the amount of discretionary consumer and business spending, which historically has displayed significant cyclicality. Further deterioration in general global economic conditions would have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, although it is difficult to predict the extent and the length of time the economic downturn will affect our business. The inability to access capital or significant increases in the cost of capital could adversely affect our business. Our ability to obtain adequate and cost effective financing depends on our credit ratings as well as the liquidity of financial markets. A negative change in our ratings outlook or any downgrade in our current investment-grade credit ratings by our rating agencies could adversely affect our cost and/or access to sources of liquidity and capital. Additionally, such a downgrade could increase the costs of borrowing under available credit lines. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to access short-term and long-term capital. Our access to funds under short-term credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the participating banks to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity. Longer disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to capital needed for our business. We have significant retirement obligations. Poor investment performance of retirement plan holdings could unfavorably affect our liquidity and results of operations. We have substantial pension and retiree medical obligations, a portion of which have been funded. The amount of these obligations is significantly affected by factors that are not in our control, including interest rates used to determine the present value of future payment streams, investment returns, medical inflation rates, participation rates and changes in laws and regulations. Our liabilities for these plans increased significantly in 2008 primarily as a result of a decline in value of plan investments. To improve the funded status of The Brink’s Company Pension-Retirement Plan, we made a voluntary $150 million cash and stock contribution in 2009. The funded status of the plan was approximately 83% as of December 31, 2009. We expect that we will be required to make significant contributions to The Brink’s Company Pension-Retirement Plan in the next several years. This could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to use our resources to make acquisitions and to otherwise grow our business. The net periodic costs of our retirement plans in 2009 were adversely affected by the investment losses sustained in 2008 and we anticipate that costs in future years will continue to be affected as the unrecognized losses are recognized into earnings. If these investments have additional losses, our future cash requirements and costs for these plans will be further adversely affected. We have significant operations outside the United States. We currently operate in more than 50 countries. Approximately three-quarters of our revenue in 2009 came from operations outside the U.S. We expect revenue outside the U.S. to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenue. Business operations outside the U.S. are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating in foreign countries, such as: · the difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through foreign legal systems; · trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; · difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; · required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; · varying permitting and licensing requirements in different jurisdictions; · changes in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets; · threat of nationalization and expropriation; · higher costs and risks of doing business in a number of foreign jurisdictions; · limitations on the repatriation of earnings; 10 · fluctuations in equity, revenues and profits due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including measures taken by governments to influence currency exchange rates; and · inflation levels exceeding that of the U.S. We are exposed to certain risks when we operate in countries that have high levels of inflation, including the risk that: · the rate of price increases for services will not keep pace with cost inflation; · adverse economic conditions may discourage business growth which could affect demand for our services; · the devaluation of the currency may exceed the rate of inflation and reported U.S. dollar revenues and profits may decline; and · these countries may be deemed “highly inflationary” for U.S. GAAP purposes. We try to manage these risks by monitoring current and anticipated political and economic developments and adjusting operations as appropriate. Changes in the political or economic environments of the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We operate in highly competitive industries. We compete in industries that are subject to significant competition and pricing pressures. We face significant pricing pressures from competitors in most markets. Because we believe we have competitive advantages such as brand name recognition and a reputation for a high level of service and security, we resist competing on price alone. However, continued pricing pressure could impact our customer base or pricing structure and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our earnings and cash flow could be materially affected by increased losses of customer valuables. We purchase insurance coverage for losses of customer valuables for amounts in excess of what we consider prudent deductibles and/or retentions. Insurance is provided by different groups of underwriters at negotiated rates and terms. Coverage is available to us in major insurance markets, although premiums charged are subject to fluctuations depending on market conditions. Our loss experience and that of other armored carriers affects premium rates charged to us. We are self-insured for losses below our coverage limits and recognize expense up to these limits for actual losses. Our insurance policies cover losses from most causes, with the exception of war, nuclear risk and various other exclusions typical for such policies. The availability of high-quality and reliable insurance coverage is an important factor in order for us to obtain and retain customers and to manage the risks of our business. If our losses increase, or if we are unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Restructuring charges may be required in the future. There is a possibility we will take restructuring actions in one or more of our markets in the future to reduce expenses if a major customer is lost or if recurring operating losses continue. These actions could result in significant restructuring charges at these subsidiaries, including recognizing impairment charges to write down assets, and recording accruals for employee severance and operating leases. These charges, if required, could significantly affect results of operations and cash flows. We depend heavily on the availability of fuel and the ability to pass higher fuel costs to customers. Fuel prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years. In some periods, our operating profit has been adversely affected because we are not able to immediately offset the full impact of higher fuel prices through increased prices or fuel surcharges. We do not have any long-term fuel purchase contracts, and have not entered into any other hedging arrangements that protect against fuel price increases. A significant increase in fuel costs and an inability to pass increases on to customers or a shortage of fuel could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. We operate in regulated industries. Our U.S. operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation with respect to safety of operations and equipment and financial responsibility. Intrastate operations in the U.S. are subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities and interprovincial operations in Canada are subject to regulation by Canadian and provincial regulatory authorities. Our international operations are regulated to varying degrees by the countries in which we operate. Changes in laws or regulations could require a change in the way we operate, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses. If laws and regulations were to change or we failed to comply, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 11 We have retained obligations from the sale of BAX Global. In January 2006 we sold BAX Global. We retained some of the obligations related to these operations, primarily for taxes owed prior to the date of sale and for any amounts paid related to one pending litigation matter for which we have accrued a loss reserve of $13 million. In addition, we provided indemnification customary for these sorts of transactions. Future unfavorable developments related to these matters could require us to record additional expenses or make cash payments in excess of recorded liabilities. The occurrence of these events could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are subject to covenants for credit facilities. We have credit facilities with financial covenants, including a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, limits on the ability to pledge assets, limits on the use of proceeds of asset sales and minimum coverage of interest costs. Although we believe none of these covenants are presently restrictive to operations, the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by changes in our results of operations or financial condition. We cannot provide assurance that we will meet these covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under existing credit facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities, the lenders could cause amounts outstanding to be immediately payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. The occurrence of these events would have a significant impact on our liquidity and cash flows. Our growth strategy may not be successful. One element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and expand our geographic reach through selective acquisitions. Acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. There can be no assurance · that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, · that all future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings, · or that future acquisitions will be rapidly and efficiently integrated into existing operations. Our effective income tax rate could change. We operate in more than 50 countries, all of which have different income tax laws and associated income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate can be significantly affected by changes in the mix of pretax earnings by country and the related income tax rates in those countries. In addition, our effective income tax rate is significantly affected by the ability to realize deferred tax assets, including those associated with net operating losses. Changes in income tax laws, income apportionment, or estimates of the ability to realize deferred tax assets, could significantly affect our effective income tax rate, financial position and results of operations. We have certain environmental and other exposures related to our former coal operations. We may incur future environmental and other liabilities that are presently unknown in connection with our former coal operations. Our performance could be negatively impacted by the spin-off of BHS, which was completed in 2008. In connection with the BHS spin-off, we received both a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and a favorable opinion from Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP that the spin-off qualifies for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. However, the IRS could subsequently determine that the spin-off should be treated as a taxable transaction. If the spin-off fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, it could have a material adverse tax impact on us as well as on our shareholders. We also entered into certain agreements with BHS that could potentially affect our ability to conduct our operations in the manner most advantageous to us until the expiration of such agreements. We have agreed to license certain trademarks that contain the word “Brink’s” to BHS until October 31, 2011, subject to earlier termination. We also have agreed not to compete with BHS in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico with respect to certain activities related to BHS’s security system monitoring and surveillance business until October 31, 2013. 12 We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change. Growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations to which we are subject. Some form of federal regulation may be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide (CO2)) and/or "cap and trade" legislation. The outcome of this legislation may result in new regulation, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions. Compliance with these actions could result in the creation of additional costs to us, including, among other things, increased fuel prices or additional taxes or emission allowances. We may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations from our customers, which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, the potential impacts of climate change and related regulation on our customers are highly uncertain and may adversely affect our operations.
