Item 1A. Risk Factors We operate in a dynamic, rapidly changing and challenging environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties described below could individually or collectively have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, profitability or prospects. While these are not the only risks and uncertainties we face, management believes that the more significant risks and uncertainties are as follows: The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to attract key personnel could weaken our ability to deliver quality services and could adversely affect our business. We are substantially dependent on certain key employees, including the services of our executive management team, to direct efforts related to execution of our strategic plan. We are also dependent on certain sales and recruiting personnel to maintain critical existing customer and consultant relationships and attract new business. The loss of one or more of these key personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations, including our ability to execute our strategic plan, maintain existing customer relationships, recruit qualified consultants or attract new clients in the context of changing economic or competitive conditions. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel to perform these services, our business, the results of our operations and our financial condition could be adversely affected. Our success also depends upon our ability to attract qualified IT professionals who possess the skills, competencies and experience necessary to meet the requirements of our clients. We must continually recruit and retain qualified IT professionals who meet the needs of changing customer requirements, and our growth could be limited by our ability to do so. Competition for qualified personnel is strong and IT professional turnover rates remain high. If we are unable to hire or retain the talent required by our clients in a timely, cost-effective manner, negotiate mutually beneficial pay rates and benefit packages or have our new professionals achieve acceptable levels of productivity on a timely basis, it will affect our ability to successfully operate our business. Intense competition within the IT staffing industry may result in a loss of market share or lower bill rates, either of which could adversely affect our business. The market for our services is extremely competitive and fragmented, with limited barriers to entry. Intense price competition in the area of IT staffing, continued pressure on bill rates, and clients' 7 Table of Contents continued requests for discounts, rebates and price concessions involving lower cost models for IT staffing services, are likely to continue to exert downward pressure on our operating results and could adversely affect our operating results. Management expects that our clients will continue, for the foreseeable future, to request lower cost offerings for IT staffing services through e-procurement systems, extremely competitive bidding processes, the granting of various types of discounts, engagement of vendor management organizations and the use of offshore resources, all of which tend to lower our gross margins. There has been a significant increase in the number of clients consolidating their staffing services purchases with a single provider or with a small number of providers. The trend to consolidate staffing vendor relationships has in some cases made it more difficult for us to obtain or retain clients. We also face the risk that certain of our current and prospective clients may decide to procure similar services internally. Our ability to respond to client requests for lower pricing or to provide other low-cost services will have a direct effect on our performance. If we are unable to maintain or increase (a) the number of hours billed by our IT professionals, (b) their current billing and/or utilization rates or (c) the gross margins we realize from their work, our financial results will be negatively affected. Our gross margins, and therefore our profitability, are largely a function of the rates we charge for our services and the utilization rate, or chargeability, of our IT professionals. Accordingly, if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or an appropriate utilization rate for our IT professionals, we will not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer. Additionally, intense competition, especially in IT staffing, may also require us to accept less favorable contractual terms, especially in the area of limitations of liability (with respect to both direct and consequential damages) and indemnification. We are also experiencing pressure from some clients who desire to utilize companies with larger market capitalization than ours and/or global delivery capability for their IT staffing needs. We do not have an "offshore" outsourcing or development center and do not have any strategic alliances with a partner to provide offshore services. Additionally, many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have and as a result, may be able to adjust to changing market conditions and respond to client demands more effectively. They may also have greater resources to devote to the development of new technologies, products and services. It is possible that new competitors, alliances among competitors or alliances between competitors and third parties may emerge and acquire significant market share. If this were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We expect highly competitive conditions in the market for IT staffing services to continue for the foreseeable future. Our client contracts are typically short term and subject to cancellation without penalty. We provide services to our clients under contracts that can generally be cancelled without penalty and upon short notice. These cancellations could result from factors that are beyond our control and are unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project, but could be related to business or financial conditions of the client, changes in client strategies or economic conditions in general. When contracts are cancelled, we lose the anticipated future revenue and gross margin and we may be unable to eliminate our associated cost or reassign our IT professionals in a timely manner. The cancellation or reduction in scope of an engagement could, therefore, reduce the utilization rate of our IT professionals, which would have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be subject to liability to our clients under certain circumstances. If we do not meet our contractual obligations to a client, we may be subject to legal liability to our client. Our contracts typically include provisions to limit our exposure to legal claims arising from the services we provide; however, these provisions may not protect us, or may not be enforceable under 8 Table of Contents some circumstances or under the laws of some jurisdictions. If we cannot or do not fulfill our obligations or have adequate contract protection, we could face legal liability. Although we maintain professional liability insurance, the policy limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all potential liabilities. In addition, if we were to fail to deliver services properly, we may not be able to collect any related accounts receivable or could be required to refund amounts paid by the client. The protection of client, employee and company data is critical to our business. Our clients have an expectation that we will adequately protect their confidential information, and we are subject to various laws and regulations that require us to maintain the confidentiality of client and employee information. If any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients. We have adopted a shareholder rights plan and other charter provisions that could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of the Company or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock. We have adopted a Rights Agreement, commonly known as a "poison pill," under which each stockholder of the Company holds one share purchase right, which we refer to as a Right, for each share of Company common stock held. The Rights become exercisable upon the occurrence of certain events and may make the acquisition of our Company more difficult and expensive. In addition, our bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our Company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors, including a provision requiring shareowners intending to make a director nomination or bring other business at a shareowner meeting to have provided the Company advance written notice of such nominations or business, generally not less than 120 days before the shareowner meeting.
