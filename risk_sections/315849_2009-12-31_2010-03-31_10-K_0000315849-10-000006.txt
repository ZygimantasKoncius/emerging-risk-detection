BUSINESS Southwest Georgia Financial Corporation (the "Corporation") is a Georgia bank holding company organized in 1980, which, in 1981, acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Southwest Georgia Bank (the "Bank"). The Bank commenced operations as Moultrie National Bank in 1928. Currently, it is a FDIC insured, state-chartered bank. The Corporation's primary business is providing banking services through the Bank to individuals and businesses principally in Colquitt County, Baker County, Thomas County, Worth County, and the surrounding counties of southwest Georgia. The Bank also operates Empire Financial Services, Inc. ("Empire"), a commercial mortgage banking firm located in Baldwin County, and a loan production office located in Lowndes County. Currently, the Bank is constructing a new full-service banking center in Lowndes County that will replace the loan production office. The Corporation's executive office is located at 201 First Street, S. E., Moultrie, Georgia 31768, and its telephone number is (229) 985-1120. All references herein to the Corporation include Southwest Georgia Financial Corporation, the Bank, and Empire, unless the context indicates a different meaning. General The Corporation is a registered bank holding company. All of the Corporation's activities are currently conducted by the Bank and Empire. The Bank is community-oriented and offers such customary banking services as consumer and commercial checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, lines of credit, VISA business accounts, and money transfers. The Bank finances commercial and consumer transactions, makes secured and unsecured loans, and provides a variety of other banking services. The Bank has a trust and investment division that performs corporate, pension, and personal trust services and acts as trustee, executor, and administrator for estates and as administrator or trustee of various types of employee benefit plans for corporations and other organizations. Also, the trust and investment area has a securities sales department which offers full-service brokerage through a third party service provider. The Bank operates Southwest Georgia Insurance Services Division, an insurance agency that offers property and casualty insurance, life, health, and disability insurance. Empire, a subsidiary of the Bank, is a commercial mortgage banking firm that offers commercial mortgage banking services. The Bank operates a loan production office in Valdosta, Georgia which will be replaced by a full-service banking center in the second quarter of 2010. Markets The Corporation conducts banking activities in multiple counties in southwest Georgia. Agriculture plays an important part in the economy of the Bank's market area. A large portion of Georgia's produce crops, which include turnips, cabbage, sweet potatoes, and squash, and producers of tobacco, peanuts, and cotton are grown in the Bank's market area. In addition, manufacturing firms, service industries, and retail stores employ a large number of residents in the Bank's market area. Apparel, lumber and wood products, and textile manufacturers are among the various types of manufacturers located in the Bank's market area. Empire provides mortgage banking services which includes underwriting, construction, and long-term financing of commercial properties principally throughout the Southeastern United States. Deposits The Bank offers a full range of depository accounts and services to both consumers and businesses. At December 31, 2009, the Corporation's deposit base, totaling $235,431,011, consisted of $41,021,846 in noninterest-bearing demand deposits (17.4% of total deposits), $70,769,089 in interest-bearing demand deposits including money market accounts (30.1% of total deposits), $21,364,824 in savings deposits (9.1% of total deposits), $72,085,244 in time deposits in amounts less than $100,000 (30.6% of total deposits), and $30,190,008 in time deposits of $100,000 or more (12.8% of total deposits). Loans The Bank makes both secured and unsecured loans to individuals, corporations, and other businesses. Both consumer and commercial lending operations include various types of credit for the Bank's customers. Secured loans include first and second real estate mortgage loans. The Bank also makes direct installment loans to consumers on both a secured and unsecured basis. At December 31, 2009, consumer installment, real estate (including construction and mortgage loans), and commercial (including financial and agricultural) loans represented approximately 6.3%, 77.6% and 16.1%, respectively, of the Bank's total loan portfolio. Lending Policy The current lending policy of the Bank is to offer consumer and commercial credit services to individuals and businesses that meet the Bank's credit standards. The Bank provides each lending officer with written guidelines for lending activities. Lending authority is delegated by the Board of Directors of the Bank to loan officers, each of whom is limited in the amount of secured and unsecured loans which can be made to a single borrower or related group of borrowers. The Loan Committee of the Bank's Board of Directors is responsible for approving and monitoring the loan policy and providing guidance and counsel to all lending personnel. It also approves all extensions of credit over $200,000. The Loan Committee is composed of the Chief Executive Officer and President, and other executive officers of the Bank, as well as certain Bank Directors. Servicing and Origination Fees on Loans The Corporation through its subsidiary, Empire, recognizes as income in the current period all loan origination and brokerage fees collected on loans closed for investing participants. Loan servicing fees are based on a percentage of loan interest paid by the borrower and are recognized over the term of the loan as loan payments are received. Empire does not directly fund any mortgages and acts as a service-oriented broker for participating mortgage lenders. Fees charged for continuing servicing fees are comparable with market rates. In 2009, Bank revenue received from mortgage banking services was $1,327,193 compared with $2,020,988 in 2008. All of this income was from Empire except for $109,517 in 2009 and $29,432 in 2008, which was mortgage banking income from the Bank. Loan Review and Nonperforming Assets The Bank regularly reviews its loan portfolio to determine deficiencies and corrective action to be taken. Loan reviews are prepared by the Bank's loan review officer and presented periodically to the Board's Loan Committee and the Audit Committee. Also, the Bank's external auditors conduct independent loan review adequacy tests and include their findings annually as part of their overall report to the Audit Committee and to the Board of Directors. Certain loans are monitored more often by the loan review officer and the Loan Committee. These loans include non-accruing loans, loans more than 90 days past due, and other loans, regardless of size, that may be considered high risk based on factors defined within the Bank's loan review policy. Asset/Liability Management The Asset/Liability Management Committee ("ALCO") is charged with establishing policies to manage the assets and liabilities of the Bank. Its task is to manage asset growth, net interest margin, liquidity, and capital in order to maximize income and reduce interest rate risk. To meet these objectives while maintaining prudent management of risks, the ALCO directs the Bank's overall acquisition and allocation of funds. At its monthly meetings, the ALCO reviews and discusses the monthly asset and liability funds budget and income and expense budget in relation to the actual composition and flow of funds; the ratio of the amount of rate sensitive assets to the amount of rate sensitive liabilities; the ratio of loan loss reserve to outstanding loans; and other variables, such as expected loan demand, investment opportunities, core deposit growth within specified categories, regulatory changes, monetary policy adjustments, and the overall state of the local, state, and national economy. The Bank's Loan Committee oversees the ALCO. Investment Policy The Bank's investment portfolio policy is to maximize income consistent with liquidity, asset quality, and regulatory constraints. The policy is reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors. Individual transactions, portfolio composition, and performance are reviewed and approved monthly by the Board of Directors. Employees The Bank had 110 full-time employees at December 31, 2009. The Bank is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement, and the Bank believes that its employee relations are good. Competition The banking business is highly competitive. The Bank and Empire compete with other depository institutions and other financial service organizations, including brokers, finance companies, savings and loan associations, credit unions and certain governmental agencies. The Bank ranks fifth out of seventeen banks in a five county region (Baker, Brooks, Colquitt, Thomas, and Worth) in deposit market share. Monetary Policies The results of operations of the Bank are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve"). The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve include open market operations in U. S. Government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, as well as the effect of action by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the Federal Reserve, no prediction can be made as to possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand, or the business and earnings of the Bank. Payment of Dividends The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Most of the revenue of the Corporation results from dividends paid to it by the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by the Bank, as well as by the Corporation to its shareholders. Under the regulations of the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance ("DBF"), dividends may not be declared out of the retained earnings of a state bank without first obtaining the written permission of the DBF, unless such bank meets all the following requirements: (a) total classified assets as of the most recent examination of the bank do not exceed 80% of equity capital (as defined by regulation); (b) the aggregate amount of dividends declared or anticipated to be declared in the calendar year does not exceed 50% of the net profits after taxes but before dividends for the previous calendar year; and (c) the ratio of equity capital to adjusted assets is not less than 6%. The payment of dividends by the Corporation and the Bank may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. In addition, if, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending upon the financial condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends), such authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such practice. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") has issued a policy statement providing that insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. In addition to the formal statutes and regulations, regulatory authorities consider the adequacy of each of the Bank's total capital in relation to its assets, deposits and other such items. Capital adequacy considerations could further limit the availability of dividends to the Bank. At December 31, 2009, net assets available from the Bank to pay dividends without prior approval from regulatory authorities totaled $945,494 thousand. For 2009, the Corporation's cash dividend payout to stockholders was $178,349 thousand which was declared in 2008. Supervision and Regulation General. The following is a brief summary of the supervision and regulation of the Corporation and the Bank as financial institutions and is not intended to be a complete discussion of all NYSE Amex (the "Amex"), state or federal rules, statutes and regulations affecting their operations, or that apply generally to business corporations or Amex listed companies. Changes in the rules, statutes and regulations applicable to the Corporation and the Bank can affect the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. The Corporation is a registered bank holding company subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Corporation Act of 1956, as amended (the "Act"). The Corporation is required to file annual and quarterly financial information with the Federal Reserve and is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve. The Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve's prior approval before (1) it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank that it does not already control; (2) it or any of its non-bank subsidiaries may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of a bank; and (3) it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. In addition, a bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of the voting shares of any company engaged in non-banking activities. This prohibition does not apply to activities listed in the Act or found by the Federal Reserve, by order or regulation, to be closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the activities that the Federal Reserve has determined by regulation or order to be closely related to banking are: * making or servicing loans and certain types of leases; * performing certain data processing services; * acting as fiduciary or investment or financial advisor; * providing brokerage services; * underwriting bank eligible securities; * underwriting debt and equity securities on a limited basis through separately capitalized subsidiaries; and * making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare. Although the activities of bank holding companies have traditionally been limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking (as discussed above), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the "GLB Act") relaxed the previous limitations and permitted bank holding companies to engage in a broader range of financial activities. Specifically, bank holding companies may elect to become financial holding companies which may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature. Among the activities that are deemed "financial in nature" include: * lending, exchanging, transferring, investing for others or safeguarding money or securities; * insuring, guaranteeing, or indemnifying against loss, harm, damage, illness, disability, or death, or providing and issuing annuities, and acting as principal, agent, or broker with respect thereto; * providing financial, investment, or economic advisory services, including advising an investment company; * issuing or selling instruments representing interests in pools of assets permissible for a bank to hold directly; and * underwriting, dealing in or making a market in securities. A bank holding company may become a financial holding company under this statute only if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized, is well managed and has at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. A bank holding company that falls out of compliance with such requirement may be required to cease engaging in certain activities. Any bank holding company that does not elect to become a financial holding company remains subject to the bank holding company restrictions of the Act. Under this legislation, the Federal Reserve Board serves as the primary "umbrella" regulator of financial holding companies with supervisory authority over each parent company and limited authority over its subsidiaries. The primary regulator of each subsidiary of a financial holding company will depend on the type of activity conducted by the subsidiary. For example, broker-dealer subsidiaries will be regulated largely by securities regulators and insurance subsidiaries will be regulated largely by insurance authorities. The Corporation has no current plans to register as a financial holding company. The Corporation must also register with the DBF and file periodic information with the DBF. As part of such registration, the DBF requires information with respect to the financial condition, operations, management and intercompany relationships of the Corporation and the Bank and related matters. The DBF may also require such other information as is necessary to keep itself informed as to whether the provisions of Georgia law and the regulations and orders issued thereunder by the DBF have been complied with, and the DBF may examine the Corporation and the Bank. The Corporation is an "affiliate" of the Bank under the Federal Reserve Act, which imposes certain restrictions on (1) loans by the Bank to the Corporation, (2) investments in the stock or securities of the Corporation by the Bank, (3) the Bank's taking the stock or securities of an "affiliate" as collateral for loans by the Bank to a borrower, and (4) the purchase of assets from the Corporation by the Bank. Further, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of services. The Bank is regularly examined by the FDIC. As a state banking association organized under Georgia law the Bank is subject to the supervision and the regular examination of the DBF. Both the FDIC and DBF must grant prior approval of any merger, consolidation or other corporation reorganization involving the Bank. Capital Adequacy. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have implemented substantially identical risk-based rules for assessing bank and bank holding company capital adequacy. These regulations establish minimum capital standards in relation to assets and off-balance sheet exposures as adjusted for credit risk. Banks and bank holding companies are required to have (1) a minimum level of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%; and (2) a minimum Tier I Capital to risk-weighted assets of 4%. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have established a minimum 3% leverage ratio of Tier I Capital to quarterly average total assets for the most highly-rated banks and bank holding companies. "Tier I Capital" generally consists of common equity excluding unrecognized gains and losses on available for sale securities, plus minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and certain perpetual preferred stock less certain intangibles. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC will require a bank holding company and a bank, respectively, to maintain a leverage ratio greater than 4% if either is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less than well-diversified risks in the opinion of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC use the leverage ratio in tandem with the risk- based ratio to assess the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies. The FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC") and the Federal Reserve consider interest rate risk in the overall determination of a bank's capital ratio, requiring banks with greater interest rate risk to maintain adequate capital for the risk. The "prompt corrective action" provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act set forth five regulatory zones in which all banks are placed largely based on their capital positions. Regulators are permitted to take increasingly harsh action as a bank's financial condition declines. Regulators are also empowered to place in receivership or require the sale of a bank to another depository institution when a bank's capital leverage ratio reaches 2%. Better capitalized institutions are generally subject to less onerous regulation and supervision than banks with lesser amounts of capital. The FDIC has adopted regulations implementing the prompt corrective action provisions of the 1991 Act, which place financial institutions in the following five categories based upon capitalization ratios: (1) a "well capitalized" institution has a Total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier I risk-based ratio of at least 6% and a leverage ratio of at least 5%; (2) an "adequately capitalized" institution has a Total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier I risk-based ratio of at least 4% and a leverage ratio of at least 4%; (3) an "undercapitalized" institution has a Total risk-based capital ratio of under 8%, a Tier I risk-based ratio of under 4% or a leverage ratio of under 4%; (4) a "significantly undercapitalized" institution has a Total risk-based capital ratio of under 6%, a Tier I risk-based ratio of under 3% or a leverage ratio of under 3%; and (5) a "critically undercapitalized" institution has a leverage ratio of 2% or less. Institutions in any of the three undercapitalized categories would be prohibited from declaring dividends or making capital distributions. The FDIC regulations also establish procedures for "downgrading" an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital. To continue to conduct its business as currently conducted, the Corporation and the Bank will need to maintain capital well above the minimum levels. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the most recent notifications from the FDIC categorized the Bank as "well capitalized" under current regulations. Commercial Real Estate. In December, 2007 the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, issued a final guidance on concentrations in commercial real estate lending, noting that recent increases in banks' commercial real estate concentrations could create safety and soundness concerns in the event of a significant economic downturn. The guidance mandates certain minimal risk management practices and categorizes banks with defined levels of such concentrations as banks requiring elevated examiner scrutiny. The Bank has a concentration in commercial real estate loans in excess of those defined levels. Management believes that the Corporation's credit processes and procedures meet the risk management standards dictated by this guidance, but it is not yet possible to determine the impact this guidance may have on examiner attitudes with respect to the Bank's real estate concentrations, which attitudes could effectively limit increases in the Bank's loan portfolios and require additional credit administration and management costs associated with those portfolios. Loans. Inter-agency guidelines adopted by federal bank regulators mandate that financial institutions establish real estate lending policies with maximum allowable real estate loan-to-value limits, subject to an allowable amount of non-conforming loans as a percentage of capital. The Bank adopted the federal guidelines in 2001. Transactions with Affiliates. Under federal law, all transactions between and among a state nonmember bank and its affiliates, which include holding companies, are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated thereunder. Generally, these requirements limit these transactions to a percentage of the bank's capital and require all of them to be on terms at least as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, a bank may not lend to any affiliate engaged in non-banking activities not permissible for a bank holding company or acquire shares of any affiliate that is not a subsidiary. The FDIC is authorized to impose additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates if necessary to protect the safety and soundness of a bank. The regulations also set forth various reporting requirements relating to transactions with affiliates. Financial Privacy. In accordance with the GLB Act, federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. Anti-Money Laundering Initiatives and the USA Patriot Act. A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating terrorist financing. This has generally been accomplished by amending existing anti-money laundering laws and regulations. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the "USA Patriot Act") has imposed significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties. The United States Treasury Department ("Treasury") has issued a number of implementing regulations which apply to various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to the Corporation and the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. On November 21, 2008, the Board of Directors of the FDIC adopted a final rule relating to the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program ("TLG Program"). The TLG Program was announced by the FDIC on October 14, 2008, preceded by the determination of systemic risk by Treasury, as an initiative to counter the system-wide crisis in the nation's financial sector. Under the TLG Program the FDIC will (i) guarantee, through the earlier of maturity or June 30, 2012, certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by participating institutions and (ii) provide unlimited FDIC deposit insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction deposit accounts, Negotiable Order of Withdrawal accounts paying less than 0.5% interest per annum and Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts held at participating FDIC-insured institutions through June 30, 2010. After which time the coverage will return to $250,000 limit until December 30, 2013. Coverage under the TLG Program was available for the first 30 days without charge. The fee assessment for coverage of senior unsecured debt ranges from 50 basis points to 100 basis points per annum, depending on the initial maturity of the debt. The fee assessment for deposit insurance coverage is 10 basis points per quarter on amounts in covered accounts exceeding $250,000. The Corporation elected to participate in only the full FDIC deposit insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction deposit accounts and others. Future Legislation. Various legislation affecting financial institutions and the financial industry is from time to time introduced. Such legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Corporation and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways, and could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance depending upon whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that it or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. With the recent enactments of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions is very unpredictable at this time.

Table 2 - Rate/Volume Analysis The following table sets forth, for the indicated years ended December 31, a summary of the changes in interest paid resulting from changes in volume and changes in rate. The change due to volume is calculated by multiplying the change in volume by the prior year's rate. The change due to rate is calculated by multiplying the change in rate by the prior year's volume. The change attributable to both volume and rate is calculated by multiplying the change in volume by the change in rate.

Table 3 - Investment Portfolio The carrying values of investment securities for the indicated years are presented below: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Securities held to maturity: U.S. Government Agencies $ 998 $ 5,996 $ 82,991 State and municipal 9,003 6,112 5,235 Residential mortgage-backed 14,194 0 0 Total securities held to maturity $ 24,195 $ 12,108 $ 88,226 Securities available for sale: U.S. Government Agencies $ 0 $ 15,036 $ 17,890 State and municipal 5,945 10,768 12,973 Residential mortgage-backed 50,041 50,011 295 Corporate notes 5,877 7,284 0 Equity securities 145 113 30 Total securities available for sale $ 62,008 $ 83,212 $ 31,188 The total investment portfolio decreased to $87,853,321 from $96,938,621 at year-end 2009 compared with year-end 2008, a decrease of $9,085,300, or 9.3%. The majority of this decrease was due to maturities and calls of approximately $25,000,000 of U.S. Government Agency and tax-free municipal securities. Also, there were $9,593,965 sales of longer-term residential mortgage-backed securities, corporate notes and preferred stock for a gain of $255,324. The residential mortgage-backed securities principal paydowns were approximately $10,000,000. The Bank reinvested $35,995,038 of these funds mainly in short-term government sponsored residential mortgage-backed securities. Other purchases were of state and municipal securities. The following table shows the expected maturities of debt securities at December 31, 2009, and the weighted average yields (for nontaxable obligations on a fully taxable basis assuming a 34% tax rate) of such securities. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations without call or prepayment penalties. Mortgage backed securities amortize in accordance with the terms of the underlying mortgages, including prepayments as a result of refinancings and other early payoffs.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, securities carried at approximately $41,314,406 and $69,395,794, respectively, were pledged to secure public and trust deposits as required by law. At year-end 2009, approximately $12 million was overpledged and could be released if necessary for liquidity needs. In 2009, we no longer pledged securities to secure Federal Home Loan Bank advances. In 2008, securities carried at $28,615,000 were pledged to secure these advances.

This analysis includes a study of loss experience, a review of delinquencies, and an estimate of the possibility of loss in view of the risk characteristics of the portfolio. Based on the above factors, management considers the current allowance to be adequate. Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses Management has allocated the allowance for loan losses within the categories of loans set forth in the table below according to amounts deemed reasonably necessary to provide for possible losses. The amount of the allowance applicable to each category and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans are presented below.

Management believes that the portfolio is diversified and, to a large extent, secured without undue concentrations in any specific risk area. Control of loan quality is regularly monitored by management, the loan committee, and is reviewed by the Bank's Board of Directors which meets monthly. Independent external review of the loan portfolio is provided by examinations conducted by regulatory authorities. The amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses charged to operating expense for the periods indicated were based upon many factors, including actual charge offs and evaluations of current economic conditions in the market area. Management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover any potential loan losses. Table 5 - Deposits The average amounts of deposits for the last three years are presented below.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in the Corporation's common stock and the Corporation's financial results are subject to a number of risks. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those generally affecting the industry in which the Corporation operates and risks that management currently deems immaterial may arise or become material in the future and affect the Corporation's business. As a bank holding company, adverse conditions in the general business or economic environment could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operation. Continued weakness or adverse changes in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the markets in which the Corporation operates could adversely impact our business, including causing one or more of the following negative developments: * a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Corporation; * a decrease in the value of the Corporation's loans secured by consumer or commercial real estate; * an impairment of the Corporation's assets, such as its intangible assets, goodwill, or deferred tax assets; or * an increase in the number of customers or other counterparties who default on their loans or other obligations to the Corporation, which could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provision for loan losses. For example, if the Corporation is unable to continue to generate, or demonstrate that it can continue to generate, sufficient taxable income in the near future, then it may not be able to fully realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets and may be required to recognize a valuation allowance, similar to an impairment of those assets, if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the Corporation's deferred tax assets will not be realized. Such a development, or one or more other negative developments resulting from adverse conditions in the general business or economic environment, some of which are described above, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation's ability to raise capital could be limited and could affect its liquidity and could be dilutive to existing shareholders. Current conditions in the capital markets are such that traditional sources of capital may not be available to the Corporation on reasonable terms if it needed to raise capital. In such case, there is no guarantee that the Corporation will be able to borrow funds or successfully raise additional capital at all or on terms that are favorable or otherwise not dilutive to existing shareholders. Liquidity is essential to the Corporation's businesses and it relies on external sources to finance a significant portion of our operations. Liquidity is essential to the Corporation's businesses. The Corporation's capital resources and liquidity could be negatively impacted by disruptions in its ability to access these sources of funding. With increased concerns about bank failures, traditional deposit customers are increasingly concerned about the extent to which their deposits are insured by the FDIC. Customers may withdraw deposits from the Corporation's subsidiary bank in an effort to ensure that the amount that they have on deposit is fully insured. In addition, the cost of brokered and other out-of-market deposits and potential future regulatory limits on the interest rate the Corporation may pay for brokered deposits could make them unattractive sources of funding. Factors that the Corporation cannot control, such as disruption of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry generally, could impair its ability to raise funding. Other financial institutions may be unwilling to extend credit to banks because of concerns about the banking industry and the economy generally and, given recent downturns in the economy, there may not be a viable market for raising short or long-term debt or equity capital. In addition, the Corporation's ability to raise funding could be impaired if lenders develop a negative perception of its long-term or short-term financial prospects. Such negative perceptions could be developed if the Corporation is downgraded or put on (or remain on) negative watch by the rating agencies, suffers a decline in the level of its business activity or regulatory authorities take significant action against it, among other reasons. If the Corporation is unable to raise funding using the methods described above, it would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets to meet maturing liabilities. The corporation may be unable to sell some of its assets, or it may have to sell assets at a discount from market value, either of which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. The Corporation's construction and land development loans are subject to unique risks that could adversely affect earnings. The Corporation's construction and land development loan portfolio was $15.6 million at December 31, 2009, comprising 9.7% of total loans. Construction and land development loans are often riskier than home equity loans or residential mortgage loans to individuals. In the event of a general economic slowdown, they would represent higher risk due to slower sales and reduced cash flow that could impact the borrowers' ability to repay on a timely basis. In addition, although regulations and regulatory policies affecting banks and financial services companies undergo continuous change and we cannot predict when changes will occur or the ultimate effect of any changes, there has been recent regulatory focus on construction, development and other commercial real estate lending. Recent changes in the federal policies applicable to construction, development or other commercial real estate loans make us subject to substantial limitations with respect to making such loans, increase the costs of making such loans, and require us to have a greater amount of capital to support this kind of lending, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or financial condition. Recent performance may not be indicative of future performance. Various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations, competition and the ability to find and retain talented people, may impede the Corporation's ability to remain profitable. A deterioration in asset quality could have an adverse impact on the Corporation. A significant source of risk for the Corporation arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing the repayment of these loans includes a wide variety of diverse real and personal property that may be affected by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, environmental contamination and other external events. In addition, decreases in real estate property values due to the nature of the Bank's loan portfolio, over 77% of which is secured by real estate, could affect the ability of customers to repay their loans. The Bank's loan policies and procedures may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Changes in prevailing interest rates may negatively affect the results of operations of the Corporation and the value of its assets. The Corporation's earnings depend largely on the relationship between the yield on earning assets, primarily loans and investments, and the cost of funds, primarily deposits and borrowings. This relationship, known as the interest rate spread, is subject to fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors which influence interest rates, the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the level of non-performing assets. Fluctuations in interest rates affect the demand of customers for the Corporation's products and services. In addition, interest-bearing liabilities may re-price or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than interest-earning assets. Significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Changes in the level of interest rates may also negatively affect the value of the Corporation's assets and its ability to realize book value from the sale of those assets, all of which ultimately affect earnings. If the Corporation's allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, earnings would decrease. The Bank's loan customers may not repay their loans according to their terms and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. The Bank may experience significant loan losses which would have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's operating results. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of the loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. The Corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses in an attempt to cover any loan losses inherent in the portfolio. In determining the size of the allowance, management relies on an analysis of the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and types of loans, trends in classification, volume and trends in delinquencies and non- accruals, national and local economic conditions and other pertinent information. As a result of these considerations, the Corporation has from time to time increased its allowance for loan losses. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Corporation recorded an allowance for possible loan losses of $2.53 million, compared with $2.38 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. If those assumptions are incorrect, the allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in the loan portfolio. The Corporation may be subject to losses due to fraudulent and negligent conduct of the Bank's and Empire's loan customers, third party service providers and employees. When the Bank and Empire make loans to individuals or entities, they rely upon information supplied by borrowers and other third parties, including information contained in the applicant's loan application, property appraisal reports, title information and the borrower's net worth, liquidity and cash flow information. While they attempt to verify information provided through available sources, they cannot be certain all such information is correct or complete. The Bank and Empire's reliance on incorrect or incomplete information could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's profitability or financial condition. Technology difficulties or failures could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation. The Corporation depends upon data processing, software, communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks and over the internet. The Corporation cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures. The Corporation relies on the services of a variety of vendors to meet its data processing and communication needs. If information security is breached or other technology difficulties or failures occur, information may be lost or misappropriated, services and operations may be interrupted and the Corporation could be exposed to claims from customers. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The Corporation's business is subject to the success of the local economies and real estate markets in which it operates. The Corporation's banking operations are located in southwest Georgia. Because of the geographic concentration of its operations, the Corporation's success significantly depends largely upon economic conditions in this area, which include volatility in the agricultural market, influx and outflow of major employers in the area, minimal population growth throughout the region. Deterioration in economic conditions in the communities in which the Corporation operates could adversely affect the quality of the Corporation's loan portfolio and the demand for its products and services, and accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The Corporation is less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of more diverse economies. The Corporation may face risks with respect to its ability to execute its business strategy. The financial performance and profitability of the Corporation will depend on its ability to execute its strategic plan and manage its future growth. Moreover, the Corporation's future performance is subject to a number of factors beyond its control, including pending and future federal and state banking legislation, regulatory changes, unforeseen litigation outcomes, inflation, lending and deposit rate changes, interest rate fluctuations, increased competition and economic conditions. Accordingly, these issues could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The Corporation depends on its key personnel, and the loss of any of them could adversely affect the Corporation. The Corporation's success depends to a significant extent on the management skills of its existing executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with the Corporation for many years. The loss or unavailability of any of its key personnel, including G. DeWitt Drew, President and CEO, John J. Cole, Jr., Executive Vice President, C. Wallace Sansbury, Executive Vice President, George R. Kirkland, Senior Vice President & Treasurer and Charles R. Lemons, President and CEO of Empire, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition, and results of operations or liquidity. Competition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect the Corporation. The banking business is highly competitive, and the Corporation experiences competition in its markets from many other financial institutions. The Corporation competes with these other financial institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. Many of its competitors are well- established, larger financial institutions that are able to operate profitably with a narrower net interest margin and have a more diverse revenue base. The Corporation may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of its smaller size, lack of geographic diversification and inability to spread costs across broader markets. There can be no assurance that the Corporation will be able to compete effectively in its markets. Furthermore, developments increasing the nature or level of competition could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Changes in government regulation or monetary policy could adversely affect the Corporation. The Corporation and the banking industry are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations. The restrictions imposed by such laws and regulations limit the manner in which the Corporation conducts its banking business, undertakes new investments and activities and obtains financing. These regulations are designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit holders of the Corporation's securities. Financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future, none of which is in the control of the Corporation. Significant new laws or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Further, federal monetary policy, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve System, significantly affects credit conditions for the Corporation, and any unfavorable change in these conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS The Corporation has not received any written comments from the Securities Exchange Commission staff in connection with a review of any of its reports.
