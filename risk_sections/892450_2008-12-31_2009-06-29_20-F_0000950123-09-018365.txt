Another 538 employees and 1,331 employees retired under KT Corporations voluntary early retirement plan in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Labor Relations We consider our current relations with our work force to be good. However, in the past, we have experienced opposition from our labor union for our strategy of restructuring to improve our efficiency and profitability by disposing of non-core businesses and reducing our employee base. Under Korean labor law, our employees are permitted to strike. However, because the maintenance of our network is in the public interest, the Government has the authority to mediate or arbitrate any strike, as well as any disagreement involving the collective bargaining process. Criminal proceedings may be brought against any party refusing Government mediation or arbitration. The current collective bargaining agreement provides that even in 68 Table of Contents the event of a strike, the minimum number of employees necessary to operate the telecommunications business must continue to work. As of December 31, 2008, about 81.1% of all employees of KT Corporation were members of the KT Trade Union. On behalf of its members, the Union negotiates with us a collective bargaining agreement every two years, and our current collective bargaining agreement expires on November 12, 2009. The Union also negotiates with us an annual agreement on wages on behalf of its members. In November 2008, the Union agreed to a salary freeze. The agreement includes a one-time bonus payment of W1 million per employee for 2008 as well as an increase in monthly meal and transportation allowance by W40,000 starting in 2009. In addition, we agreed to allocate W60 billion to the welfare fund to be used for employee benefits. Under the Act of the Promotion of Workers Participation and Cooperation, our Employee-Employer Cooperation Committees, which are composed of representatives of management and labor for each business unit and regional office, meet quarterly to discuss employee grievances, working conditions and potential employee-initiated improvements in service or management. Employee Stock Ownership and Benefits We have an employee stock ownership association, which may purchase on behalf of its members up to 20.0% of any of our shares offered publicly in Korea. The employee stock ownership association owned 4.8% of our issued shares as of December 31, 2008. We maintain a retirement and severance plan, as required by Korean labor law. Employees terminating their employment after one year or more of service are entitled to receive a lump-sum payment based upon the length of their service and their wage rates, with adjustments, at the time of termination. We make provision for our obligations under the retirement plan. In addition, we provide a wide range of fringe benefits to our employees, including physical education grants, meal allowances, housing, housing loans, medical examinations and training and resort centers. See Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  Item. 5.A. Operating Results  Salaries and Related Costs. Employee Training The objective of our training program is to develop information and technology specialists who are able to create value for our customers. In recent years, we have been focusing our efforts on development of (i) consultants who interact closely with our customers such as sales professionals and information and technology supporters, (ii) key management professionals and (iii) professionals who are dedicated to developing, marketing and servicing new growth businesses such as WiBro, IP-TV and VoIP. In order to develop skills of our employees, we require 100 hours of training per year from most of our employees, using personally-tailored curriculums based on individual assessments. We also operate Cyber Academy to provide online classes to our employees, as well as offer various foreign language classes to our employees. In addition, we provide tuition and living expense reimbursements to our high potential individuals who pursue graduate programs in Korea and abroad, as well as provide financial assistance to those who pursue work-related professional licenses or participate in after-work study programs. 69 Table of Contents Item 6.E.
